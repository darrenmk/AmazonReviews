# Summatti Data Scientist Coding Test

We're excited to go through the interview process with you! As a way for you to show us that you've got the skillset we're looking for
we've aggregated a small dataset of reviews from Amazon (not the public dataset) along with their rating and voted helpfulness.

With these data points try to demonstrate to us your data exploration process, any findings you come across, and train a model with the 
target of either the star ratings or the helpfulness (that's up to you). High accuracy isn't the highest priority, we'd rather see a well 
thought out approach and well explained metrics. We're interested in how you go through and discover features/interesting data points more
than just applying the latest greatest tech. If you feel there's something more interesting to be done rather than just predicting against
the targets, we'd love to see whatever it is you feel is more interesting. This is purposely slightly open ended.

Be sure whatever you create we can run (document dependencies) and just let us know how to via a README. The depth you go is up to you,
but ultimately we want the time spent on this to stay reasonable, but please let us know if you need more time to take it at your pace, 
or if you have any clarifying questions.
