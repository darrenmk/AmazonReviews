# Readme for Summatti Data Science Challenge

In this github repo I have written a Jupyter notebook for analyzing the interview_dataset.csv file. To execute the code, simply clone the repository to your local computer with git clone https://github.com/darrenmkz/AmazonReviews and open AmazonReviews.ipynb in Jupyter notebooks. I hope you enjoy :)
