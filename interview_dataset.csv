This item doesn’t have a lot number or expiration date. My face has broken out ever since using this. I didn’t put two and two together until I got a new one from my dermotologist. See photo. The one that is from my dermotologist has a lot # and expiration date.,1,"1,545",B002MSN3QQ
"La Roche Posay Anthelios has been my holy grail for years, but at some point, I wanted my sunscreen to have something else, so I switched to ELTA 46 SPF. Amazon is now an authorized retailer, so for those reviews saying there are counterfeit / fake products, it's not like that anymore! ELTA has some of the best ingredients in sunscreen you can imagine. Well, in any skincare product :) If you are looking for a good sunscreen, with extra benefits, go for this one. One of the best things is the coverage and protection. In Europe/Asia, most sunscreens have high rates both for UVA and UVB, but in the US, the main standard is SPF for UVB (rays causing burning, primarily), but not so much for UVA (UVA rays account for up to 95% of the UV radiation reaching the Earth's, and penetrates more deeply in the skin being more associated with aging process). Well, ELTA is one of those strange products (in the good sense) offering high protection for both, it does not leave a white cast, and it has ammaaaazing ingredients: Niacinamide comes high in the formulation (5%, as much as the overpriced NIA-24), and it's an all time star ingredient (antioxidant, brightens skin tone, treats hyperpigmentation, increases collagen, anti-inflammatory., etc), plus vitamin e, hyaluronic acid. Seriously, this lotion is game-changer, and very affordable for how good the formula is!",5,731,B002MSN3QQ
"To all the people worried about getting a knock off product: I contacted EltaMD directly and Amazon IS an authorized reseller. I would just make sure you're actually buying it from Amazon, not another party and Amazon is just shipping it.

The product is pretty good, doesn't make my face greasy. Unfortunately it doesn't really have any moisturizing benefits so I have to use it with a moisturizer. Also has a faint scent, bot not as bad as other sunscreens.",4,487,B002MSN3QQ
"I bought this per my dermatologist’s recommendation to work as a sunscreen and moisturizer for my rosacea, and it made me break out horribly. I used it 1-2 times per day for a week or two and felt it might be making me break out, so stopped with the hope I could at least use it on vacation as a sunblock. When I did this, applying multiple times per day, I thought I had gotten sunburned, when in actuality my face was just red, swollen, and pimply from this lotion - it all subsided a day or two after I stopped using it. I switched to normal Coppertone and had no problems with burn or breakouts after that. I have never had a reaction to any product as severe as I did this one, which is odd considering it is supposedly designed for sensitive skin types, so beware!",1,366,B002MSN3QQ
I’m very glad that I took a chance on the sunscreen! I was a bit skeptical due to the mixed reviews and there weren’t very many reviews that talked about whether there would be a white cast on dark skin. This product rubs on very smoothly and you can’t even feel that it’s there. My make up blends flawlessly with this underneath. This is the best sunscreen I’ve ever use on my face! It’s so thin and moisturizing. A little goes a long way so if you have a white cast you may have used too much. I have deep brown skin and there is no cast left.,5,155,B002MSN3QQ
"I really like this SPF cream. First of all it doesn't smell 'perfumey' - it might have a hint of suntan lotion smell, but it's really faint. Second this cream is NOT GREASY and disappears fast - even though it has 9% zinc oxide. Third it has 46+ SPF with 7.5 Octinoxate to slow burning. I've finally had to admit that I need a strong SPF; given past brushes with melanoma and the sincere desire to not have the hide of an alligator. And while not inexpensive, this is far less than the cost of a lot of the better-quality moisturizers for men. You usually get exactly what you pay for and this is worth every penny. Finally, my better half tells me that this company doesn't test on animals. I believe that's a good thing. ;-)

WARNING: Many buyers have received fake products from other sellers. Buy only when sold and shipped by Amazon! The authentic product will have a flat sloping pump top that is shown in the attached photo. The fake products have a rounded top.

Pros:
• Non greasy formula that easily absorbs into skin
• Odorless and transparent
• 9% Zinc Oxide provides long lasting protection
• 7+% Octinoxate to reduce burning by dispersing UVB rays
• Tested reliable 30+ SPF
• UVA/UVB sun protection

Cons:
• More expensive than drug-store brands",5,258,B002MSN3QQ
"I can't attest to the efficacy of the product, just posting to say, I had negative reactions to it. I have just crested the high side of mid-40s and really wanted to find a good daily sun protectant to guard against [further] aging. This was so well-reviewed, I chose it over the next closest contenders, Roche-Posay products (which I usually love).

Unfortunately, the first week of using it, I began to get tiny bumps on my face (not visible to the naked eye, but easily perceived with fingertips when washing or applying moisturizer). I had also been using a new 'flavor' of body lotion, so I went back to my basic tried-and-true products to let everything calm down for a bit, and try to definitively eliminate the culprit.

After two weeks, I again applied this on two successive days when I'd be out in the sun for an extended period. On Day 1, once I'd gotten outside and had started perspiring, my neck began burning, then itching maddeningly -- I was only outside in my yard gardening, so ran inside and I washed it thoroughly off my neck. My face seemed okay, so I left it there, and applied the product again to my ears and face (no neck) on Day 2 when heading out for a long weekend walk.

This time, again once I'd gotten outside and started perspiring, the product started burning and itching around my eyebrows and general eye area. I washed it off as best I could at the next public water fountain.

The next day, I began to show itchy, painful swollen patches on my face, ears, and throat (the latter pictured as best I could, but it was difficult to shoot an area I couldn't see!) This time, there had been no other 'new to me' product used, nor was there anything else that I carefully applied to ears/face/throat, all areas that then became rashy....

So alas, not a product I can use, and alas for the waste of a significant amount of money. >:/ I've used other physical sunscreens in the past (eg Badger) without any issues, so it must be some substance in the cream besides that causing the problem.",1,80,B002MSN3QQ
"I emailed EltaMD regarding the validity of the product, here is their response as of yesterday, 9/22/15

I give it 3 stars because of my skepticism, but I love the product I have received, assuming it's legitimate.",3,699,B002MSN3QQ
"I discovered too late that this contains Octinoxate, an established endocrine disruptor, rated 5 by EWG. It's also harmful to corals and implicated in coral bleaching, and sunscreens containing octinoxate are now banned in Hawaii. Extremely disappointing to find it in a respected brand. Stick with zinc oxide: there are lots of great alternative bio and eco-friendly brands. From Campaign for Safe Cosmetics: ""Octinoxate, also called Octyl methoxycinnamate or (OMC), is a UV filter. It can be absorbed rapidly through skin. Octinoxate has been detected in human urine, blood and breast milk, which indicates that humans are systemically exposed to this compound. Octinoxate is an endocrine disruptor that mimics estrogen and can disrupt thyroid function.""",1,28,B002MSN3QQ
"I agree Amazon should not sell this product. It should be removed from the list right away. I had melanoma several years ago. And bought this thinking I was making the best decision to protect my skin. I had an allergic reaction, I thought there was something wrong with my blood pressure. The next day my face was covered in welts. My fave still is itching and burning. DO NOT BUY THIS. Protect yourself and your skin.",1,35,B002MSN3QQ
"I LOVE this product for my rosacea prone skin. I recently tried to deviate to skinceutical spf, after using this for years, and broke out horribly. I ran to my closest derm to buy the EltaMD again.

I did buy this ONCE on Amazon (quite a while ago) and I got something that did not look like the product. It was the same texture, but kind of yellowish. That bottle, like one of the previous posters showed, did not have an expiration stamp. The bottles usually do have an expiration stamp on the bottom.

So, I still give it 5 stars for exceptional performance on sensitive skin and great sun protection, but recommend buying it in person, just to make sure you're getting the product you expect.

I decided to reach out recently to ask EltaMD about buying online (I was having difficulty locating it locally). Here's what EltaMD recently told me about Amazon being an authorized seller, dated 9/10/19.

"This is an excellent mineral sunscreen, but it WILL leave an obvious white cast on dark skin (I'm an NW44). There are some reviewers here who claim that it doesn't-- either they're not using the correct amount (1/4 teaspoon for the face) or they're lighter skinned than I am. Another thing is that it is quite drying and does leave a sheen on the skin once it has set-- this is easily corrected with a light dusting of powder (and it primes makeup beautifully) but you can't leave the house without it.",4,60,B002MSN3QQ
"it's difficult to give 1 star reviews but i felt like i had to write it just to get my opinion heard on this lotion. for UV protection i would say it's like most face sunscreens out there, my face did not break out nor did it get red. I have rosacea, oily skin, and very sensitive skin! (a killer combination i know).

the big problem i have is that is leaves your face WHITE! I've tried to put a liberal amount and a small amount. I tried using this only during the day, in combination with other lotions, after a toner. But it's still unbelievable white. Perhaps it would be better for light/fair skinned individuals, but i'm pretty tan so it looks like i put a layer of white out on my face. The final straw was when my classmate told me, ""Why is your face so white??"" Pretty embarrassing, and having acne is embarrassing enough.

Maybe this is more of a rant than a review, but if you like have your face looking like a ghost, by all means get this product. But if you have a tan/darker skinned complexion, i would stay away.",1,41,B002MSN3QQ
Used once. Caused reaction on face and broke out in hives. (See picture) Im unsure what ingredient would have caused such a severe reaction. Discontinued use and swelling and hives went away within 24 hours. Be careful.,1,25,B002MSN3QQ

"I’ve ordered and used this all-mineral spf product twice now. The pros: It does not sting my rosacea-prone skin, nor does it leave much of a white cast. The cons: It does leave my skin shiny and has a slight odor which I do not like (it fades quickly). The worst issue is the pilling. Not sometimes. Always. If I don’t rub it in just so and try to massage in a white streak, it pills. If I touch my face or neck, it pills. If I try to gently dust some powder on to mitigate the shine, it pills. The best sunscreen is one you like to use every day. This is not it.",1,14,B002MSN3QQ
"I've been using this product for two years and will not be without it for my morning routine. I carry one in my purse for driving (sun exposure) and reapply throughout the day if I leave the house or buildings. I'm nearly 60 y.o. and Asian. I used to have sun damaged age spots but since using this sunscreen, most faded and keeping my skin smooth.
Be sure to reapply religiously every two hours and wear a wide brim hat. I also started to use it on the back of my hands to prevent more spots from forming.
It's barely scented and pleasant. Easy to apply and not oily or sticky. It's easy to absorb and not chalky or leaving any unpleasant feel or reaction. My skin is not sensitive and has always been on a light to medium tone, depending on the seasons.
I recommend it to women of my age. And by the way, drink a lot of water and wear a hat whenever possible. I also don't lay out in the sun to tan either. I think that helps.",5,7,B002MSN3QQ
"My skin is acne-prone and dehydrated thanks to Tazorac. After cutting out dairy, I finally figured out why Tazorac could not keep me completely clear... EltaMD UV Clear. What was supposed to help combat the side effects of Tazorac actually impeded its effects.

EltaMD UV Clear causes clogged pores on my forehead and chin, and I typically get cystic acne on my chin because of it.

I have decided to halt Tazorac and all actives for now to let my skin barrier heal while I try to find a sunscreen that will not break me out.",1,22,B002MSN3QQ
"Update 5/28/18:

I initially gave this product 5 stars because it truly is a great product. However I did have to update my review due to the amount of product for the price I paid. This bottle of sunscreen contains 1.7 oz of product. For sunscreen application on the face, it is recommended that you use at least half a teaspoon worth (just for your face alone, not your neck). That half a teaspoon is about 0.083 oz per application. So the bottle can last you 20 applications, not days, applications (since it's recommended you apply every 2 to 3 hours). To pay more than 30 bucks for less than a month's worth of usage seems to be really pricey.

//

Pleasantly surprised with this sunscreen. I live in Arizona and I know for a fact that I haven't been using as much sunscreen as I should have. The problem was that it was always so tacky, greasy, left a white cast, and irritated my skin. I've been using this sunscreen for at least a week now, and it wasn't irritating to my sensitive skin at all. It applies easily. It's not watery but has a consistency of a thicker moisturizer. There's an initial cast as you are spreading the sunscreen evenly, but it goes away quite quickly. Sometimes I run into the issue with a gritty feeling left over after I apply sunscreen, I didn't have that issue with this one. It left my skin feeling plump and allowed me to apply my tinted moisturizer/make up after without any issues. I have oily/combo skin and this did not increase my sebum production at all, so that's definitely a plus.

The recommended amount of sunscreen to apply to one's face is half a teaspoon (just the face), so this bottle is on the smaller size for what it costs.

I had tried this sunscreen on the recommendation of a well-known influencer but had been debating between a more cost-effective (but seemingly just as good alternative). Missha's waterproof Sun Milk is a great contender with this sunscreen, for almost half the price! I'll see how the two compare.",3,14,B002MSN3QQ
"If you are debating on getting this, get the drmtlgy spf 45 instead!! Do your research first. This product bills and balls up so bad even with one simple moisturizer on underneath. Even without a moisturizer on, still balled up, so never mind re-applying. Can’t do anything with this sunscreen. I ordered the drmtlgy one instead and it doesn’t pill, almost identical ingredients, it’s cheaper and you get 2 oz of product. So yeah this is just all around not good I can’t believe the hype this product gets.",2,6,B002MSN3QQ
"I use to love this product and have been using it religiously for the last 7 years. However recently I came across company based in Canada called The Sunscreen Company who claims to have sent the products out for third party testing and ELTA MD spf 46 performed poorly in UVA protection factor values. UVA rays are responsible for aging and wrinkles. Since I love the product and wanted to continue using it, I emailed ELTA MD for re-assurance but never got a response from them.

Personally, I am inclined to trust the 3rd party findings because micronized zinc (like that used in EltaMD) inherently does not offer strong UVA protection, especially when included in such a low concentration (which is only one factor of the entire formulation process that contributes to final protection values). I’d love for EltaMD to perform testing and refute the data here, because I do want to go back to using their elegant formulas, but until then, I don’t have faith they offer good uva protection.",3,5,B002MSN3QQ
"I have been wearing sunscreen on my face everyday for about 7 years now. I've tried a lot different sunscreens and hated pretty much everything I tried. It either left a white cast, burned my skin and eyes, pilled up immediately, or was horrible under makeup. This sunscreen is not only good - but I actually enjoy wearing it!

I love almost everything about this sunscreen... my only complaint being it sometimes pills if I try to add anything on top of it. Other than that - the texture, the feel, the smell, I love. It is super rich and creamy to touch and feels very moisturizing when you apply to the face. It leaves a bit of shine but you can pat it out when it has dried. The container pumps the perfect amount each time - I use one pump for my face, neck, and ears.

I also have VERY acne prone skin and this has not broken me out. I has almost no acne causing ingredients - the exception being Zinc Oxide and Butylene Glycol which are both only 1 (out of 10) on the acne causing scale [source cosdna]. It has actually improved the quality / texture since adding it to my routine.

150% recommend",5,9,B002MSN3QQ
"I'm surprised this is marketed for acne skin because it is pretty heavy when you first put it on and takes a good 10-15 minutes to absorb. The pro is that there's not a white cast. While I loved the 5% niacinamide in it, the fact it makes my skin oily looking isn't worth it. I'd rather just use a niacinamide serum for that benefit. Also, due to the niacinamide, I can't use vitamin C in the morning. While they can go together, it is recommended to wait 15-20 minutes for the Vit C to absorb before putting on niacinamide. B/t the Vit C absorption and the time it takes for this to fully absorb, that's 25-30 minutes before putting on any makeup. I just don't have that kind of time in the morning.

Also, it's not waterproof, which is fine if you're in the office all day and just sitting in AC. However, I do think it clogs my pores a little if I'm outside more than 15 minutes in the humid summer weather. I will wait till fall/winter to finish this up and go back to finding another lighter sunscreen that doesn't clog my pores for the summer. My hunt for the perfect sunscreen continues.",3,7,B002MSN3QQ
"This is different than any other product I have ever tried. I have hyper-pigmented Asian skin that has always been sensitive to sunscreens. I used to avoid wearing any because I'd break out and then have dark blemishes for months afterwards. I figured it was better to put up with the hyper pigmentation and freckles than to deal with pore clogging sunscreens. But no more! Elta MD absorbs so quickly into the skin and is silky smooth unlike traditional sunscreens that leave a white sheen till it's absorbed. The bottle says the zinc oxide is microionized which might be why it feels so different. I plan on using this product before and after IPL treatment since it hasn't caused any reaction with my skin except make it look more radiant and clear. Highly recommend for acne, sun-damaged, blemished, mid-age skin.",5,20,B002MSN3QQ
"I have acne-prone skin that is very oily but can also be dry and flaky because I use tretinoin cream. I can have dry skin flaking off while my face is still covered in a sheen of oil. Lucky me, right? I prefer to utilize physical sunscreen, so I appreciate that this contains zinc oxide and only one chemical sunscreen. It does not leave a white cast on my face. This sunscreen is not very greasy, as far as sunscreens go. An unexpected bonus that I've discovered is that it actually seems to make my skin less oily during the day, actually better than any primer I've tried. It does not cause me to break out. It is decently moisturizing compared to most other physical sunscreens I've tried. However, during the winter I still need to sometimes add a more heavy duty moisturizer to some flaky areas. I use this as my everyday face sunscreen -- I cannot attest to its quality if used as a beach/sport sunscreen.

-1 star because it is so expensive for such a small amount. But luckily it does last for a while even with daily use.",4,16,B002MSN3QQ
"Either this bottle missed quality control or the it is counterfeit. Granted, I bought it last year (2016) as a backup, and it has been sitting and waiting its turn for a while. However, it isn't yet expired, and it was kept in a pretty cool, dark, and dry cabinet. Yet when I used the cream for the first time last week, both the smell and the color were off -- completely unlike the (many) other bottles of this product I have used. I guess I'll have to go back to the dermatologist to get the real stuff. Very disappointed.",1,19,B002MSN3QQ
"My dermatologist suggested this to me. I have tried tons of sunscreen... TONS, all price points and all brands. I prefer physical blockers but they never mesh with my makeup, make me so greasy (and I'm already oily/combo), or leave a ghostly white cast on my deep brown skin. This absorbs easily, has no strong fragrance, plays well with makeup and moisturize, is still effective is Houston summer heat and humidity, and doesn't trigger my adult acne. I haven't had issues with the pump, I like that I can pump out a lot or a little but. It is not clear - it does leave a slight white cast on my skin, however It does dissipate and I always use at least powder to make my skin more even and absorb the oilies.",5,15,B002MSN3QQ
"This product contains two ingredients we know to be killing the coral reefs. They're found in many sunscreens: Octinoxate, and Oxybenzone. This sunscreen contains the latter. Even if you don't care about the environment (and why not? you do live here!) you probably aren't a fan of hurricanes, tropical storms, and the resulting floods. Coral reefs protect our shoes from erosion, mitigating the damage these storms, storms increasing in frequency and intensity. Please skip this sunscreen, and others containing the ingredients Octinoxate or Oxybenzone.",1,8,B002MSN3QQ
"This product is amazing for sensitive and acne-prone skin. 
I have had issues in the past with sunscreens breaking me out and with Elta MD I have no worries. I have been using it for about a month now per my aesthetician. I have noticed I did go through a purge but that wasn't the only new product I was testing so it could have been a combination of the two. Now after using it a month I have noticed my skin is more hydrated (it does give you a glow) honestly some days I will just put this on and go out the door, it gives you a dewy look. Also, it goes on white but turns clear as you rub it in. I have not seen any white cast after using it. Honestly, it's so amazing you don't even need a primer before makeup, I use one but some days I skip it and there is not much of a difference. This product is worth it and I will cont. to buy it. It also has no smell and the pump on it works amazing and pumps out so smoothly. 10/10",5,5,B002MSN3QQ
"Life changing product. No white cast on bare skin or under foundation and much better results with prescription HYDROQUINONE/retinoid mix. Absolutely no sensation on skin or eyes.
I use warm color foundations in light to medium beige range and get no white cast and use plenty of product.
I noticed a positive change in results of skin lightening in 2 days. IPL and 6% HYDROQUINONE were giving me middling results as I get older. This product is helping me get results I got when I was younger. I have sensitive skin and eyes and have no problems with Elta.
I've used various sunblocks, including LaRoche Posay physical and chemical. ELTA MD is far superior.",5,9,B002MSN3QQ
"After reading hundreds of reviews and trying several different ""sensitive"" face sunscreens, I bit the bullet and decided to try this although it's a little pricey. I'm the type who won't wear sunscreen if it feels as all greasy or heavy, even though I'm fair and know I need to. It just grosses me out. Most that I've tried -- Pür, Sun Bum, Aveeno Sensitive, Super Goop (the original cream formula) -- make me break out in little whiteheads. So I've been on a search for one that I would actually use for quite some time. Here's my take on this one:

- It's fairly smooth and lightweight, and feels fine on my face. But it left my fingers sticky, and if I put it on parts of my body that I touch throughout the day (backs of hands, neck, shoulders, etc.), it leaves a tacky/sticky feeling. Hate it.
- It rubs in well (so no white cast), and has not made me break out at all -- this is fairly impressive.
- The finish is not matte, but gives my face that oily sheen that I hate. No, no, no.
- Worst of all, it is not ""unscented."" I mean, it doesn't have an intentional scent, but it smells vaguely like... a hospital. It's not pleasant. The smell goes away after 20 minutes or so and I can endure, but it's pretty icky at first.

So, I'll use the rest of the bottle because it was expensive and doesn't make my face break out and I'm trying to be a responsible adult and wear my sunscreen, but it's not for me -- will not be re-purchasing.",2,3,B002MSN3QQ
"I bought this and loved using it until I realized that it contained Octinoxate, which is a dangerous ingredient in skincare for women. This ingredient is NOT highlighted on the product information area on this site and only shows it on the bottle listed on the back. I will no longer be using this product, unfortunately. I wish more people knew about this dangerous ingredient, especially when it is in a product that we use on our skin DAILY for protection. Please change your product information so that this ingredient is mentioned! Please consider changing your formula so that it can be a better product.",1,5,B002MSN3QQ
"Was wary because of reviews saying the product would not be authentic, but did some research and saw that EltaMD does have Amazon as an authorized seller now. I received an authentic product in February 2019. As for the sunblock itself, it feels nice! It has a more greasy feel going on than the Asian milky ones like Biore, so it feels moisturizing, but the greasiness goes away after rubbing into the skin, unlike Neutrogena. No scent and no white cast even though it's a physical sunscreen!",5,8,B002MSN3QQ
"I can't bash this product completely because it may be very effective for someone else. I've had a sensitivity to sunscreens for the last two years or so. The only brand that hasn't left me with blotchy, rashy skin is my Cera Ve with InvisibleZinc - but if you've used it before then you know that if you use a ""liberal"" amount... you still end up looking a bit dead or like a wanna-be clown. I had high hope for this sunscreen. ""UV Clear"" and ""Safe for sensitive skin and rosacea."" I received it in the morning, washed, moisturized, applied this sunscreen and went about my day. By bedtime, I noticed a bit of blotchiness and a slight itch. When I woke up in the morning my face was beet-red, slightly puffy, hot, burning/tingling and itchy as all hell. I look and feel like I have a sunburn.
SO - unfortunately not for me. As I write this I'm contemplating putting an ice pack on my face... UPDATE: I did read more about one of Elta's active ingredients, Octinoxate and some of the adverse reactions are contact dermatitis, rash, dry skin, inflammation... blah blah blah... My reaction was quite severe. If you happen to have sensitive skin be careful. I guess it's back to Cera Ve and the half-dead look for me (laughing).",1,3,B002MSN3QQ
"Pros: NO white cast, not greasy at all. It dries down completely and leaves you with a shine/glow, but not greasy or oily.
Cons: It stings a little for me, perhaps it's the niacinamide or lactic acid. When I first put it on I get really red, then it goes away. I also got a few little pimples the first week I used it. I also had some dryness and tightness for about a week, then my skin adjusted to the lighter formula.
I have been using EltaMD sunscreens exclusively this summer and have ultimately been disappointed. This one especially because it's so expensive. I do not burn or come even close when I use this brand, but it did not save me from getting new freckles. Maybe that means the UVB protection is superior to the UVA? Bottom line I don't think this is worth the price.",3,8,B002MSN3QQ
"Contains mineral sunblock & chemical sunscreen. The info. on the benefits & limitations of mineral vs. chemical sunscreens is VERY confusing. Consumer Reports recommends chemical sunscreens as they test better for skin protection. CR has taken the opinion that most of the chemicals approved in the U.S, for sunscreens, are completely safe. However, many of these ingredients aren’t approved in other countries because of safety concerns. And, ironically, two of the most effective sunscreen ingredients aren’t even available in the U.S. A result of politics & corporate greed. Some studies show that the most popular chemicals used in U.S. sunscreens can dangerously change healthy human hormone levels. And some ingredients may, in theory, be carcinogenic!

So, the EWG(I think those are the correct initials?) a health & environment safety group only recommends mineral( titanium & zinc) physical sun blocks. But, EWG focuses on safe ingredients much more than how well skin is protected from the suns rays. As long as a product states that it provides broad spectrum uva & uvb protection with an spf of 30 or above and it relies on mineral blocks,...EWG seems to approve. Every dermatologist I’ve seen also recommends broad spectrum mineral sun blocks!?!

Elta has a great reputation with most dermatologists. It IS rather pricey though. This particular elta product combines zinc & octinoxate. Perhaps the best of both worlds?
It doesn’t leave a white cast like pure mineral sunscreens do!! Plus it contains niacinamide for skin health. However, the zinc in this product is micronized. This makes it transparent. A quick internet search will show that micronized zinc is controversial too!! Some science shows it to be unsafe!

All of this conflicting info could make people throw their hands up and just forget sunscreen all together. I’ve decided to use brands, like Elta md., that my dermatologist approves of—but doesn’t sell. A combo of one chemical & one mineral(actually a chemical itself) that’s broad spectrum, spf 46 & doesn’t make me white or irritate my skin, is what I’m going with. Life is too short to obsess over sunscreen.",4,4,B002MSN3QQ
"I have sensitive oily skin and hormonal acne. I am a brown-skinned black woman and this facial sunscreen is a godsend! It’s so hard for women with brown skin to find a sunscreen that won’t leave a whitecast or turn us grey! And the tinted ones are never our color tint. Along with my particular skin issues I thought I’d never find a good sunscreen but this product is the answer. Now that I’ve used it for a few months I can see that it does improve the quality of my skin and it seems to be reducing my blemishes slightly too though I can’t be completely sure of the latter only because I use other products to lighten blemishes as well. I use my regular moisturizer under this product and I’ve never used it alone so I can’t say whether or not it moisturizes particularly well, but like I said, I have oily skin so it’d be hard to tell if it didn’t. This product has never irritated my skin or been problematic in any way. It has a lovely, very light clean smell that reminds me of baby products. This will now be a regular staple in my skincare regime.",5,3,B002MSN3QQ
"Overall is good.

Pros: Is light weight, it absorbs fast, no white cast, you only needs a small amount, is mattifying but not drying, it is fine under makeup.

Cons: If you apply other mattifying products before the sunscreen it will peel off AWFUL. For example I always do my skincare routine with 3 drops of niacinamide 10% from the ordinary + 1 pump of mattifying hydrator from Dr. Brandt then sun protection, and with EltaMD UV Clear Facial Sunscreen all the products peel off as soon as the sunscreen dries.
I tried to prevent this by:
1.- Reducing the amount of previous products I put on, it didn't work.
2.- Waiting more time between layer to let them dry better. Didn't work.
3.- Using only the sunscreen. It worked
4.- Not using other mattifying products. It worked.

So the product is good but it has a texture issue with other mattifying products.
Another cons, for me, is that 1 pump is a lot of product, I only user half a pump, is more that enough.

I will continue using this product but I don't think I will buy it again. I will continue my search of the perfect sunscreen for me.",4,3,B002MSN3QQ
I originally bought an Origins moisturizer with sunscreen bc the other moisturizers I use currently (Ponds and Belif) don't have any SPF. The Origins brand made me break out if I used it more than 1 day. Living in South Florida and coming up on pool season (hopefully soon post-COVID) I knew I needed to try another brand. I had a few friends recommend EltaMD and the reviews online were promising for combination or sensitive skin. I tend to fluctuate from oily to dry and if I put too much products on my face interchangeably it usually responds with a breakout. I have used this four days in a row now and have not had any adverse reactions. I would recommend trying for those who have had bad luck with other brands. The price point alone is attractive as some other brands I had recommended were over $60 for the same or smaller portions.,4,3,B002MSN3QQ
"Just when I found the perfect tinted daily sunscreen, Elta MD tinted, along came Covid and face masks. The tint is great but there is no way to wear it with a mask and not end up with stains on the inside. So, I tried the Elta MD UV Clear, SPF 46. Perfection! For some reason, anything with zinc oxide stays on the surface of my skin making me look as white as Morticia Adams. Somehow, Elta MD has found a way to provide great protection that is truly clear. And it isn't greasy. Other sunscreens leave your hands so oily it's hard to open bottles or insert contact lenses, even after washing your hands. I love this product! When we are free from masks again, I will also use the tinted. But the clear is fabulous. I highly recommend it.",5,2,B002MSN3QQ
"I previously purchased this about a year ago and I feel like I received a counterfeit product.

A couple weeks ago, I repurchased. I've used it every day since and my skin had no negative reactions. This sunscreen does not pill or irritate my acne prone/redness prone skin. It did sting a bit for the first couple days but not anymore.

I do not think it clogs my pores as much as other sunscreens. I really love this product. I have no deal complaints at all!

I highly recommend this if you're acne prone and oily. It's probably the best for humid environments but this is a solid sunscreen. I'm rating it a 9 out of 10. I don't think I've ever loved another sunscreen this much.",5,4,B002MSN3QQ
"In my 30s, I have decided to wear sunscreen everyday and I wanted a natural product that is gentle to be used that way. I was fool by this so called ""mineral"" sunscreen with raving reviews. This contains chemical ingredient and thats why there is no white cast. And the ranking on EWG is at 6!!! immediately after open I smell the strong chemical sunscreen scent. all day my face was oil but it made my face felt tender and irritated. this might be good if you are seeking a just no white cast sunscreen to use once a while. this is no way good for using everyday as the ingredients are way to toxic.",1,5,B002MSN3QQ
"This is my second go at Elta/MD Clear Facial sunscreen. The first bottle (several months ago) I used and dumped the rest in the trash. Now, my second go at it with another bottle and I'm starting to get that itch of -- 'throw the whole thing away'. For a guy with brown skin and who uses Retin-A gel, this Elta/MD Clear, DOES leave a white cast, ESPECIALLY IF you apply it twice in a day, without washing your face to remove the first application. My look...... my face..... well, it will send you screaming with night sweat. I guess, for color people, it's okay to wear around the house and that's about it. I also find it to be a bit drying, if applied alone. I'm NOT sure what the raves and hypes are all about. I believe Clinique's mineral sunscreen are better than this one, at least when applied over my face lotion.",2,4,B002MSN3QQ
"I've been using the elta md clear UV lotion for the past 5 years using this seller but I had to return the item this time. The product was not the same. It was thicker, no fresh cooling effects I when applied. It felt like a regular store bought cheap UV cream. It never questioned on authenticity of products from this seller until now. I better purchase through a physician' office.",1,13,B002MSN3QQ
I grew up in South Florida and lived in the Florida Keys and spent most of my life in the sun. I never used sunscreen on my face. At 66 years of age I decided it was time to have a sunscreen on my face. My dermatologist recommended this one. I use it every day now over top of my moisturizer. It took a while but my skin looks so much more amazing and healthy now. I would not go out in the sun without it on. It makes a huge difference. It’s a little pricey for most people but this little bottle last a really long time. You don’t need much. I put little dots all over my face it is very moisturizing and spreads easily,5,2,B002MSN3QQ
"I bought this mostly because Curology recommended it and it didn't cost $50+ per bottle. I was previously using Sun Bum SPF 30, which worked pretty well for me overall.

Anyway, getting into EltaMD's SPF 46 (such a random number!) for faces...

Did it have a strange smell? Yes, but as long as you're not getting super intimate with people, nobody is going to notice the smell. It's not that strong smelling.

Does it leave a slight white shadow on my face? Yes, but overall, it absorbs pretty well for being SPF 46. Again, usually I use 30 or even as low as 15.

When I sweat, does it burn my eyes any more than how much my own perspiration burns my eyes when I sweat? NO!!!

Does it prevent sunburn on a very sunny day in August in Florida? YES!!!!

Has it caused my acne prone skin to break out? NO!!!

Those last 3 statements are the reasons why I give this product a 5 star review. Works just as well if not better than Sun Bum, and burns my eyes less than Sun Bum.",5,2,B002MSN3QQ
"I may be the weirdo here, but I really don't like this product, as many times as I've tried to love it. It's too shiny, it almost leaves a ""plastic"" film, and it tends to feel gritty and ball (you cannot put on multiple layers of this product). I do like the high protection and ingredients, just can't stand the texture. I honestly prefer the ""new and improved"" Coppertone Faces Clear Zinc SPF 50 much better...similar ingredients (zinc/chemical combo), just for me, much creamier in texture and plays better with my makeup! I've tried the Elta MD over my Cerave PM, over Obagi Hydrate, alone, under different makeup and no matter what I do, I don't like.

Sorry to throw a wrench in the positive reviews here!",3,8,B002MSN3QQ
"This product has such incredible reviews and it's recommended by so many people, but it didn't work for me. I tried it multiple times and every time, I got tiny little pimples that popped up later that day and sometimes the next day. I waited for the pimples to go away and gave it another try, same thing happened. Also, the consistency is pretty awful in my opinion. It pilled so badly on my face. I would apply my moisturizer and wait a few minutes for it to soak into my skin. Then I would go in with the sunscreen. It's extremely white and took a lot of rubbing to blend into my skin. Then it just would pill at the edges of my face. It's worse when I reapplied (since you have to apply sunscreen every two hours). I just had pills/globs of sunscreen all over that wouldn't bled in. It was so icky.",2,2,B002MSN3QQ
"I am a very fair-skinned individual, and have tried numerous sunscreens over the years. After hearing so much about Elta, I decided to give it a try. It may act as a great sunscreen, but that is completely overshadowed by how badly this pills up on skin. I have tried using different moisturizers underneath, to using no moisturizer, but no matter what, this pills up. I end up having to rub my face to get all the pilled-up product off, and then apply a different sunscreen afterwards. So disappointing. Definitely not worth the money, and Biore and LaRoche-Posay offer better and more affordable sunscreens that don't pill.",1,2,B002MSN3QQ
"I adore this sunscreen... defo in my top 3. I wear spf 365 days per year from sun up to sun down. Rain or shine, winter or summer. I also reapply during day. This ran dry exactly one month after I purchased it. I do not reapply using the same; I have many awesome sunscreens in the rotation (2 other faves are biore aqua rich & supergoop superscreen). This still ran out sooo quick. I will buy again though. I am 41, normal skin, like when sunscreens are absorbed into nothing feeling or looking, don’t make me shiny (or less common, dry me out) and of course offer amazing sun protection!",5,2,B002MSN3QQ
"I think this is kind of pricy for sunscreen and was hesitant but it's AMAZING. Since starting on a new face medication, my dermatologist wouldn't stopped recommending that I wear sunscreen regularly. I really hate the smell of sunscreen, the white sheen it always leaves, and it always ends up breaking me out, even if they say they're made for acne-prone skin.

This is the first sunscreen I have ever bought that
1. Smells amazing
2. Doesn't break me out
3. Doesn't leave a white sheen on my face",5,10,B002MSN3QQ
"I really thought this product would be a winner...especially when I heard reviews from African American women like me saying that it didn’t leave a white cast etc. Unfortunately, this product made my skin itch sooo much! I didn’t know if it was the sunscreen or another makeup product that was giving me that reaction so I tried wearing it again with no makeup and my face was on fire! I just kept scratching and scratching. I eventually had to just use some makeup wipes I keep in my work bag to clean the product off my face. Really wish it worked for me, but issa NO! Btw, I’m not someone who has sensitive skin! No allergies, nothing...but I believe it’s the Octinoxate that my skin doesn’t agree with. I switched over to Pure & Simple Coppertone for Face and it seems to be fine (only has zinc oxide as active ingredient).",1,2,B002MSN3QQ
"This is a solid sunscreen, but unfortunately it does not work well with my other skin care/make up routine. I use Fresh deep hydration cream first and then apply Elta MD UV clear. It pills a little bit around my forehead. Then I apply Bare Mineral rescue complexion, and my forehead pills even more. I think most of the products have rolled off. I've tried waiting in between applications but still no avail. I am still on the lookout for a good sunscreen.

EltaMD does not cause whiteheads on my skin. It's transparent. It does not cause increase sebum/oil production. But it pills with my other products.",3,4,B002MSN3QQ
"I find this to be quite expensive for the price. It's such a small bottle and the pump makes it great for travel/keeping it in your bag, but it is so expensive!!! I also find it to leave an ugly cast despite it being the ""Clear"" version. It's not as bad as other sunscreens, but it is so not worth the price. Several other sunscreens, American and Asian, do a better job.",3,4,B002MSN3QQ
I had really high expectations about this product. It advertises that it’s good for skin with rosacea. Last Saturday was the first time I put it on and inmediately my skin had a reaction. I didn’t think it was the product so the day after I put it back again and my face turned bright red. Monday I woke up with brakeouts and my skin was so sensitive. I am not sure if this product conflicted with my face treatments I follow for my condition but have to say I has made my skin worse. I hope is not your case but please if you buying this be very careful and just put some in a section of your skin first before you try it in your entire face. You don’t want it to react bad like mine did.,1,4,B002MSN3QQ
"There's many reviews saying that this is a fake product but I emailed Elta MD and they said as of 2017, Amazon is an authorized retailer and If purchased through Amazon it should say ""Ships from and sold by Amazon"" or Amazon Services LLC.

Just be on the lookout for third party Amazon resellers where it might say for example ""Sold By: Skincare World"". These are the Amazon resellers that are not authorized.

As for my review I just bought it so I will update this once I have tested it out. just giving this five stars in hopes that others will see this.",5,3,B002MSN3QQ
"I would have this product buried with me. I SWEAR by this and Elta Daily.
I have dry skin that likes to peel if I’m not on my moisturizer game while living in the desert. On days I’m really dry I use UV Daily. On days when I have a pimple or feel my skin is congested, I use this UV Clear.

If you’re trying to decide which you want, UV Daily is a MOISTURE BOMB. Not thick and gross, but definitely creamy.

UV Clear moisturizes, but I find it soaks in and leaves a semi-matte finish. Sometimes I layer a different cream over it if I want the skin clearing benefits, but an added emollient.

I recommend this HIGHLY to anyone who can’t find a sunscreen that doesn’t break them out. It never seems to leave a white cast (though I am quite pale) and it’s certainly never CAUSED a zit.",5,One,B002MSN3QQ
I have been using Elta’s UV Physical tinted sunscreen for years and love it but I wanted an un-tinted sunscreen for days when I go completely make up free. UV Clear gets glowing reviews so I thought I’d give it a try. I was confident I’d like it since I use Elta’s tinted sunscreen. Wrong. This product almost felt like it was stinging my skin and left my face feeling sticky and stiff. I’ll keep trying to see if perhaps it’s better with different moisturizers but at this point I probably won’t purchase this again. My skin leans toward being sensitive and it could be the chemical sunscreen in the product is not good with my skin. The Elta tinted sunscreen relies on zinc and titanium dioxide so is 100% mineral based.,3,One,B002MSN3QQ
"Short review: Great for sensitive skin and does not clogs my pores. Pump once, a little bit of product goes a long way. No greasy residue on me. Worth the money. Wish it was cruelty free though. Does not moisturize much but does not dry out either. Helps a bit with oily areas in face like t-zone.

Long review:
I was recommended this product by my friend who struggles with acne-prone skin. I don’t struggle as much with acne as I do with just sensitive skin in general, but she said this would be great for that too and I’m glad I listened. I spent so much time doing research and trying to find a more affordable one that would work for my skin and after trying some, they would all make me break out or turn my skin red. I finally caved and purchased this sunscreen and although I wish it was cruelty free, I can say that it is worth the money. After wearing it for two months, I can see a difference in my skin complexion. My pores do not clog like they did with other facial spf and doesn’t leave a sticky or greasy residue. I will say though that a little goes a long way so careful when you pump, not to pump too much or it will go to waste. Learned that the hard way. Also, I have dry skin for the most part and it doesn’t moisturize it much for me but doesn’t dry it out either. I apply my usual moisturizer then the sunscreen. The sunscreen has oil-absorbing ingredients that help me around my chin, my pinky oily area since I have to wear a mask for work all day and been breaking out around my chin as a result. Overall, I would recommend. It’s like the perfect mix for people with dry and oily skin, it’s crazy how good it works for both skin types, and unless I find a cheaper sunscreen that works as good or better than this, I won’t be switching any time soon.",5,One,B002MSN3QQ
"I’m not one to write reviews but I’ve been telling myself ever since I bought this sunscreen, I must write one. Let me start off by saying I have sensitive skin that is easily prone to hyperpigmentation/ rosacea. Also, I’ve always dreaded and (unfortunately, avoided) putting sunscreen on my face my whole life. I hated how much greasier my already greasy skin looked. I disliked the smell, how it felt, everything. Fast forward to using this sunscreen and I ACTUALLY LOOK FORWARD TO PUTTING IT ON. I’ve even applied it on days I don’t plan to go outside because of how moisturizering it is, my skin comes alive when I apply it. There’s no strong smell, I sometimes have allergic reactions to perfume-y smells. It’s not greasy. DOESN’T leave your face white like other sunscreens ( very confused by any comments which say it does). I swear it makes my skin look good once I apply it, plump and more even toned skin, this stuff is magic (who agrees?!) It’s summer so when I ran out and was waiting for my order I noticed my skin was getting back to what it used be before I discovered this - hyperpigmented due to the sun. So now I know for sure this sunscreen is why my skin has looked better than any past summers. Because of all the pros, I do not mind paying this much for sunscreen. I’m a product lover, I enjoy researching the best products for everything and try many until I find The One and this right here is one of my all time favorite products I own.",5,3,B002MSN3QQ
"As a longtime Elta MD user, I can say the product I received is the real deal.
My bottle arrived in a sealed box that had the batch# and Expiration date on the bottom. The bottle has the correct nozzle top as well as the batch# and expiration date on the bottom.
The UV clear (both tinted & clear) is my ride or die MUST HAVE daily moisturizer. I love that it does so beautifully under makeup that it can truly double as a primer! That was a fabulous tip I received from my esthetician who is also a makeup artist. This stuff is loaded with antioxidants & other skin-loving ingredients.
Elta MD UV- Clear is worth every penny!!!!",5,One,B002MSN3QQ
"This was a recommendation on a website as a good SPF moisturizer that doesn’t clog your pores. I didn’t really read too much about it, just ordered it and started slapping it on. It’s not super thick and does make my skin a little shiny at first, although not as bad as others do. After a couple days, my skin started clearing up and my first thought was that I should have started using SPF years ago if this was the result of blocking UV rays! Then I saw it had niacinamide in it, haha. Well, it works! I’ve tried other niacinamide products before and none of them have given me the results that this SPF moisturizer does. It’s on the pricier side, but I have no problems shelling out for it as long as this is the result...especially since my skin hadn’t been doing so great with all the extra mask wearing.",5,One,B002MSN3QQ
"After watching a TikTok from @whatsonvisface she recommended this product. I decided to try it because her skin is amazing. I was hesitant about the price at first because I'm cheap. I think it will last me 4-6 months of one time daily use honestly. I have combination skin. I can apply this immediately after my shower and it absorbs within 5 minutes. I usually get oily halfway through the day with most products, however I can go ALL DAY without my T-zone becoming oily with this! It spreads like freaking butter! The amount shown on my fingers can easily be used on my face and neck. The smell isn't overbearing like most sunscreens. I had issues with other sunscreens melting into my eyes and burning but haven't had any issues with this one yet. Doesn't make my face shiny AT ALL or feel sticky EVER. I will be buying this from now on unless I get a better one for free! lol

These are the sunscreens I've tried - Neutrogena Hydro Boost City Shield SPF 25, Neutrogena Clear Face sunscreen lotion SPF 55 oil-free and there was another generic kind from Walmart. Hydro Boost was expensive for how much I had to use. Clear face made my face oily all day.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"Mostly, this is a great sunscreen. It is both physical and chemical, but it goes on clear and smooth. It has Niacinamide in it, which is great for skin, but the chemical it uses as sunscreen, Octinoxate, is terrible for the skin and causes premature aging. This is why it contains Niacinamide as well, to hopefully counteract the negative impact of Octinoxate, and possibly even have positive results. However, this has not been proven to work in lab tests. So I can't give it 5 stars because there is no way to know for sure if this is having a net positive or negative result on my skin, besides protecting me from the sun (which it does very well).",4,5,B002MSN3QQ
"I’m obsessed with skincare products, especially trying new sunscreens for my face. I’ve tried many, many face sunscreens, and the EltaMD UV Clear Facial Sunscreen is the best one I’ve ever used.

It’s great for sensitive skin, and contains only FA-safe ingredients, if that’s a concern for you. It’s moisturizing and contains niacinamide, which is great for brightening skin and improving overall texture/evenness. It doesn’t sit too heavy on your face either, so you can apply makeup over it without any issues. Absolutely no pilling either, unless
you’re applying it over a thicker serum, like niacinamide, but any sunscreen would pill over niacinamide. It layers beautifully over my morning vitamin C serum.

I’m literally only ever buying this face sunscreen in the future. It’s a little pricy, but it has high SPF protection (SPF 46 should block at least 97% of UVA/UVB rays) and is so comfortable on my face that I forget it’s there. I recommend this to anyone, but especially people with sensitive skin!",5,One,B002MSN3QQ
"I would give it zero if I could. This product was mentioned in a few blog posts as recommended by dermatologists daily and the bottle even says for acne prone and rosacea prone skin. And there are so many glowing reviews.

I thought it would be great for my sensitive skin. Within 12 hours of first application I had a mild rash, within 24 hours I had a full on reaction all over my face and neck. Red raised bumps all over and itching.

This may be a great product for some but something in it set my skin off in a way nothing ever has. So if your skin is sensitive don’t make my same mistake... test this product first on a small patch before slathering over your whole face.",1,4,B002MSN3QQ
"(The flakiness/peeling in the pictures was a very mild example. It has been much worse before)
This sunscreen has good protection. It didn't cause any skin reactions in me and I normally have sensitive skin, so this product would be good in that department. For appearances, it would probably be fine on a casual and laid-back day, IF/WHEN you can get it to actually blend well enough to sit on the skin properly... I've had days where it works good, and enhances my skin. But sadly, that's a rarity.
Most days, I have a lot of trouble out of it. It is horrible under makeup. It also drys too fast. It drys before I even get it blended in and then will start to peel and flake all over the skin. I've had to completely rewash my face and redo my entire routine after using this sunscreen. The flakiness is everywhere!
I've even had people comment on the flakes near my hairline because it's so horrible that it ends up all in the front of my hair like dandruff.
I ended up purchasing this twice (thinking maybe I got a bad batch, etc).
Needless to say, I decided to just buy a different SPF. This is now my ""last resort/backup"" SPF just in case my other runs out.",2,One,B002MSN3QQ
"Love this sunscreen! Bought it last June 2019 at a dermatology office after trying my cousin's bottle. I used almost every day since then on face, neck, upper chest & ears and it lasted til 2 months ago. Bought current bottle on Amazon & it works just as well. I am very oily skinned and this doesnt make me too much oilier. I love that even though it says its not water resistant, I can put it on & go out for the day & even jogging and still not get burned. (I nornally burn very easily and have had 2 skin cancers surgically removed in the past). It has just enough white tone to it to tone down my reddish colored skin tone, which I like, because normally I wear a light foundation to tone down the red. The texture is an easy-to-spread lotion unlike some of the thick zinc sunscreens.",5,One,B002MSN3QQ
"I have been using this sunscreen for years as recommended by my derm. However, the most recent bottle I purchased from amazon is fake. I went to the beach yesterday where my face was badly sunburned, despite reapplying many times. Amazon does not verify the authenticity of their products and is not an authorized reseller of Elta MD. Counterfeit beauty products are a major problem on this website. From now on I will purchase either from my dermatologist or directly from the Elta MD website only, and I recommend that you do the same.",1,3,B002MSN3QQ
"I have purchased this sunscreen many times before. I recently read the list of sunscreen ingredients to avoid and this one contains one: octinoxate. So, for a while I tried some purely mineral sunscreens but they felt too heavy so I thought I would come back to this one because I love the weight and the texture--and read that the very small amounts of octinoxate contained in the sunscreen MAY not be problematic anyway. With this last purchase, however, my skin broke out immediately, and worse than when I was a teenager (I'm 53). It was just awful. I don't know if there's something wrong with this particular one but I've never had a problem with this kind of Elta sunscreen before. I'm sadly sending it back.",1,One,B002MSN3QQ
"I LOVE this sunscreen. To begin with I'm a sunscreen feen, I apply twice a day, sometimes even three if I can. I've tried so many and this one is my favorite. Unfortunately, I bought the clear kind instead of the tinted. The tinted blends into the skin so beautifully and gives a really pretty dewy look. The clear sunscreen leaves a strong white cast. Since I do re-apply often, the white cast becomes very obvious on my olive skin. It also becomes flakey by the end of the day so I have white flakes all over my face. I've never noticed any flakes with the tinted version. Once I finish this bottle I will triple check that I order the correct version.",3,5,B002MSN3QQ
I loveeeee this sunscreen. It's my favorite. I've been using this for almost a year and have gone through multiple bottles. It is superior to any other brand I've tried (Supergoop included). I even wear it when I'm not sure if I'll be going outside because it's just a natural step in my routine now. I use it after vitamin C serum and it's the perfect amount of moisturizer - it's great under makeup or alone. I have combination skin and this does not break me out. I like this better than the Unseen Sunscreen by Supergoop which feels more like a silicon base (feels a lot like a makeup primer).,5,2,B002MSN3QQ
"I honestly really liked this stuff because it’s not oily at all and made my face feel great but after only 2 days of usage I broke out in a rash all over my face. I originally thought the sunscreen just didn’t work very well because my face was red, but I did not get sunburnt, just a rash. I don’t have sensitive skin whatsoever and have NEVER gotten any type of rash on my face nor my body. Hoping I’ll somehow be able to get my money back since I only used twice and broke out. :(",1,8,B002MSN3QQ
"This says it is a mineral sunscreen, but in fact it contains 7.5% Octinoxate. (See photo.) If you, like me, are trying to buy mineral sunscreens (zinc oxide, titanium dioxide) to avoid chemicals that can be absorbed through your skin, then do not buy!

(This product does feel amazing on your skin and doesn't leave a white residue...but that's because it's actually partially a chemical sunscreen, not a mineral one. There are plenty of chemical sunscreens that feel nice on your skin.)",1,3,B002MSN3QQ
"Best sunscreen I’ve ever used on my face!! I typically get so broken out from wearing sunscreen on my face. Small under the skin bumps, random giant bumps, you name it, I’d get it. I’ve tried all sorts of brands. I just spent 7 days at the beach applying this 2 or 3 times a day and I’ve had absolutely no breakouts. It doesn’t feel heavy or oily. I absolutely love it!!",5,4,B002MSN3QQ
"I'm a fair skinned lady& didn't notice any ""white tint"" left behind. Skin cancers run in my family, so everyday sunscreen is a must. This is by far the one I like the most. My dermatologist recommended it initially, but I ran from the price and found some by a cheaper brand& just suffered through the ever greasy feeling of protection. I finally bit the bullet& bought it..... can I just say, it's the best?? Hands down, best product ever. No break outs, no greasy feeling or white tint left behind. I use as much as moisturizer, about 20 min before going iut&it's amazing, I don't even feel like I'm wearing it. If you make this purchase, you will not regret it.",5,One,B002MSN3QQ
"After years and years of trial and error with many brands, I can finally say I have found a product that does not make my face break out. I have very sensitive skin and im very alergic to any type of fragrance. I dont know how long this bottle will last but with one pump is more than enough per application. I am very pleased with this product. I know it’s pricey but trust me is worth every penny.",5,2,B002MSN3QQ
"If you have eczema, sensitive skin, use chemical peels and/or use prescription topical acne/wrinkle creams —this Product is likely Not for you.
If you can tolerate the few minute long burning, you will probably find it not be gentle enough to use daily. (After the initial burn) It does provide a nice sheen & works well under makeup or alone.
I'm going to use this sparingly even though this product requires more re-applications.
A more mineral physical barrier/thicker non irritating, no odd ingredients sunscreen (Totlogic) requiring less reapplication works better for my sensitive skin despite it can cast a bit of a lighter skin shade (fades).",2,One,B002MSN3QQ
"I bought this after watching recommendations and reviews from Dr. Dray, a board-certified Dermatologist on YouTube. I purchase many of the products she talks about; however, for the price, I was a little hesitant about this product.

I’m glad to say I’m completely blown away and will be purchasing more! While the size may not “look” the most impressive, the ingredients in it, including mineral sunscreens, are perfect for blocking BOTH UVA AND UVB. I commute to work and while the windshield of the car may block one of the two, it does not block the non burning, AGING UV rays. I apply this every morning after my morning facial routine which includes Tretinoin 0.1%. Tretinoin is a vitamin A derivative and is hundreds times stronger than retinol, such as from Olay, L’Oréal, etc. and is FDA APPROVED for anti-aging. The caveat is it makes your skin extremely sensitive to the sun and sunburn.

This sunscreen alone is moisturizing and provides great coverage for me. It is not nearly as pasty white as other sunscreens and creates a bit of a “primer” effect by blurring pores and giving your skin a bright, not white, appearance. Occasionally I’ll add a pure mineral sunscreen under my eyes for further protection and help with any dark circles (I’m a night shift Registered Nurse and work 3 12hr shifts in a row) and let it sit while I drive and then rub it into the rest of my face. I have not experienced any breakouts or issues with this product and one pump of the container is more than enough for your face; however, two pumps is perfect for my face, décolleté, and hands as I commute to the hospital.

When I am close to running out I will most definitely order more as it seems to last much longer than expected and works as a great moisturizer (all sunscreens are moisturizers really...), sunscreen, and primer.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"My dermatologist recommended this sunscreen to me - I have some sun damage (I admit, I haven't been very diligent with sunscreen - ever), and she explained to me that a sunscreen that protects against UVB rays is what is going to prevent sun damage/aging. Most sunscreens that you buy at the drugstore have either only UVA protection, or very little UVB protect. This product has a very high level of UVB protection, so she recommends it to prevent further sun damage - aka brown spots. I decided to try it and I love the consistency. I love that it is good for acne prone skin, so it doesn't make me oily or break out. I've been using a prescription bleaching cream to get rid of the current brown spots, along with this sunscreen, on a daily basis. My skin looks better than its ever looked before. I will continue using this sunscreen to make sure my skin stay looking this good.",5,2,B002MSN3QQ
"Absolutely love it.
I have melasma and every single morning after I brush my teeth I need to cover my face with sunscreen. This product is the only one (of the thousand different sunscreens I have tried) that actually doesn’t make my skin to break out, doesn’t give me oily look and I can see the protection (my sun spots are remaining the same)!
I like the product so much that I ordered and the tinted version (which I didn’t like and don’t recommend), as well as the Face cleanser and eye cream. Well, Elta’s superstar is definitely this sunscreen. It’s my absolute favorite product so far and I don’t intend to switch or even try anything else in the foreseeable future!",5,One,B002MSN3QQ
"If you suffer from rosacea and break out with typical sunscreens when you are in the sun, this is the product for you. My dermatologist gave me a sample and I loved it and ordered a bottle from Amazon. It's the only sunscreen I have been able to use without breaking out, and I live in SC where the sun shines nearly daily. It's light, goes on easily, and doesn't take much more than a dab to cover the acne prone areas of my face. It's expensive, but you only need a little, and to not break out, it's worth the price. It is basically zinc oxide (the old white stuff that life guards used), so it blocks out a lot of sun. Highly recommend. I've bought one extra bottle for my travel bag to make sure I'm never without it. I cover the rest of my body with an SPF 30 and use this only on my face.",5,2,B002MSN3QQ
"Im a young adult female with skin prone to hormonal acne, and this is my go-to daily moisturizer & sunscreen. I’ve re-ordered 3 times in the past 1 year (aka this bottle lasts me about 4 months AND I keep going back to this product). The niacinamide and zinc keep my breakouts under control and are so smoothing. I use this product every day for sun protection paired with just the right amount of hydration for my oily, acne-prone skin.",5,3,B002MSN3QQ
"It makes my face oily, especially after about an hour. I wouldn’t recommend this if your main concern is oiliness.

It moisturizes okay, but I ended up having to put moisturizer underneath because it doesn’t help to moisturize the dry spots that I get on my skin from acne.
I would recommend using a SMALL amount of lightweight moisturizer underneath if you have dry skin issues too. I use la Roche posay matte face moisturizer because it does not make my face oily at all.

There is no strong sunscreen smell that a lot of SPFs have.
Overall, I like it more than the previous SPF moisturizers I’ve used, but I don’t think I’ll buy again when I use this up.",4,One,B002MSN3QQ
"Although this has a very light texture, like a whipped, airy cream, it made me break out. It seemed to not last long, and you need to reapply multiple times throughout the day.
Pros: helped reduce redness around my nose and mouth; light, non-oily texture (seems a little too light though, so I reapplied quite often). I have dry skin, with an oily T-zone, but this did not make me more oily than usual.
Cons: made me breakout, not with full-blown acne, but more of all-over bumpy skin as if it was a rash/acne that wanted to show itself. I used the product for a month, hoping my skin would get used to it. My skin texture/breakouts only improved when I stopped using the product, after 2 days.
Overall, was looking for a substitute to my Shiseido that I have been using for over a decade. Unfortunately, this didn't cut it, so I am back to Shiseido, unless I can find a good/natural sunscreen.",2,6,B002MSN3QQ
"I bought this because of the great reviews and I’m trying to find a face sunscreen that works well with my skin type. I like the product, but I think this item I received might be old? I put it on and it’s clear and doesn’t have the SPF smell, which is great, but when the lotion dries, it leaves little white crusties on my face (looks like eraser dust). Is this product I received old? Can it be replaced?",1,3,B002MSN3QQ
"Worth EVERY penny ! I usually don’t spend so much on a “sunscreen .” I’m so glad I made the investment and in the long run it turns out I’m really saving money . This is the absolute best product for my sensitive, “ aging” skin. I’m in my middle 50’s . I had melanoma a few years ago & so I take my sunscreen seriously . I also try to hang on to a youthful appearance as long as I can so keeping up with a vigilant skincare routine for my face is important . This is a great product that takes care of a few steps at once. It moisturizes , protects and heals sensitive skin, plus it’s transparent ... excellent for those who have medium toned skin color & wear make up. This is great to wear under your best foundation ! I have tried countless products that leave that horrible cast making me look gray or ashy . This DOES NOT !",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I am undergoing treatment for skin issues similar to melasma and I have to watch the sun. Problem is (1) I HATE oily or heavy sunscreens, (2) I prefer a block but without a white cast and (3) I hate scented crap.

This stuff works great! I’ve been under treatment for some time but using La Roche Posey which is ok
It is a little greasy on me and leaves a DEFINITE white cast.

So after about six months I opted to try this as physicians I know swear by this line.

It isn’t heavy. It isn’t oily. It goes on white but once rubbed in disappears and leaves a healthy not greasy glow. I wish it was waterproof as I swim daily, but I use their chemical one for that hour.

IMO if you’ve tried all the “dry block” type sunscreens and hates them, this might work for you too.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I bought this because it was recommended for acne prone skin, however after a single day of using it as directed I have been left with the worst sunburnt face I have ever had. I rather have acne than this sunburn. I had previously been using a very expensive face sunscreen with SPF 30 but would get breakouts after using it so I did some research and read about this one that was supposedly good for acne prone skin. I thought it was a bonus because it was a higher SPF. After applying liberally and going outside for an hour I came in and had a bright red forehead and nose. This has done more damage to my face than I could have imagined. I'm disappointed that so many outlets would recommend such a horrible product. Do yourself a favor and your skin a favor and don't buy this!!!!",1,2,B002MSN3QQ
"I tried with this product. The first time I used it, while it did smell pretty bad, I didn't mind how it looked on my skin. Slowly, with more frequent use, it seemed to really dry my skin out and CLING like no other to ANY little dry area I had. It also balls up SO bad - who wants to deal with that every morning? Balling up so bad that there were many times I wanted to rewash my face and start all over again. What gives ELTA MD?? So not only did it ball up it also clung for its life to any area that was dry. It honestly just started to look and feel disgusting. So disappointed. It's like the longer I used it, the worse and more dry my skin got. Not sure what it was but something about it my skin hated and I can't fathom continuing to use this every day. Not a great way to start your morning, with an awful smell, little balls of white all over your face, and your dry spots highlighted with flaking white sunscreen. This is not the perfect daily sunscreen. It turned me off from wanting to try any ELTA product.",1,0,B002MSN3QQ
"Worth it. It’s expensive but I am on my third bottle. It’s fragrance free, moisturizing but not greasy, doesn’t break me out and my skin is dewy and protected. I hated sunscreen until I discovered this brand and more specifically the Clear version.
Please do not change formulation",5,2,B002MSN3QQ
"While this sunscreen didn't become my Holy Grail, it is still a very good product and the best sunscreen I've tried so far. It has great ingredients - niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, lactic acid. It doesn't cause breakouts or make my skin greasy, and I have noticed that my mineral powder lasts longer if I apply it after this sunscreen. That said, the product has a couple of drawbacks. Many reviewers said it has a lightweight formula, but it still feels heavy on my skin. I also dislike the strong chemical smell, though I nearly got used to it already. To add, there is a need to use a moisturizer under this sunscreen, otherwise my cheeks will be all flaky after a couple of days. My skin is more on the sensitive side, and I am not a hundred percent comfortable with this sunscreen, but I would still recommend it, especially for those with oily/combo skin types.",4,One,B002MSN3QQ
This product peels horribly. I could not get it to rub into my skin without it peeling and balling up. Even after allowing my products to dry and soak in it still peeled and crumbled. The finish is beautiful once you finally get it on. But I shouldn’t have to work this hard to apply SPF. Especially for one this expensive. For this price I expect my sunscreen to be compatible with the moisturizer I already own.,2,3,B002MSN3QQ
"Having purchased this product direct from my dermatologist, I was concerned that I might not get the ""real deal"", but the product I received/shipped from Amazon is the real thing. This product is, hands down the best sunscreen out there for protecting your face from burning and developing dark spots. The down side is that it goes on looking quite shiny, but you can put your makeup on over it. The up side is, without being oily the product is very slippery and spreads easily, so a little goes a long way.",4,4,B002MSN3QQ
"I have tried over 30 brands of sunscreen this year alone. This is my top pic. This is moisturizing, gentle on my skin even though I have super sensitive skin. It helps with my redness and I’m shocked it’s not a physical sunscreen. Usually chemical sunscreens irritate me. It doesn’t work as well as zinc oxide (physical), but it has zero white cast. And where I didn’t notice a difference in my skin tone immediately, I did notice a significant decrease in my redness after 2 weeks.

I see reviews that say this is counterfeit, I bought this here and 1 from the brands site directly, used 1 on each side of my face and both felt and performed the same. They also had the same expiration date and packaging.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"Great sunscreen. Never bothers my eyes, good to avoid hyperpigmentation. Doesn’t look “white”. My only drawback is it looks too shiny-greasy. However, I’ve stopped wearing a moisturizer with it, that helps. It is s good moisturizer. I usually use blotting paper after.",5,2,B002MSN3QQ
"Background on my skin type: I have extremely dry skin that is VERY prone to breaking out due to sugary/greasy food intake and sunscreen (not really due to period or dehydration). Also, I don't use this every day. I apply a tinted BB creme with SPF 30 (Maybelline Dream Fresh BB Cream) for make up days. I use Elta sunscreen when I'm being active like on the beach or hiking, or when I just decide not to wear make up.

This has been THE ONLY face sunscreen I have used that doesn't give me spots. It's very shiny, so I usually put some translucent powder over it, so it doesn't look like I'm super sweaty (dewy look isn't my preference).

I looked into getting some other sunscreens that were cheaper but still wouldn't clog my pores, but I didn't really find any adequate substitute for this product. I think it is worth it, because it will last for quite a while. It doesn't even take a full pump to spread evenly across my face (I have a normal sized face).",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I have rosacea and so I have used gazillions of facial sunscreens. This is a good sunscreen in that it was absorbed into my skin fast and nearly invisible compared to other sunscreens. I always wait five minutes and apply another layer of sunscreen. I believe for the amount of sunscreen you get in the bottle is way too tiny for the price. When I first glanced at the product bottle it looked bigger than what it was and not on the scale of other products its size. It is pretty much the price for the product, but it is a good product and I can tell from how red my face is even with sunscreen on. I am retired and live on 1/3 of the income I had when I was working, so, the price it too hefty in my opinion. Blue Lizard and Daylong are reasonably priced. If it wasn't for the cost difference and quantity of this product, I would buy it again.",3,One,B002MSN3QQ
"I was recommended this product by my dermatologist as I have melasma and oily skin. I’ve given up on sunscreens because they were like wearing greasy cake makeup. Even the ones for oily skin were an odd texture.
Well this product is a lifesaver or shall I say skin saver! The texture is amazing, it’s high quality and my skin loves it! It is not greasy and does not feel like it’s a thick coat on my skin.
I’m in Aesthetics school and I was telling my friend about it and two people in class chimed in with how much they love the product too. They have acneic skin and have no issues with this breaking them out.
I will continue to buy this product. So happy I was introduced to it!",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"This is the only sunscreen, so far, that hasn’t given me any rashes, break me out, or burn my skin. My skin is super sensitive, so I still do feel a little tingling, occasionally, but nothing uncomfortable. The main reasons why I did not give the product five stars are the following: unfortunately it is not water resistant, so it might not be ideal for sports; and everyone has a different skin, and while this is what works best for me, it might not be the case for everyone. As a moisturizer this did not do much for me (all sunscreens dry my skin out, some worse than others). So here is how I compensate for that factor. After washing my face, while still wet, I apply a hyaluronic based gel (thanks dr. Dray for the tip), I then slather on a moisturizer, and let it dry. Finally, I apply the sunscreen; that is the only way it won’t dry and make my skin peel. Cast wise, this sunscreen applies very nicely and smoothly, and does not leave any white cast (I did notice, however, that it might pill depending on what moisturizer you wear underneath). It does not feel or leave your skin greasy, but it does leave you with a little [dry] shine. OVERALL, with all that said, while the price is not the friendliest, I think that it’s worth the try if you’re looking for a good sunscreen that won’t irritate your skin.",4,One,B002MSN3QQ
"My dermatologist recommended this to me. I have combination skin - very oily in my forehead and around my nose but very dry everywhere else. I also am prone to acne scars and dark marks and my derm said this sunscreen is great for that type of skin because it contains zinc oxide. No complaints so far, I don't even wear foundation anymore! I feel comfortable just wearing this sunscreen and my skin has never looked healthier. And the bottle is small but it has lasted me over 5 months now even when I use it every day! So happy with this product.",5,One,B002MSN3QQ
"I have used this sunscreen for a few months now, and although the texture of the lotion is light and non-greasy, and doesn't leave a white cast to the skin, if you don't rub it in *just so* you end up with sunscreen flakes and areas of pilling. I also found the price rather ridiculous for the amount of product received. I recently found an excellent sunscreen by Rejuvelle, with a much more elegant formula and a much better value. Sorry EltaMD, I won't be buying this product again.",3,3,B002MSN3QQ
"I have used the EltaMD UV Broad Spectrum sun block for many years, primarily purchasing it from dermatologists offices. I do not think the product I received was the same product I have used in the past. The Amazon product was a thin, yellow colored fluid much more like a hand lotion than the white, thicker creme that the usual Elta product is like. I went to a dermatologist and bought a new EltaMD and threw away my Amazon product. I would not buy this product again and I would suggest that Amazon look into their supplier.",1,20,B002MSN3QQ
"I have sensitive skin and was told etlamd was GOOD for sensitive skin. I’m wondering if this was even the real thing or if I had received a knock off, so I’d recommend you buy directly through eltamd if you want their products. I gave the UV clear lotion and PM lotion a week chance. Skin absorbed it fast, but my face felt tight and very dry after putting it on. It was very uncomfortable. I tried applying the moisturizer several times to see if it helped but it made the problem worse. I started to develop a rash on my face which turned into red burnt looking scales. This product burned my skin. Took about a week not using this to recover from the burn. I do not recommend.",1,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I've tried using this product 2-3 different times now and I think I've given up on it. I'm kind of sad because of how many people like it and I know my Mother in Law uses it - so maybe i'll give her my bottle. But after trying to use it 2-3 different times for 2 days each I've had to stop each time. Some ingredient in it must be affecting my skin and it dries it out, makes my skin more sensitive, my face/neck start to feel itchy, I have a burning sensation when I put it on, and now I'm peeling more because it's dried my skin out - or has given me contact dermatitis.

It was recommended by my dermatologist as I told her I have really sensitive skin and any a lot of things will break me out or dry out my skin like crazy. For those that it does work for no offense to you - It does has a nice feel to it, but kind of greasy when put on the skin and I do notice it leaves a white cast on your face if you're not light skinned. I'm between light and medium toned and I can see a white cast.",2,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I ordered this because it was suggested by an instagram influencer I follow. I needed something that would last all day since I don’t want my face and neck to be covered in tons of old lady sun spots in 15 years.
She was right this sunscreen is perfect. I put it on everyday now! If I wear makeup, no big deal, I put this on first, and my makeup goes on just as easily right after. I’ll be ordering this again as well as looking into more of the eltaMD line!",5,One,B002MSN3QQ
"I find it interesting reading reviews because many times one contradicts the next one. I have been using this product for many years first recommended by a dermatologist. I have cystic acne which is not impacted by the product. I find the sunscreen relatively light, not greasy, very little fragrance, and only see white patches if I use too much. I put it on every morning after washing my face and before putting on makeup. It does not effect how my makeup goes on and I don't use a moisturizer in the morning. I reapply if I am going out in the sun for an extended period of time. My daughter is now using it too. I bought the face and body version for summer time and it worked well.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I think this is the first face sunscreen I use that doesn't break me out. I have tried many trust me, and this is good stuff. Also, it doesn't make me cry like most of the face sunscreen I have tried. Basically, I trashed so many face sunscreens because they caused allergies on my eyes and made me cry. I need to use this product (UV clear) after moisturizing otherwise it's a dry product for my face. What I don't like it's that it has some white color for my skin tone, maybe because I am kind of tan from the summer. It makes my face shinny (not oily tho), but I cannot use it without the moisturizer first, but I fix the shinny look with make up which runs really well after applying this sunscreen. I will keep using it, because it doesn't make me break up and cry, which is something I couldn't find in other sunscreens, but I will have to keep looking to other products to try to find a sunscreen that doesn't make my face shinny.",3,0,B002MSN3QQ
I've changed my skincare regimen multiple times this year to help deal with the maskne I started getting. I used ot use La Posay Roche which was great until I started using a mask which cause occlusive acne all over my face. Elta is thinner than LPR and it's geared towards acne and hyperpigmentation prone skin. I have not experienced any breakouts from using this and it's not too thick and perfectly spreadable.,4,One,B002MSN3QQ
"I wanted to find a moisturizer/sunscreen combo to avoid putting two products on my fussy combination skin. The facial sunscreen I had felt like it just ""sat"" on top of my skin, feeling oily; the moisturizer I had only helped the dry patches of my face and flared up the acne in my T-zone. Ugh. Hoorah, this product solves both of those problems! After using it for a few weeks, I have noticed that my skin tone is more even, I have fewer breakouts, and my skin is softer. The lotion does not leave an oily feeling on my face. I live in the PNW so I haven't had many chances to observe its sunscreen abilities, but the 45 SPF is much better than the 15 SPF I had that left me feeling like an oil slick.

One complaint: Elta MD, please put your product in a dispenser that is easier to reuse or recycle! If I'm going to use this product for the rest of my life, as I suspect I could, I would feel better not having to put each bottle in the trash. Please and thank you <3",5,One,B002MSN3QQ
"Recommended by my dermatologist. Wears well under makeup, as long as you let it set long enough (otherwise it may pill / flake). But no white-cast and is great for sensitive skin. It says something about acne, but I don't have any issues with acne and it works well with my combination skin.",5,2,B002MSN3QQ
"Yikes! I saw the other reviews saying that people broke out in rashes, or had a burning feeling from this product. I wish I hadn’t ignored it. I used it yesterday for the first time. By the time I wash my face in the evening, I could tell my face was all red. I woke up this morning to a rash all over my face, swollen eyelids, and just overall irritation. This will be going straight back where it came from!!",1,One,B002MSN3QQ
"So, I don’t doubt that this is a GREAT sunscreen. However (and this is partially my fault) it should be noted (especially in the title of the product) that this has Niacinamide in it! Now that’s great if you don’t have a skincare routine that conflicts with that. But, I do and I’m really really glad that I had done a simple break routine of just Calendula serum and moisturizer because if I had used any of my Direct Acids or Vitamin C serums I would’ve surely regretted it! Please double check your routine before adding this sunscreen into it!!",4,One,B002MSN3QQ
"Contains octinoxate 7.5%, which can affect the endocrine system and, when applied to the body of beach goers, it kills coral reefs and marine life. Picture found at the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration webpage. Go for mineral sunscreen!",1,2,B002MSN3QQ
"People should stop wasting money on facial sunscreen that’s too chalky, too sticky, too tacky, too irritating and too smelly. After tons of money wasted on bargain and expensive sunscreens, I’ve found my “it” spf.

This is the best I’ve used when compared to grocery store brands, premiere brands, facial mist sunscreens, baby sunscreens, sunscreen powders, etc.

I wanted a slightly moisturizing SPF I could wear over my morning facial serum and under my mineral makeup. I wanted to avoid any facial greasiness and an SPF that would prevent my light-coverage mineral makeup from setting. Additionally, I needed something that wouldn’t make me break out.

Elta is the first and only brand I’ve found that delivers on all my wants.",5,One,B002MSN3QQ
"I have been using Elta, MD products since 2015, buying them via Amazon since 2016. This one is very different in a very negative way. It has a chemical smell and it stings my eyes when I first apply it. It also runs into my eyes and mouth after 2 hours of wear. I have not experienced anything like this before. I did contact the company via phone and was promised a return call, but that never happened. I cannot use this on my face and can longer recommend the product.",1,2,B002MSN3QQ
Don’t let it get into your eyes! I was just in FL on vacation and used this for the first time. At one point I was sweating and it got into my eyes. I ended up with a horrible eyelid infection called blepharitis. Couldn’t open my eye for two days. Went to Urgent Care and ended up on antibiotics and eye drops. The doc said that one of the ingredients is a known pore blocker. Not good.,1,3,B002MSN3QQ
"Horrible, I usually always wear Korean sunscreen but decided heck, why not try this since we everyone hypes it up.....yes wrong choice, after I thought the other reviewers saying it gave them rashes and bumps might’ve just been their skin but NAH those reviews are real, my skin was so so beautiful unti BAM, this sunscreen gave me little bumps everywhere, not really pimples but little bumps like rashes:(, DONT buy this.... sad i lost $30 dollars but we live and learn... back to Korean sunscreen I go.",1,One,B002MSN3QQ
"My family has a history of Melanoma, so I wear spf every day to try to prevent it. This sunscreen is utterly exceptional and far better than any of the others I’ve tried. It has a higher spf than any other spf moisturizer I’ve used, and yet it does not make my skin appear white at all. It’s is extremely easy to rub into the face. Somehow, it seems to actually make my skin look better than before I put it on. It dosnt clog my pores at all, and it feels super nice and moisturizing on my skin. I feel super confident walking around outside everyday knowing that I am protected from the suns damaging rays. It is expensive, but even using it every day it lasts almost 2 months. It’s an insignificant price to pay for peace of mind that the sun isn’t damaging your skin every time you walk outside! IF YOURE ON THE FENCE BUY THIS NOW!",5,One,B002MSN3QQ
"I have avoided implementing a separate SPF product in my regimen for literally... ever. I hate the smell and feel of sunscreen on my skin. I have quite combo-oily skin and every other SPF product I've tried has only made me feel more greasy. Not this stuff. The texture is nothing like what I would expect from a sunscreen. It just feels like a normal moisturizer. It doesn't smell like sunscreen, really, either. I don't find that I get more oily during the day. On the contrary, I'd venture to say it might even help control my oil better than my normal routine alone. What really kind of shocked me is that it makes enough of a difference that when I forget to put it on before I put my makeup on, I sometimes remove the makeup and redo my whole skin care routine just to incorporate it, I like it that much.",5,2,B002MSN3QQ
"I love this sunscreen so much! I have extremely sensitive skin due to Differin and prescription Azelaic Acid. Literally everything burns. I was using Supergoop for months prior to starting the acne treatments, but once my skin became as sensitive as it is right now, Supergoop would burn. The only 2 things I use now are Vanicream moisturizing lotion and this EltaMD sunscreen. This sunscreen goes on smoothly, does not have that overpowering sunscreen scent, and does not leave a white cast. Love! I will use forever.",5,One,B002MSN3QQ
"I've been using this sunscreen for about 3 years. I've tried other sunscreens during that time, some of them very pricey, but I always come back to this- I've gone through about 5 or 6 bottles. I have extremely sensitive skin that stings if I use chemical sunscreens. I'm also prone to acne, rosacea, and hyper-pigmentation so to find a sunscreen that's specifically designed to not aggravate those issues is amazing. It has no white cast, no scent, and works beautifully under makeup. It's not matte but it's not greasy- it feels and looks like a very lightweight lotion but it totally works at protecting my skin. Truly the best sunscreen I've ever used.",5,4,B002MSN3QQ
"I can't scientifically prove that this works at the SPF that the package says, but I use it on my face and take a walk everyday and have not really tanned or developed the white spots on my face that I do have on my arms and legs, where I do not use sun block, because I want the Vitamin D. I not only use it as a sunblock, but also as a moisturizer. I chose it because it is uses zinc oxide instead of those chemicals that most sunblocks use, but it does not leave the white coating that most zinc oxide products so. I have been using it about a year and have it on subscription, every 2 months.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
This product is amazing. I bought this from a recommendation from a dermatologist on Tik-Tok and I am not disappointed. No break outs and it works all day! I work construction and am in the sun all day so a sun screen that protects without breaking me out of very important. I will continue to buy this product.,5,2,B002MSN3QQ
"I read the allure beauty review for this product and was sold. I admit I was a little bit leery of purchasing this product on Amazon after reading all the negative reviews about fake product. Went ahead anyway. My product arrived yesterday and it had an expiration date both on box and product. I used it for the first time this am and love it!! The product is dewy, very light weight and spread easily without drag across my face & neck. I found it has only a slight fragrance, which I don’t mind one bit.
Very glad I bought this product. I recommend anyone considering its purchase to go ahead without reservation.",5,One,B002MSN3QQ
"Just thought I'd leave a review because it's often hard for people of darker complexion like me to find a good sunscreen, this stuff goes on completely clear. No white cast. Also, with the niacinamide, it's really working to make your skin better and it's just a great one. A bit pricy but sun protection is important so I always splurge. 1 bottle lasts me ~3 months and I only use on my face.",5,One,B002MSN3QQ
"The good:
-It did not break me out.
-Formula was light weight.

The bad:
-It made my liquid foundation separate throughout the day (especially in my chin area).
-It leaves a strange white/purplish cast on my skin.
-Super expensive.
-The product pills up if you rub your face at all, resulting in little white balls all over.

Not worth it for me. If I am going to buy high-end facial products, I'll stick to La Roche Posay.",2,3,B002MSN3QQ
"I LOVE this stuff. It’s one of only two SFPs I’ll put on my breakout prone face. (Hawaiian topics tinted spf is my other fave when I want to look like I’m wearing a little makeup!) it covers great, moisturizes, and most importantly: doesn’t break me out. I’ve had a lot of trouble finding a zinc based facial spf that works for me and now that I have I’m a customer for life.",5,One,B002MSN3QQ
"I have tried a bunch of different sunscreens over the past few years. I have acne and I also have sensitive, combination skin. Yep, it's fun. The acne is genetic so I'm actually on a few skin treatments to keep my face clear. I have tried sunscreens ""designed for sensitive skin,"" (i.e. Aveeno) and I've tried sunscreens that are supposed to be ""really moisturizing"" (i.e. Neutrogena, etc.). Everything irritated my face. It was either really greasy or it made my face really red. As a young professional that really doesn't work. I had gotten this one from a Dermatologist in Spokane, Washington while I was in graduate school. It seemed too expensive and over the top. Well, I went back to using it recently and not only is it not horribly greasy (somewhat but tolerable), it doesn't irritate my face! I also don't break out, which is a HUGE plus for me. It's worth the money for me.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I couldn't really ask for more from a sunscreen. I am 40 and have combination, sensitive, and acne-prone skin (although curology has changed that last part)! This sunscreen is perfect for me. Zero white cast, moisturizing but doesn't cause a greasy t-zone, and the protection is great. I've tried countless SPF moisturizers and I will definitely stick with Elta MD. My only complaint is it is hard to tell how much product is left. The container is light and I'm always afraid I'm about to run out. Also, it's pricey, but definitely worth it for me!",5,2,B002MSN3QQ
"I found this gem on the Environmental Working Group (EWG) website. Do you know how hard it is to find a skin product that is safe from dangerous chemicals, gentle on sensitive skin, and that despite all this-still works effectively? It's even harder to find a higher SPF Sunblock that meets these criteria. Well, Elta MD has not only delivered on these promises: They offer all this in a formula that looks so natural that it doesn't leave you looking like a ghost or mime. It also applies smoothly to work well under makeup. On top of this, it does not clog my acne-prone pores or dry out my face. It even comes in a tinted version and is made in the U.S.A. What more do you want?? This is my sun protection product for life.",5,3,B002MSN3QQ
"Because of a rather involved basal cell surgery on my nose, I need a strong sun block for the scar. I’d been using the Neutrogena zinc product and it works well but it gives me a kabuki theater look. Very white and opaque. I don’t wear foundation, but I did discover that using some heavy blush over the top helps that effect—did that even when going to the beach. Anyway, thought I’d try this Elta product. It does leave a little bit of a white sheen, but not nearly as much as the Neutrogena. However, I think this formula—for sensitive, acne or rosacea prone skin—is not right for me. It makes my skin peel and flake—even on my chest it does that. I think that’s pretty strange for a sensitive skin formula. I’m willing to try a different one—perhaps a more moisturizing one, if that exists, but as it stands, I’d prefer kabuki face to flaky skin. Very disappointed.",1,0,B002MSN3QQ
"Wow, this is the most glorious sunscreen that I've ever tried. It goes on as smooth as the moisturizer I use as part of my acne 3 step system and then disappears! I can then use my roll-on concealer with no problems at all. Why am I so excited about sunscreen? I develop acne and acne scars easily and sunscreen keeps the dark scars from getting darker due to sun exposure.

I fear that it will be gone so quickly. As of now I use the slightest bit (2 pumps) on my face and neck and have retired my heavier sunscreens to cover my arms.

I have medium brown skin and it disappears entirely. No longer do I look like one of the walking dead and even if I sweat it does not run down my face and burn my eyes. I ordered the water resistant sunscreen too and I'm excited to try it as well.

I'll report back to let you all know how long it lasts. I may have to create a larger sunscreen budget, because so far I love using this product. I hate to fling around money willy nilly , but if a product works well it might be worth the extra dollars.",4,4,B002MSN3QQ
"I used this every day for about 2 months on my face and neck. I put it on under my skincare and under my makeup. It comes in a small plastic bottle with a pump. It comes out as a thick white liquid, about the consistency of a moisturizer.

This is what I can share about the product.
Pros:
- Does what it is made to do.
- Light scent, not overpowering sunscreen smell. Still scented though.
- Does not leave skin oily.
- Does not cause breakouts for acne-prone skin.
- Does not cause makeup to come off, as it does not dry down to be oily.

Cons:
- The amount of product you get versus the amount of product you get. The bottle is quite small.
- It does have a very very slight white cast to it. So if you have darker skin, and you will not be wearing makeup, it may be noticeable.",5,3,B002MSN3QQ
"When I went to use this for first time it spit out a bit right away before even pumping. Consistency seemed same but then I looked at bottom. Use by date and lot number is exactly the same as one purchased a year ago. This is so popular there's no way that could be same batch.
Will not buy this online again. Don't know if what I'm getting is even safe.",1,One,B002MSN3QQ
"Out of many sunscreen with Zinc oxide, this is one of them that don’t leave my skin with white cast (most of them do).
It is easy to apply. You can’t even tell I have sunscreen on my face. It still stung my eyes when the sweat drip from my forehead into my eyes........but it is not nearly as bad as all the other sunscreen that i’ve tried.
I don’t like how small of a bottle it came in for the price. Therefore, I will not be repurchasing this item.

Update: this product does not play well with my face cream (or any cream at all if it was applied before the sunscreen). It will pilled up. I will not be repurchasing this sunscreen.",2,One,B002MSN3QQ
Couldn't find a lot of stores that sold this brand of sunscreen online. Glad that I found this on Amazon and hoping it's real/legit! It's always scary buying beauty or skin care products and not wanting a knock off that will ruin your skin. So far I'm loving this product. It feels smooth on my skin and no heavy fragrance. I am pleased with the product and see why it's so highly recommended by dermatologists. Was doing my research and was hesitant with the price point compared to other name brand face sunscreen products but this seems worth it.,5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"While my face isn't exactly my money maker, I'm not trying to look like a saddle bag either! I've spent a small fortune on potions and creams from Sephora and turns out this under your makeup is all you need.

Let the hubs use it on vacation and now he keeps a bottle in his golf bag. Maybe he's a bit of a diva or maybe he just recognizes the world's greatest facial spf when he uses it!?!",5,One,B002MSN3QQ
"I have been using this product for years since my dermatologist first introduced it to me due to its strong sun protection with SPF 46. I later recommended to my friend who also purchased it after giving it a try during our trip to South America. The texture is really light and smooth, so you can apply foundation on it without feeling too heavy. Also I like the vacuum packaging for skin care products like this one.",5,One,B002MSN3QQ
"This product is amazing. Since I started using it my occasional pimples (which a dermatologist told me were hormonal and unavoidable) are ~95% gone and the 5% remaining are smaller and heal faster. The slight redness on my cheeks and chin were not flush, but were from the sun and are now totally gone. I have very pale skin and don't have any issue with the whitish tint other customers mention.

I have bought this product from Amazon for ~5 years, about 15 bottles total. Out of these, 2 had quality issues that made me suspect a counterfeit bottle. One bottle had a slightly different smell and color, but performed well. It may have been from a weird batch. The other bottle had a different smell which changed over time. It didn't provide the same skin benefits as the legitimate product.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I tried Eltas physical sunscreen and now this. I will say on a positive note, this one is easy to spread. but on my mediun brown skin, it left a white flaky residue on my face. my girlfriend has fair skin and she didn't have the same issue I did. just something to note depending on your skin tone. I will opt for a tinted sunscreen instead",1,One,B002MSN3QQ
"I'm giving this five stars because it really IS amazing sunscreen. I've suffered from breakouts my whole live until I tried Elta MD products; I am forever grateful that I can finally wear sunscreen to work every day. However, this bottle is tiny! I couldn't believe I didn't read closely enough to see that I was ordering - 1.7 oz. Holy Moly! There is no need to pay this price for such a small bottle. I usually get the tinted cream in the 3 oz squeeze tube for less, or the gigantic pump bottle for a similar price. In my experience the spf 46 isn't any better than another, just make sure you are getting chemical free - good for acne prone skin. There are so many good ones - next time I'll be more careful to see what is on sale :).",5,One,B002MSN3QQ
"So many products claim to be mattifying or meant for oily skin, and I usually watch them slide off my face after a few hours. Not this. If you’ve been looking for a face spf that keeps your skin bone dry, this is it. The feeling was so uncomfortable that I ended up buying the version for normal-dry skin and just use this on my hands, as I refuse to return it simply for doing what it said it’d do.

One star off because my skin was sensitive to it and I wouldn’t recommend it for anyone worth truly sensitive skin.",4,0,B002MSN3QQ
"This was recommended to me by two dermatologists, one of whom competes on her horses. It is an excellent product! It's light weight, provides great coverage, does not cause any irritation to my face or any breakouts. I have sent some to my daughter, who is an air force pilot, and she loves it! This lasts all year for me and I used it every day. Highly recommend!",5,3,B002MSN3QQ
"I bought this daily-use sunscreen on the advice of my dermatologist.
The cream pumps easily from the dispenser and applies smoothly without leaving a ghostly white residue. I also do not experience any sensitivity in my eyes.
I have normal skin but I find that the sunscreen can dry my skin a little, so I apply a couple of drops of marula oil to my skin beforehand and then there is no dryness.
I am very happy with this product - I went through an entire bottle in the spring and I am on my second bottle for summer - I don't think I have ever used a sunscreen as often as I use this one.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I never write reviews but my love for this sunscreen compels me to. I have acne prone skin meaning that it not only breaks out with each new moisturizer and sunscreen I use, but with any change in the weather or my diet (I want to say it's oily...but then sometimes it's super dry). I started using this sunscreen over my skin-accepted light-weight moisturizer and I have seen SUCH a difference. My skin rarely breaks out now (knock on wood) and my skin actually has a glow to it. It's so lightweight that I barely know it's there - except when I touch my skin and am amazed at how soft it is - and it reduces redness in any unruly acne spot that inevitably shows up and even seems to help heal them faster. Further, my skin tends to dry out from using acne products (retin-a in particular) and this has helped keep my skin smooth and moisturized (in conjunction with my salicylic acid moisturizer) without any excess oils. Moral of the story for anyone with acne prone skin, I would definitely give this a try.",5,One,B002MSN3QQ
I originally purchased this product when I started experiencing hyperpigmentation on my face after a trip to Costa Rica. I was freaked out and read a bunch of reviews for the best sunscreen. I love this product! It is really light weight and truly clear. No white residue. It has virtually no smell which I favor unlike suntan lotions that have that suntan lotion smell like you’ve been sitting by the pool. This has none of that. I wear it everyday. No breakouts or other skin reactions. I’m on my fourth bottle and just bought two more one for home and one for my gym bag! Felt like I owed it a review since it is really my go-to!,5,One,B002MSN3QQ
"I have a very oily forehead that likes to keep a speckling of bumps at all times. I struggle with shine and weird texture in this area as well. So I am looking for a sunscreen that is very lightweight and minimizes shine. This one isn't bad, but it still leaves a pretty noticeable shine on my forehead (the rest of my face soaks it up nicely though). Overall, I'd say it's pretty decent. I'll keep using it, and maybe that Niacinamide in there will work some magic and reduce my oiliness over time... we'll see! I'll post an update if anything changes.",4,0,B002MSN3QQ
"this is truly a fantastic sunscreen for the face. i love that it is a combo sunscreen so i don't have to worry about it degrading too fast, like avobenzone. for the most part i was using only asian sunscreens that contained better chemical filters not available in the states, they just apply so nicely to the skin, but this one applies very smoothly and leaves no white cast (on my skin tone anyway, i'm fair-medium). i would say the only downsides are the cost (it's actually gone down in price since i purchased it over a week ago), could potentially be irritating to anyone with a sensitivity to chemical filters, and that it is not reef safe.",5,One,B002MSN3QQ
"This was the first Elta MD product I've tried and I am satisfied! I bought this shortly after I started taking Accutane since my skin is extremely sensitive and I need lots of protection from the sun. It lasted me 4 months, allowing me 1-2 pumps a day. No burning or stinging! and my skin feels safe from the UV rays! I tried using cetaphil moisturizer with sunscreen when I ran out of this product and my skin was burning each time I applied, so I went ahead and purchased more Elta MD. It's pricier, but I trust it!!",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"Really great for sensitive skin and for post-prescription retinoid skin, if you've overdone it. No scent, feels good, spreads well. Does not sting eyes. I will continue to buy it and use it on my ""sensitive skin"" days, and on days when dust or pollen is irritating my eyes. I end up using it a couple times a week, or patting it around my eyes during allergy season, but I wish it didn't leave a small but noticeable white cast. Expensive, but I haven't found a less expensive dupe. This is good to have in your skin arsenal if your skin is sometimes or always sensitive to other sunscreens. Ditto for sensitive eyes.",4,0,B002MSN3QQ
Si eres hispano ten cuidado con esta crema a mí me dejó la cara blanca creo que me quitó pigmentación de lo fuerte que está deje de usarla en la barbilla no me hizo el mismo efecto que en las mejillas mi cara luce de las mejillas blanca y la barbilla la tengo café no me supieron dar una explicación del porqué mi dermatólogo dice que El zinc que contiene la crema eso me pudo haber causado una alergia si eres de piel Moreno claro o moreno no te lo recomiendo,1,One,B002MSN3QQ
"This is everything I never knew I always needed in a sunscreen. 😁 Seriously though, after trying and hating almost ever facial sunscreen I’ve tried from Neutrogena to Tatcha to Glossier to many other brands, I have finally found a daily sunscreen (for the face) that doesn’t make me go “yuck” when I apply and wear it. It’s a light formula with almost nil cast. Finally no more greasy or heavy feeling. Full disclosure, it’s not water or sweat proof so use something else while working out or going to the beach.",5,2,B002MSN3QQ
"Idk how effective it is at sun protection but everyone recommended this including dr dray. My personal derm recommended niacinamide for rosacea. I normally cannot use anything with heavy silicones or I break out in painful cysts. I thought this would be okay since the first silicone is volatile even though it’s the 2nd ingredient. It was easy to apply because of the silicones and didn’t leave a white cast. A couple hours after application it began to pill horribly! Which means in the areas it pilled, my skin was vulnerable to uv rays. I only put on moisturizer after it so it’s not like I had layers of product on top. Forget about layering makeup on top of this. By the end of the day I had several painful cysts and a smaller rash with bumps. I do not recommend this product, and it is way too expensive.",1,0,B002MSN3QQ
"my skin is really sun-sensitive. In the past, I have broken out into rash after using regular sunscreens (many brands)...this is little different. it gets absorbed quickly (but a little greasy - not unbearable though). plus, didn't cause any rash. I will pay the price for the quality of this product.",5,2,B002MSN3QQ
"I have used EldMD sunscreen for years, starting when I turned 30 and noticed hyperpigmentation from sun damage. I am allergic to chemical sunscreens and did not wear sunscreens because the reaction I had to those chemicals was worse than getting a sunburn. But with age, the hyperpigmentation became quite noticeable and I had to make a change to my skincare regimen. This sunscreen works well for my sensitive skin (no breakouts or allergic reactions) and I have been able to reverse some of the sun damage I've caused to my face. I do not leave the house without applying this sunscreen and it goes on light and does not clog pores.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I bought this sunscreen after a long search for a great physical sunscreen for my face. Its got great reviews here & on YouTube. Unfortunately it did not work well with me. I'm not sure if its because I bought it on Amazon but I dont think I'll spend money on it again.
1. You have to make sure to rub it in well or it'll leave white cast marks.
2. Even when rubbing in well, after several hours I would check my face & I'd notice streaks of white close up.
3. I only bought it to use on my face under makeup. When I'd go to rub in my primer or even just the foundation, the sunscreen would start to peel off.
4. This particular one ( UV Clear) always leaves my skin feeling dry.

Never got sunburned (so that's a plus) but wont buy again.",3,0,B002MSN3QQ
I’ve gotten another bottle of this a couple years ago and am just writing a review since I tried it on again the other day. This product sometimes feels slightly burning and will (somewhat often)peel when I put it on my skin even with nothing underneath or over it in my skincare products. I noticed the first bottle would peel on my skin as well but I liked it so much I kept it and used it up. When I put a first layer on it peels sometimes. When reapplying it doesn’t peel but later on if I rub my face or apply more it peels at least a little. Not sure what this means? If it’s my skin not liking it or if the product is off (bad batch)? It’s a kind sunscreen otherwise.,3,One,B002MSN3QQ
"Not sure if I received a counterfeit or expired item. Once applied the product sheds like a snake. Don’t even know how to describe it, can’t wear it at all because it is like if I had gotten a sunburn and the skin is coming off. Awful, haven’t had this problem in the past and I’ve been using the same brand for over a year. Like I said it must have been a counterfeit or expired.",1,One,B002MSN3QQ
"There is a reason why this sunscreen is so highly recommended for sensitive skin. I have oily/combo skin and find that this applies smoothly and while not particularly moisturizing, it doesn’t make my skin feel tight or dry over the course of the day. It is also one of few sunscreens that have not felt irritating/contributed to breakouts. Have not had any issues purchasing (& one repurchase) through Amazon as the product quality has been consistent for me and Amazon is an authorized reseller according to the manufacturer (unlike a popular online Derm focused website, which is surprisingly on the manufacturer’s unauthorized reseller list).",5,One,B002MSN3QQ
At first I did not like this sunscreen at all and stopped using it. I recently gave it another try and now I like it much better. I originally thought this sunscreen was making me break out and since it is for sensitive skin I was unhappy about that. Then later I found out a food sensitivity was making me break out so I kept it to try again once my skin settled down. I am glad I did because it is not causing issues now. I took off a star because I do experience some redness in my cheeks when I have used it and l worry that will eventually cause more inflammation so I alternate it with my totally mineral sunscreens.,4,0,B002MSN3QQ
My dermatologist recommended this to me after my skin reacted badly to several other brands of sunscreen. This is my holy grail sunscreen. I have very sensitive pale skin and this stuff is nothing short of a lifesaver. I am outside frequently during the day and have yet to burn. This formula is so sheer and light that I don't feel it at all once it has dried. It has zero white cast and doesn't appear in photos with a flash. My wife says it also wears really well underneath makeup and doesn't cause pilling. The price is a little high for my taste but it is something I am happy to splurge on because of the high quality compared with other sunscreens.,,One,B002MSN3QQ
"This was my first time buying pricey sunscreen and I was super disappointed. I have mild sensitive skin. All sunscreen that I’ve used will make me break out if applied everyday. I was hoping this product would prevent that from happening, but it didn’t. Also, when I applied it to my cheeks, it burned pretty good. Aside from the breakouts and burning, the worst part was how dry it made my face. It took me over a month to get my face feeling back to normal.

The only positive thing to say about the sunscreen is that it really absorbed into the skin and didn’t make my skin shiny and oily.",1,One,B002MSN3QQ
"I have fair skin, and my family has a long history of skin cancer. My dermatologist implores me to wear sunscreen daily. I don't want to get skin cancer; I don't care about being tan. However, I have always HATED applying sunscreen. I hate how it feels going on, it makes my makeup weird, it doesn't absorb, it makes me sweat, or some other similar problem. Anyway, I looked online a fair amount after my last derm appointment, and thought I would give this one a shot. I love it. I don't have any of the problems that I just described. It is very light weight and quick to absorb. My skin is dry and a little sensitive, but I don't have trouble with dryness or irritation. ON the other hand, it is not oily. It just sort of disappears (within seconds). I've only been using it for about a week, so I guess if something changes I'll come back to update. In short, I know it's expensive, but I would highly recommend it to anyone who is struggling to find a daily sunscreen that they will actually use.",5,One,B002MSN3QQ
"Was recommended to me by my derm, I have acne prone dry skin, I’m also very pale so spf isn’t something I can skip. I wear it under full coverage foundation, blends seamlessly no weird white shadow to it. Smells good, kinda like almonds? And also helps to stop any acne coming to the surface. The price isn’t great at first, but I understand why, it works.",5,One,B002MSN3QQ
As someone with super sensitive breakout prone skin sunblock was an absolute nightmare until I found this! This doesn’t irritate my skin and flare my rosacea or cause my skin to breakout at all and it offers the sun protection I desperately need! I used to dread summer as it meant sunblock but now I finally have one that doesn’t destroy my face! It’s easy to spread and doesn’t leave me greasy or dry it’s just perfect and worth every penny!,5,One,B002MSN3QQ
"If you don't already know, Elta MD UV Clear is one of the best sunscreens on the market. It doesn't leave a white cast; it doesn't have a lotion texture; it doesn't give you acne breakouts.

As for the authenticity here on Amazon... as long as the listing states it is sold and shipped by Amazon then you have nothing to worry about. It is completely legit. Lot numbers were clearly stated and a sufficient expiration was clearly stamped as well.

If you want a quality sunscreen that doesn't feel like sunscreen then this is it!",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"Summary:
An excellent face sunscreen, but unfortunately comes with a strong scent some may find off-putting. I will be returning this product and trying other facial sunscreen instead.

Application:
- Very easy to spread across the skin and dried down matte almost instantly, with little to no white cast (note: I am pale; your experience may vary based on skin tone)
- Did not feel very moisturizing; I would use this over my regular moisturizer, but not in place of it

Scent:
- Very strong scent, slightly sweet, almost fruity; kind of like cough syrup
- Faded from notice after an hour, but was very distracting until then
- If you are sensitive to scents, you may wish to sniff-test a sample in person at a local store, or return after ordering if it's too much",3,0,B002MSN3QQ
After doing a lot of research for sunscreen I came across this product about a year ago. Doesn’t leave your skin feeling oily and doesn’t run down your eyes when you’re working out. Even in the high elevations it protects your skin. I use it every day at work and when I’m doing Exercising or doing outdoor activities.,5,One,B002MSN3QQ
"I LOVE this sunscreen! For years I had smooth, hydrated skin but about 6 months ago I was randomly slammed with persistent hormonal acne including cysts and tons of under-the-skin whiteheads. I had to revamp my whole skin care regiment and my dermatologist recommended adding this sunscreen to it. It’s lightweight and DOES minimize redness of inflamed acne. My face is still oily in the Florida heat but this product helps to manage it. While in this horrible skin flare-up my skin has been ultra sensitive but it welcomed Elta MD so I will keep using this sunscreen as long as I can afford it.",5,One,B002MSN3QQ
"Impressive sunscreen! worth the price! I really wasn't expecting much, but i'm so impressed I will def reorder. I like that its a pump, has minal smell and the white cast disappears very fast, in addition it leaves a matte finish that reminds me of a primer I once used. I'm using it with mac weight less foundation, no streaking or altering the color. I I'm a usual neutrogena girl but have on other occasions, tried expensive but effective sunscreens, yet i never felt motivated to reorder them. this is a winner, I can see why its so popular!",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I used to never wear sunscreen on my face because I didn't like how it felt, especially under makeup. So glad I found this sunscreen because I actually love wearing it, which I never thought I'd say about a sunscreen. It doesn't feel greasy, it doesn't leave any white residue, it doesn't cause me to breakout, and it goes on great under my other products. Would definitely recommend. Only con is that it's expensive",4,One,B002MSN3QQ
"Once I used this product, I broke out worse than I was before using. I have pretty bad acne in my 30’s and just use tea tree oil and retinol to treat with fairly good luck. Every time I use this within a few days I get a flare up on my chin, cheeks, and jaw line. Used several times in the past year and the result is the same every time so I know it’s not a fluke.",1,One,B002MSN3QQ
"As a person with brown skin, I can confirm that this sunscreen doesn't leave a white cast. As you are applying, in five seconds you'll see that the white tint goes away. I tried many sunscreens chemical/physical formulas over the past years, Drunk Elephant, Shiseido, Super Goop etc. This one stands out among them. I didn't get any breakouts. No goopy mess thanks to the pump bottle and reasonable price. I'll be purchasing again.",5,2,B002MSN3QQ
"Edit... Amazon sent a reply right away. It was seamless. The prouct itself, I LOVE. It is the only sunscreen that I know won't break me out, calms the redness in my cheeks, and works. I never get burned when I wear this luxurious sunscreen... feels like I'm wearing nothing and makeup goes on smoothly. I exfoliate regularly so I burn easily, my cheeks especially since I have mild rosácea.

My item never arrived. So I cannot review it,.and I cannot return for a refund! Trying to find a way to contact someone to make this right. Item not cheap.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"This item came already opened. I could tell as soon as I looked at the bottle, as it had a little bit of the product around the opening (see phot). When I pumped it, the product immediately came out - with a new product, it would require several pumps before anything came out. From now on I'm only getting from Costco or my dermatologist. It's such a bummer to return this, as I know the product will just go in the bin, but I can't believe they thought they could sell me opened goods.",1,3,B002MSN3QQ
After hearing so many good things about this sunscreen for break out prone skin I was excited to try it. Unfortunately for me my skin didn't like it. It has a nice texture and absorbs well but I wore this while on a vacation that involved lots of walking and sweating. Once I started sweating this made my face burn to the point that it was painful! I know it was this sunscreen because it was the only new addition to my skincare and the next day I didn't wear it and I also didn't have the burning sensation when I would sweat. I gave three stars since it does feel nice and absorb well.,3,2,B002MSN3QQ
"The bottle came damaged and without a cap, and the box was smashed and showed signs of being opened. There are some marks around the container itself, and there’s no telling whether or not it has been used or tampered with as the cap with sticker seal is nowhere to be seen.

As it was purchased specifically for my mom who has severe sensitivity, she can’t use it for fear that it may trigger her rosacea.",1,One,B002MSN3QQ
"As someone who has an acne-prone, oily in parts and dry in others, face, this is the best moisturizer I have found. I originally got it from my mother in law who purchased hers from her dermatologists office. What I love is that it does not feel greasy, or leave my face looking like an oil slick AND has SPF 46- none of this SPF 15 stuff that doesn't protect your face from the sun. It is a bit pricey but is totally worth it. I break out less too since using it because it really doesn't clog your pores.",5,2,B002MSN3QQ
"It is light weight and moisturizing. I put it on before I apply my makeup in the morning and it doesn't feel heavy.
I showed my Dermatologist E ltaMD UV Clear Facial Sunscreen Broad-Spectrum SPF 46 because I have sensitive skin. He said he puts this on his children and it a great to use all the time.",5,One,B002MSN3QQ
This is a super light weight formula for people who don’t like heavy textures on their skin! It says it is clear but I do find it to make me look a little paler than I am. I’m not sure if I would recommend this for BIPOC. Bc of its texture it sits nicely under makeup as well!,5,One,B002MSN3QQ
"I really do like this sunscreen but paying almost $40 for it is a little ridiculous... I did use the entire bottle and was in need of another... but the price is just too high.. So I went back to my go to , the one that starts with a C... I used this during/after accutane and I never broke out... it’s a moisturizing sunscreen and has the same skin glowing blurring effect as the Elta MD Clear at more than 1/2 the price... so if you are looking for something similar to the Elta MD Clear but don’t want to pay$$$... try the one that starts with a C ....",4,0,B002MSN3QQ
"Tengo 6 protectores solar almacenados para ver si cuando valla a cuba los uso en la playa porq son demasiado denso pensé que todos eran así hasta que encontré este es maravilloso se esparce por toda la piel ,no es grasosos la piel lo absorbe fácilmente me encanta lo recomiendo encaresidamente",5,One,B002MSN3QQ
"I love this sunscreen and have typically purchased through my dermatologist’s office, but started buying on Amazon for convenience/price. Received this product today and realized that I have been paying full price to receive a TESTER!!? So mad and disappointed, as these are sent complimentary to authorized distributors. Returning immediately and will pay a few extra dollars from my dermatologist from now on. I guess someone could have removed the sticker and I would have never known? Buyer beware!",1,0,B002MSN3QQ
This is not for sensitive skin. I had an allergic reaction to this sunscreen. I used this and another tinted sunscreen on different days but the formulations were similar with only two active ingredients zinc oxide and Octinoxate. Be aware that this is a combination sunscreen and contains a chemical filter. Octinoxate is probably the culprit in both sunscreens that made my face break out in a horrible rash that hasn’t gone away (despite the fact that I stopped using both products) after several days. Octinoxate is a derivative of cinnamate that can cause allergic reactions in some people. If you have sensitive skin it’s probably best to stick to an all mineral sunscreen.,1,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I am purchasing this sunscreen for a second time. As a person of color, it's been hard to find a sunscreen that doesn't leave a white residue.

Not only does this sunscreen disappear into my skin, but it's also good for my acne-prone skin, and doesn't cause breakouts.

It's more expensive than what I find at the drugstores, but in my case, I'm definitely getting what I'm paying for. Well worth it.",5,3,B002MSN3QQ
"This stuff is so protective and moisturizing. It applies easily and is very hydrating. I have very sensitive skin and I can break out easily with some sunscreens, so I was nervous the first time I used this. But I have never had a reaction or a breakout from it, and this is now my third bottle. I live in Florida and the sun and humidity is brutal - I find it protects really well. There have been days where its been a little too moisturizing (when we've had very high humidity) but generally it plays well in the heat, and on top of my usual skincare. I don't experience piling with this, and although it initially leaves a white cast, it does absorb easily and disappears after a few seconds of applying. I only use it on my face, and a dime sized amount seems to do the trick. So I find it lasts quite a while (I use drug store sunscreen on my body) but if you were tempted to use it on your body as well I can imagine it wouldn't last long. This really is my holy grail sunscreen!",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I discovered Eltamd UV Clear SPF 46 after searching for ""non comedogenic sunscreen"", in other words a sunscreen specially formulated so as not to cause blocked pores.

I use sunscreen everyday, all year, on my face and hands. This is the best sunscreen I've ever used. It comes in a pump that's easy to use. It goes on smoothly and blends perfectly on my skin. I use it over moisturizer and there's never small non absorbed pieces as with other facial sunscreens I've used.

Although I don't have acne, my skin is ""tender"" and can get irritated by certain products. I've had no problems while using this sunscreen. Whether you have sensitive skin, problem skin, or just skin, I highly recommend this product if you really care about your face.",5,One,B002MSN3QQ
"This feels a little greasy but it does not irritate my sensitive skin which is a huge bonus. I tried samples from my dermatologist and was pleased so I decided to save myself a 30 min drive to their office to buy more and just get it on Amazon (same price both places). What I failed to notice, and is the reason I gave only 3 stars, is that this is not waterproof or sweat-proof. I don't like how greasy it feels for everyday use, but that's what this is for; I wanted it for daily walks year-round and for beach trips. After several days at the beach putting on sunscreen, my skin gets red and bumpy and irritated. This product did NOT do that when I tried the samples so I was excited to have found something that worked for me. It's fine for winter, but when I start to sweat in warmer weather, I'm not protected. This is my fault for not reading the label more closely, but a bummer to have spent so much money for something I can't use year-round.",3,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I have to say I've gone many years unfortunately without wearing sunscreen because it Make my eyes tear up, right before I was trying to put on make up!!
I found this product and my eyes and face are Thanking me! I've experienced Zero sensitivity if the product gets into my eyes And because my face is generally on the dry side I find that Elta MD also gives enough moisture Without that horrible sunscreens smell.
It's definitely worth a try! I won't go to any other brand now that I've found something that works!",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
Why is this listed as a mineral sunscreen? It has octinoxate which is a chemical sunscreen. They need to update the description and ingredients on Amazon as I don't see this mentioned anywhere. I'm allergic to chemical sunscreens so this one is getting returned.,1,One,B002MSN3QQ
"First bottle I bought worked ok but the pump broke so I purchased another when it came I noticed the pump was completely different. About a week went by and I developed a terrible chemical burn on my neck and chin. I have stopped using this product and my burn is slowly getting better. I would return this product but the window has closed. Great product if you want painful burns, neck biopsy, expensive dermatology appointments and great deals of pain. It's one thing to be ripped off another to be physically hurt. If I ever see elta on the streets you know it's on.",1,3,B002MSN3QQ
"This product is excellent, and my favorite, hands-down, which is why I continue to purchase it despite the flawed dispenser. I have purchased this three times on Amazon, and each time there comes a point when the sunscreen begins to leak out of a(n initially sealed) hole in the bottom. I simply store the dispenser upside down, and hold it upside down when I pump it out. It's still more convenient than dealing with driving to my very busy dermatologist's office to buy it there, but may be a dealbreaker for some of you.",3,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I use the Elta MD UV Daily 40 SPF, without any problems, but I thought I would try this one because of the higher SPF. I tried it yesterday - having run out of 40SPF. I broke out in a red kind of rash, and today still have lingering slight redness. , . Not terrible, but enough to think I should have used this product within the return period to test it. MY advice with this, any product is to test it right away even if you don't plan on using it right away. Buying this turned out to be a waste of money. Will either go back to Elta MD SPF daily 40 , or see what other manufacturers have.",2,One,B002MSN3QQ
I needed a new sunscreen so I started doing my research about the sunscreens in the market and I saw a lot of good reviews about this product. I ordered it and received the product and started using it right away. The main problem with this product is that it causes a lot of dryness around the eyes. I have an oily skin and I used an eye cream under the sunscreen but unfortunately it caused a lot of dryness around my eyes. The more time passes since you apply the cream the more it gets dry and starts showing wrinkles around the eyes that you didn’t have in the first place. I’m a dermatologist so I thought maybe the eye cream that I used is not that hydrating so I used a pomade like heavier eye cream underneath the sunscreen. But unfortunately this dryness persists. It causes progressive dryness and wrinkles around the eyes that makes you stop using it after 2 applications even when you use a very hydrating eye cream underneath. Very very disappointing. Unfortunately the time frame for return has passed and I can’t return it although I couldn’t use it even on my hands.,1,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I’ve heard lots of praises for this sunscreen. I was skeptical because the praises came from someone with dry skin while I have super oily skin. However, after trying it for a couple days, I can say I really like it! It doesn’t make my skin feel any more oily than it normally does come mid day/late afternoon. It works well under my foundation (Estée Lauder Double Wear Light). It actually says “oil free” on the bottle. I’ve seen some reviews say they got a fake product. Mine has the EXP & LOT numbers on the bottom. Has a nice smell, comes out white but goes on clear. Thankful for a great product to protect my skin!",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"Wow! I have extremely sensitive facial skin + acne rosacea (outbreaks controlled with meds). The skin on my face cannot take any type of fragrance or harsh chemicals because it burns, itches, and feels like fire ants are walking all over it. I have tried ALL sorts of sunblock products and even the mildest ones left my skin feeling from uncomfortable to downright painful :(

Eltamd has changed everything for me! I didn't want to get my hopes up too high when I ordered this product because I'd been let down by so many other brands before. Man, oh man. I was incredibly relieved, surprised, and GRATEFUL to see/feel for myself that Eltamd does what is says! It is calming on my skin (this has never happened with ANY other sunblock before!), COMPLETELY sheer, and has absolutely no strange smell whatsoever. I was able to wear it under my mineral powder make-up and my face didn't look shiny or feel gunky AT ALL.

I will continue buying this product for as long as it's made. I'm only sad that I didn't discover this before now.",5,One,B002MSN3QQ
"This was good and didn’t burn my skin while using tretinoin! Yay!

Update:
This has been one of the best sunscreens that I have ever used. With dark African-American skin, it does leave a bit of a white cast when put on. It does also sting a bit, but I think it’s from the niacinimide in it. It is also a bit greasy, but for me that’s not too big of a problem. I would recommend it over neutrogena products and if it’s too expensive look into PURITO sunscreens here on Amazon. Make sure the seller is PURITOKOREA.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"First off let me say you need to wear sunscreen!! And reapply throughout the day if you want your sunscreen to be affective. This sunscreen is a great physical sunscreen. It does leave a white cast and it balls up if you rub or put makeup on over it. It does not break me out or irritate my skin. It is really gentle and slightly drying on my skin at least. It has a light texture and no fragrance. It has a slight sunscreen smell but I got used to it and it does not bother me at all. It is on the pricey side for the size of the bottle, but I think it is worth it if you are looking for one of the best physical sunscreens in the US.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
I got this because of all the positive reviews but I was really disappointed :( I have dry skin and this sunscreen made my face look too greasy for my preference. It feels like it would just rub off if I touched my face and takes a long time to dry down. I really don’t like the way any of my make up sits on top of it (even a small amount of power or concealer) it also tends to pill when I apply it unless I don’t use any other skin care products under it or I take time to pat it in carefully. It does have a high spf which is nice but the smell is the worst part of this product for me. It has that sunscreen smell which stays on my face for hours and I can smell it all day. Even on my fair skin tone I can see a slight white cast in certain lightings so my guess is that this won’t work for darker skin tones. In my opinion there are so many better/more cosmetically elegant/less sticky/less expensive options out there and I would not recommend this product.,1,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I usually never do reviews and i was very hesitant to buy this because of the price, and mostly i was scared it was going to break me out. I have very sensitive skin and have been dealing with horrible acne the past year. BUT it doesn't break me out!!! It actually moisturizes, doesn't leave that white film like other sunscreens & doesn't have strong sunscreen smell at all- I can barely even tell its sunscreen.
I have combo skin, it is more dry in winter months and then more oily in summer due to humidity. Sometimes I'm in the middle, (normal) but that's pretty rare LOL.
I have been using for 5 months everyday and I still have some left in my bottle. I LOVE this product & will be using for as long as I can.",5,2,B002MSN3QQ
"My mother has struggled for years with acne, redness, and other face related irritations. She's gone to several dermatologists, has had skin biopsys, been diagnosed with so many things from autoimmune disorders, to protein disorders, and other skin conditions. Nothing has helped, at some point in the day, sometimes without going outside, her face would turn bright red, think of very severe rosacea. One day, she ran out of her $50 sunscreen that she said was the only thing that helped (didn't really) (also we understand how spf works and after a certain amount its pretty pointless, so I never understood why she was buying those super expensive high spf sunscreens), so I told her I'd order her one on amazon. After digging for awhile, I stumbled on this listing. The price still seemed high for a sunscreen as compared to your generic store brand, but this one seemed to soothe the skin and help with rosacea. I pulled the trigger, now we are on our second bottle. I don't know why, but this is like miracle cream, her skin problems are about 90% gone, her face has cleared up, not a sight of redness anywhere. We are now done spending so much on other creams, this serves as a jack of all trades. Probably will be ordering this stuff for life, really a night and day difference for my mother and worth every penny.",5,3,B002MSN3QQ

This is the product she recommended to me, and I adore it! I have fairly sensitive skin, both to small breakouts when I change products/sweat with products on my face, but also I get a stingy feeling from most sunblocks on my face. This stuff is so smooth, light, non greasy, dose not interfere with makeup application at all, have had zero irritation or breakouts and she said it doubles as a daily moisturizer. win win win!",5,One,B002MSN3QQ

I am light skinned, latina, 31 with sensitive oily skin. I have redness around my nose and cheeks with acne marks and brown spots. This is the first spf I've used that doesn't break me out or makes me look shiny or greasy.
I had the laser matrix done which has help in brightening my skin. I started using this to keep my face from becoming dull.
This evens out my skin tone...somehow calms the redness and makes my face look flawless. No shiny no white cast. Even in photos my skin looks awesome. It doesn't have tint but somehow this spf makes my skin glow. I don't wear any powder or makeup anymore because of this. My skin feels nice and with a velvety look and feel not matte.
I 100% recommend.
Also when I wear this my blush stays put for the whole day at least 13 hrs.
Love it!",5,2,B002MSN3QQ

"This product has glowing reviews but most seem to leave out the fact that this WILL leave a white cast on persons of colour. I am Asian and of medium to dark skin tone and it leaves a significant white cast. It cannot be worn alone and must be covered with makeup. So while it may be suitable for fairer skinned people, people of colour need to be mindful of this which is something I wish I knew before I bought it. Also I live in a humid climate and the sunscreen does not go on matte and is actually pretty greasy. But this may be due to my climate so might be better in colder climates. I was disappointed in this product. Pros include the fact that it doesn't make me break out and sits nicely on the skin. But all in all I would not repurchase. Dermatologica does a sunscreen that actually goes on clear and I would go back to that instead",3,10,B002MSN3QQ
I've tried for years to find a good every day facial sunscreen. I have discoid lupus and sun protection is essential. I have used this every day for about a month now and continue to plan on using it. I've stopped using other moisturizers as this suffices. I haven't had any new lesions (no sunburns either). The only down fall is that at about 10-12 hours my skin gets really slimy.. like I can feel a layer of film over it. I just wash my face as it's mostly dark by then and it's fine. I haven't had any acne breakouts either. Definitely recommend,5,0,B002MSN3QQ

I have been using this for approximately two years now and I purchase via Amazon because I can not find it at the local store.

"I typically hate the smell of sunscreen, but this one has very little smell which is amazing! It has a lightweight texture, making it much more comfortable to wear. It didn't break me out, and the niacinamide helped reduce post-inflamatory hyperpigmentation from the acne I already had. While it did have some whitecast, it's much less than other sunscreen products I've tried. I have mildly textured skin, and it applied evenly enough for the slight whitecast to be uniform instead of patchy, making the whitecast less noticeable. All that said, I don't recommend wearing it with makeup, as it peels when rubbed. Reapplying can also cause some peeling/patchiness in the product, so I'd recommend wiping some of the earlier layers off with a damp cloth before reapplying.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ

"Eltamd UV Clear SPF 46 puts other sunscreens to shame.

- absorbs VERY quickly
- does not make my face feel greasy at the the end of the day--even after hours and hours of wear
- no white residue
- does not leave the face feeling the least bit sticky
- dries without a trace--I can't even tell I'm wearing it
- no sunscreen-y fragrance. it's actually pretty odorless
- paraben-free
- oil-free
- no added fragrance (great for sensitive skin)

This sunscreen is amazing! It is so light that I sometimes have a hard time believing it's really a sunscreen, since sunscreens are traditionally pretty heavy, goopy, and unpleasant. Usually the higher the SPF, the more viscous the sunscreen. But this sunscreen is still lighter than most SPF 15 sunscreens out there--and it's SPF 46!

I have sensitive/dry skin and this stuff has never irritated it. My sister is blessed with a more normal/oily complexion and this sunscreen works great for her as well.

To top it all off, this sunscreen is paraben-free, oil-free, and has no added fragrance. It doesn't have the harmful chemicals found in most other sunscreens. EltaMD must really take pride in their products to have achieved such an amazing product that is also still good for your skin.

I couldn't ask for more in a sunscreen!",5,2,B002MSN3QQ
"I have been cycling a lot already this year and will be out in the sun for hours. I have never gotten burned or even slightly red on my face or neck where I apply the Elta MD Clear. On my body, I use chemical sunscreen 50+ spf and have tan lines from my shoes and cycling gloves.

I have a problem with my pores clogging. I have used Retin-A Micro in the past and every other sunscreen burned like the dickens when I applied it. The Elta MD Clear did not. Now, I just used Proactiv Plus as night and Elta MD Clear in the mornings. I recently went to see a PA about getting Botox for migraines. She commented on how nice my skin is. I just turned 30 and hardly every wear foundation (if I do it is Jane Iredale Pure Pressed Base).

Elta MD Clear is a white cream but dries clear. It has not caused me to breakout or clog my pores. Since using just Elta MD Clear in the mornings and Proactiv Plus at night, my nose has actually unclogged A LOT. I usually buy 3 of these at a time because I never want to run out!",5,2,B002MSN3QQ

"Pricey for sunscreen, but I guess decent quality has those effects. This is the sunscreens that my aesthetician recommended and also the sunscreen I always see while doing research for ""best sunscreen to buy"" for my skin. Hesitant to purchse it at the salon despite their recommendation because of the $30 price. But then after much research, ended up buying it on amazon.

Zinc Oxide is what we need to look for in the ingredients and while drugstore ones like neutrogena have it, it's too sticky and gunky on skin. It's fine for those who don't mind it, but the formula is not to my liking. This one is also favors acne prone skin like mine. It's lightweight, no white caste as other zinc oxide suncreens do, and it's not oily either.

It keeps changing it's prices. I bought it initially for $33, and it's $30 at my salon. But then the second time I bought it, it was $26ish, which balanced the price out I guess. Maybe it's a buy one get the other one some 20% percent off or something I guess.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ

She had given higher end recommendations, this being one, along with less expensive ones, such as Neutrogena for sensitive skin and other Neutrogena products. Those either caused me to break out into a rash or were thick and would leave me with white patches if I didn't rub in enough. This Elta MD is very light and no rash.

The skin easily absorbs it. Feels very light, and stays on throughout the day.

I apply it in the morning or before going outside, right after my moisturizer. I feel I can use it even without the moisturizer, as this product is very moisturizing.

However, at the same time, it won't leave the skin looking oily. Absorbs fast, and great to be used as a foundation under the makeup.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I never review products but I wanted to review this one. EltaMD UV clear facial sunscreen is the best facial sunscreen that I’ve ever used. I am a dark skin woman, and the cream becomes transparent when rubbed in. The sun protection is very good however you must remember to reply frequently when swimming. The best benefit of the screen is that it cured my son’s acne! My teenage son has mostly cystic acne and blackheads. I had him use this sunscreen on his face while on vacation last month and within a week I saw a drastic improvement in his skin. He’s been now using it about three weeks and his acne is almost gone. I wasn’t expecting such a benefit when I got EltaMD but I’m so glad I bought it. Sunscreen usually causes both him and I break out like crazy. Not EltaMD! He has been on benzyl peroxide and salicylic acid for at least a year and the results of eltaMD far surpass anything achieved peroxide and salicylic acid. I hope they will continue to product this provide indefinitely.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"Look no further-this is the holy grail of facial sunscreens! It doesn’t leave a cast, goes on smoothly, and is packed with safe and sensitive-skin friendly ingredients. 100% worth the price! My kids also beg me to put this on their face because it doesn’t leave them looking like a ghost!",5,One,B002MSN3QQ
"I reeeeally wanted to love this sunscreen. It was recommended by my esthetician, so I decided to purchase it. I was previously using the CeraVe Tinted Sunscreen, but wanted to switch to something that didn’t make me feel as oily. I first applied probably more than I should (two fingers worth) and I felt I had a white cast even though it promotes no white cast, so I slightly decrease the dosage, which I felt was okay. This past week, I feel like my forehead feels a bit bumpy/scaly, though you can’t see the bump. My skin has been feeling tight and dry, and I’ve started getting small dry patches around my cheeks. I looked up zinc oxide and it turns out it can be very drying to your skin depending on your skin type. In conclusion, this didn’t work for me. I’d also recommend not buying it through Amazon as it might be a counterfeit — that might have also been an issue.",2,0,B002MSN3QQ
"This sunscreen is really nice. It disappears into skin and my skin actually looks a little less red/more calm after I put it on. (I'm probably Fitzpatrick's 2 or 3). The first couple months, it reacted with other products I was using by pilling up, but I've either removed those products or my skin has balanced out. I think Niacinamide sometimes causes the problem or a moisturizer I was using with a high amount of silicone. Be sure to use enough; it's thin and goes on easily so it's easy to miss spots. :) I'm going to try the tinted version next!",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
I love this. I have used this for years. I have sensitive combo skin and this is the only sunscreen that is lightweight and doesn't break me out. It will pill if the layer you use before isn't completely dry. I find it sits well under makeup and the niacinamide helps to even out skin tone. I love this so much I recommend it to everyone who is trying facial sunscreen for the first time.,5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I've been using this sunscreen for a few weeks now. I have very acne prone skin and this hasn't caused me to break out, so I love it! The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because of the white cast it leaves. I have medium olive skine and this makes my skin appear slightly grey and pale, but it's still not as bad as most sunscreens do. If you have more fair skin, it probably won't be an issue, but deeper skin tones I probably wouldn't recomend.",4,One,B002MSN3QQ
"I've lost track of how many different sunscreens I've tried and hated over the years. Last year, i went to a new dermatologist. She asked me what sunscreen i'd used and I told her i'd given up using sunscreen because it just made my acne worse and made my face look both ghostly white and shiny like a brand new coin. I basically just wore wide brimmed hats wherever i went. Anyway, the dermatologist gave me a sample of Elta MD and told me that she thought i would like it. I tried it thinking it would be like all the others but was pleasantly surprised. I immediately bought a bottle of it after finishing the sample.

Elta MD Clear actually helps my acne! It's got niacinamide which apparently keeps acne under control. It also doesn't leave such an obvious white film on my skin. I have medium olive skin and most sunscreens leave me looking like i'm covered in chalk. There is some shine and whiteness when first applying, but it becomes more transparent and matte in 20 minutes. I sometimes use Mineral veil (BareMinerals) on top of the sunscreen to make my skin appear more matte immediately.

The only con I have found with this sunscreen is that if i put on my vitamin C serum first (I use  Ole Henriksen ), and then apply the sunscreen, the sunscreen will start to roll of my skin. If i wait 20-30 minutes after applying the vitamin C serum, and then apply Elta Md, then it's fine. But i don't really have the time for this, so i don't use my C serum as much now. If anyone is using Elta Md with another C cserum that doesn't interact this way, please let me know if the comments!

But all in all, this sunscreen is great. I use it nearly every day and wish i had found it years ago.",5,4,B002MSN3QQ
"My far the best sunscreen I have ever used. I have rosacea and had no issues with this causing more redness, burning, or stinging. It didn't burn my eyes and I was able to apply it to my eyelid and under eye area. It has no white cast and adsorbs quickly without leaving a greasy feeling on the skin. The only downside is the price but I think it's a you pay for what you get situation.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"Really liked this sunscreen at first, but after using it only 5 times the pump dispenser stopped working! I am irritated since I have almost a full tube that I can't use unless I break the top off, which will make it unhygienic & difficult to dispense. Also I was on vacation in a foreign country when it broke & had a difficult time getting replacement sunscreen. A relatively expensive product should have better quality control!",1,0,B002MSN3QQ
I love this product and have purchased numerous times. It is really nice on the skin and has never bothered my eyes. I use it daily after having some sun damage removed and have not seen sun damage return since using. I use a light mineral powder of the top as it is very moisturizing on me. I get a lot of compliments on my skin now.,5,One,B002MSN3QQ
I swear this is the only effective SPF that actually works and doesn’t break me out! I am 49 and still have small breakouts with sunscreen yet it’s vital I protect myself. I wear make up and I’m sporty so I’ve tried it all! I have to let my moisturizer fully set before applying the spf and then let this fully set before my makeup will go on properly. Clean ingredients. Love it!,5,0,B002MSN3QQ

"I used this once and absolutely loved it but when I saw other's reviews about the dangerous chemicals and the fact that it wasn't 100% mineral sunscreen I was very disappointed.

"I love this sunscreen. I have very dry, flaky, eczema prone skin and this is the best sunscreen that worked. It doesn't show my dead skin or leave a weird white cast. I can also apply makeup on top of it without ""pilling."" I love this sunscreen and it took me 4 years to find one. I am also allergic to a lot of sunscreen out there but not this.",5,One,B002MSN3QQ
"I cannot attest to the product's coverage or qualities other than the fact it has OCTINOXATE in it. If you are looking for a chemical free sunscreen, keep on looking. I unfortunately didn't see it listed. In fact, I had to comb through the product listing to find the full ingredients list. Octinoxate is known to disrupt your endrocrine system, mimicking hormones over time.",1,One,B002MSN3QQ
"So I waited a while to write this cuz I wanted to give it time. I really thought that after a week or two it would start to break me out, but that's hasn't happened. I have extremely acne prone skin, and usually sunscreen breaks me out no matter what kind it is. I'm so happy to finally have a sunscreen I can use. Also most sunscreen burns and stings my eyes. This doesn't do that either, and I put it on my eyelids and under eye area.",5,2,B002MSN3QQ
"Bought for a trip Sept 27 - Oct 7 in a a sunny location. The one bought in May worked great, this one able apply for one application and then a dribble for a partial application the next day - a REAL rip off. I contacted the company on return but they did not respond.

They need to work on getting rid of this container and use a tube - suggest you buy Avene SPF 50 instead

"This a great sunscreen for anyone who particularly cares about taking care of their skin. With the hot temperatures and particularly sunny days I have been having recently in my area, I must say it works great. I work with kids too, and during this pandemic all they want to do is play outside. So far, no sunburns so the protection is definitely there, and I definitely do not think it is clogging my pores or anything like that. Highly recommend!",5,One,B002MSN3QQ

"I have purchased this product three times and each time i have made sure it says it is CLEAR facial sunscreen. When it arrives it is tinted a light tan color!! We want to use it for the entire family on their faces but many do not want to use a tan tinted face sunscreen. It is deceptive when it says clear face sunscreen and it comes with a color. This is my one big issue.

I like the product. Just not the beige tinting.",3,0,B002MSN3QQ
Sr recommended me to get this after finding some skin cancer on my face - it’s pricey but if I put it on with a tiny bit of moisturizer it goes all over well - lasts forever for such a small bottle - I cannot stand stuff on my face and this is weightless! The slight color is like makeup but very light - great product works well and dr recommended,5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I was recommended this product for chronic sun damage from my youth to try to help reduce any further damage. It feels lighter than traditional sun screen, but I still cannot get it to disappear on my face; it leaves my face pink for about an hour or so after application. The directions state to use every couple of hours a day as the sun protection wears off, so instead a red face all day, it’s a muted whitish-pink.

I should try one of the tinted ones to see it that’s any better.",4,0,B002MSN3QQ
I am a redhead and need sunscreen every day. I live in Texas where the summers are sunny and hot! I absolutely love this sunscreen because I don't look like a ghost - covered in white zinc-based sunscreen! I've been looking for a product that keeps me from burning but goes on clear. This is the sunscreen that does all that! I have bought at least six bottles of this and will continue to buy this one for years to come!,5,One,B002MSN3QQ
No white cast. Totally sheer and moisturizing. AND DOES NOT BURN MY EYES!!!,5,2,B002MSN3QQ
"I have been using this product for over 2 years now and I keep repurchasing it. It's very light weight, not oily and never made my face break out (I have sensitive skin). I feel it gives me an excellent protection. I also like it doesn't smell. I apply it on top of my moisturizer, before my make up, and it blends in very well. The delivery was fast and easy through Amazon Prime. And mine came with the lot number and expiration date.",5,One,B002MSN3QQ

This offers great protection all day.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ

I feel, for the most part, it does it’s job, however it does clog my pores (always around the lower cheek/jaw area) I thought perhaps it was something else in my routine so I moved things around, took things out, and each time I go back to this sunscreen I get the breakouts/clogged pores.",3,0,B002MSN3QQ
"Best facial sunscreen I’ve used. Almost all sunscreens burn my face and cause cystic acne, even natural all mineral sunscreens. Then I saw a YouTuber mention this was calming and won’t cause acne. Very true statement. No burning, no acne, my face felt moisturized all day which is a miracle considering how dry my skin is. Looks perfect under foundation. I’m so glad I ordered this product. Will now put it in auto ship",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"When I first reviewed this product, I said I didn't like it because it dried my skin out and didn't absorb well, so it was flaky and peely. I'm editing/rewriting my review because I gave it another shot and I use it every day now - but it's still a little tricky.

What I mean is, I had to change other parts of my skincare routine to make this work. I can't use this over just any moisturizer - I had to give up my favorite moisturizer because I realized that the combo with this sunscreen was causing the flaking/peeling. After some experimenting, I found that I can only use a gel moisturizer (Clinique and Garnier both have them), and to combat the drying out (and to make up for the fact that my daytime moisturizer is lighter now), I started using a much heavier night cream. And, I can't explain this, but it seems like the flaking/peeling problem is worse the less of the sunscreen I use (for example, toward the bottom of my neck where my application is a bit lighter, I still get some peeling from time to time). It's a bit greasy - about what I would expect from any sunscreen, but worth noting because the description kind of sounds like it wouldn't be. I let it sink in as long as I can wait, and then right before I have to leave the house I have to put something else on to combat the greasiness, like a powder or a BB cream with primer.

But I've made all these changes because I really do like what the sunscreen offers - high-ish SPF, broad spectrum, and transparent Zinc Oxide.",3,One,B002MSN3QQ

My skin is also so sensitive and I’ll breakout with anything new but if anything, this product has made my skin SO MUCH BETTER.

"Works well, stays put, and doesn't leave a heavy white cast (I am very pale, though, so anyone with darker skin may have a different experience). Plays well with my mild rosacea and cruelty free is also a plus.The only thing I don't like about it is that it dries VERY shiny. Not a problem if I'm wearing it under makeup, but otherwise I have to dust it with setting powder so I don't look like an oil slick. I""ll be trying out the Japanese Biore Face Milk sunscreen next to see if it works better for me.",4,5,B002MSN3QQ

Love this product. I've used it in the tinted and clear formula. I have REALLY sensitive skin and have used this for 3 years. No breakouts. No redness.

"I bought this since it was recommended by Curology for acne-prone skin. My first impression was that I loved how thin the consistency was compared to other facial sunscreens. However, the first time I used it I got about 6-7 cystic acne bumps pop up literally over night.

The ingredients in this are great.",5,2,B002MSN3QQ
"If this product was water-resistant, I would give it 5 out of 5 stars. I have really sensitive skin and break out easily from sunscreen and most moisturizers. This sunscreen (although, I've only used it twice) seems perfect for my face. But, it really doesn't do me any good if I plan to go in the hot sun. This sunscreen is NOT water resistant and will not provide coverage if you sweat or get wet :-( I don't believe they make a facial sunscreen for acne prone skin that is water-resistant, which is very disappointing. Perhaps it is the water-resistant ingredient that irritates acne prone skin. Who knows? I guess if you use a daily sunscreen for running errands, etc. this is worth the expense. Unfortunately, I work from home and really only wear sunscreen when I'm hiking or by the pool. Prior to finding this sunscreen, I used Elta MD's UV Physical Broad-Spectrum SPF 41 Sensitive Skin facial sunscreen (purchased from my dermatologist). That is an awesome product and goes on like a concealer or foundation, but makes my skin breakout. Needless to say, my facial sunscreen search continues....",4,One,B002MSN3QQ

"Pros: Has UVA & UVB coverage with high SPF.
Cons: I am pretty sensitive to the sent of traditional sunscreen so I do not like the scent of this product. Thankfully the smell goes away as it dries but still, putting it on is no fun. Also, this product has caused some minor breakouts/bumps for me. The biggest problem that I have with this product is that it pills when I rub in the product so I end up with little flakes of product everywhere. I use the product by patting it into my face but if I put makeup over it, I will still have the same pilling problem. In the end this prevents me from wanting to use the product.",2,0,B002MSN3QQ
"This is the creamiest and smoothest sunscreen. It feels like icing and goes on so smoothly with no stinky odor.

This sunscreen is great for rosacea. The sun can make your rosacea flare and sunscreen is very important. I don't like the feel of sunscreen so I struggle with it but this is very light and feels nothing like sunscreen. I first bought it at my dermatologist he highly recommended it.

Unfortunate, since it was 33$ that I probably won't get back.",1,2,B002MSN3QQ
"I was really disappointed in this product. I bought it based on my dermatologist's recommendation to prevent/improve melasma and it went on nicely.

I tried to just use it on my forehead and then my eyebrows started getting dry and flaky and it took days to get it to go away. I can only wear it when I go out in the sun and then have to make sure I scrub it off right after, which defeats the purpose of using it as a daily moisturizer. Maybe I didn't wash it off well enough initially but I don't really want to worry about this problem as it's really unsightly.",3,0,B002MSN3QQ

I was pleasantly surprised when I applied it and found it light, creamy and not even a tiny bit sticky! It even smells good! I test drove it all afternoon, grocery shopping, cooking over a hot stove and I felt perfect! Not sure how the SPF is on me yet but I can definitely tolerate this stuff! If my sweaty face can stand it, I’m positive you can to!",4,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I absolutely love this sunscreen for the face. I will never use another face sunscreen again! My dermatologist recommended this sunscreen for me since I have oily, acne prone skin and I love it cause it doesn't cause acne or make it worse. The sunscreen has 5% niacinamide which is shown in studies to help heal acne/hyperpigmentation after acne. It may cause a little redness at first but this goes away after a few minutes. I have also noticed it may appear greasy/shinny/maybe a little white cast at first but once it soaks into the skin it is clear. I always dust a little powder on my face to take care of any shine and to even out my skin tone cause I can't go makeup free. It feels light, not heavy like other sunscreens. For some these factors may be deal breakers as some may seek matte finish sunscreens but the benefits of this sunscreen are worth it. It's fragrance-free, oil-free, paraben-free, non-comedogenic, and perfect for sensitive skin/acne prone skin.

Sunscreen is so important and especially if you don't want any hyperpigmentation getting darker. I am on tretnoin (retin-a) so sunscreen is a must!

Buy it, try it, and I doubt you will be disappointed.",5,2,B002MSN3QQ

"I wish I didn't love this stuff as the price tag is high for the amount of sunscreen you actually get. Why am I such a hopeless addict to the Eltamd UV Clear SPF 46? Let me explain.

I'm 27 and have oily, acne-prone skin. It's calmed down recently but I started using this sunscreen two years ago when I had a lot more break outs. I have had HORRIBLE breakouts when using sunscreen, everything from drug store to high end. I'm talking cystic acne that leaves scars behind. You can imagine that I was reticent to try a new kind but my mom thought the ingredients looked good and recommended it to me after getting a sample. Since I'm from the South and spend time in Central America, I know that a sunscreen is a daily necessity.

First, let's talk about the texture. This sunscreen goes on fairly sheer. However, realize that it is not formulated like most chemical sunscreens so you might have to work to rub it in a bit. It will look shiny on your skin and then settles down a bit. It actually feels nice on your skin and doesn't smell as strong as some sunscreens.

I find that my makeup applies nicely as long as I wait about 2 minutes for it to settle in. You might look a bit ghostly in pictures so keep that in mind. Now, here's why I'm so in love: It makes your skin look better! Seriously! I can tell a difference in my skin when I run out of this stuff within a few days. It gets drier and bumpier and the fine lines around my eyes and forehead show up more easily.

Oh, and I've never gotten burned while using this stuff. Even in super sunny Costa Rican weather.

So, while I would love Eltamd to make a bigger bottle of this stuff and at least offer a small discount, I'm hooked. If you've had trouble with sunscreens, give this stuff a try.",5,2,B002MSN3QQ
"I purchased this because I have acne prone skin, but also because it is supposedly clear. Not so much. I have a somewhat dark complexion. I don't wear makeup. After putting this on, I have a gray cast to my face that can't be ignored. I truly wish that I could find a good sunblock that doesn't turn me gray.",2,0,B002MSN3QQ
"This is very emollient, spread-able sunscreen. Comes out white, applied clear. I like that one pump dispensing about 1/4 teaspoon of product which is the recommended amount for the face. But this did not sit well under my Estée Lauder Double Wear. I got patchy dots all over my skin where it separated. Not cute. And my previous sunscreens didn’t render that result. I’ll be using this on my next and chest from now on.",4,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I have super sensitive acne prone skin, as well as super dry/combination skin. I am amazed that this product didn’t break me out! I wish it were a little more hydrating but something is better than nothing! And spf is a must so I do like this product. I have medium skin and I do notice a white cast if I forget to rub it in well enough",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
I am an archaeologist and work outdoors often. I like this sunscreen very much because it doesn't leave you greasy and it blends in quickly. There is no odor and I have not experienced any running of sunscreen into my eyes. I am careful to apply in the morning before heading out into the sun and I don't get sunburnt throughout the day. We were given a bottle as a gift from the company and I liked it so much I bought some more once I ran out.,5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"The bottle was terrible. It arrived leaking (not a good package design for delivery to different climates, apparently) and it never worked right after that. Some days, I would pump and pump and nothing would come out, then the next day it would work again. The product is fine, but I'm giving it a very low rating because for a price like that there shouldn't be any struggle to get the product out of its packaging. I was rather relieved when I finally ran out. Then again, I'm not sure if I ran out or if the bottle just stopped pumping permanently. :/",1,4,B002MSN3QQ
"I’d been wanting to try this sunscreen for awhile now mainly for its suitability for rosacea sufferers. It offers great sun protection and seems to diminish redness I have associated with rosacea. However, it gets dry and flaky as the day goes on. I’ve been trying with a moisturizer as a first layer and waiting to apply, but it is still a little drying.",4,0,B002MSN3QQ
"My mom’s derm recommended it and I decided to give it a try. It’s moisturizing, non-greasy, and absorbs quickly. This is my second purchase and I’m happy with it. Keep in mind that if you’re going into the sun, you need to reapply at least every few hours, just as with all other sunblocks",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"This is the best mineral-based sunscreen I've tried. I've been on the hunt forever and have tried so many mineral sunscreens that I always end up hating. I have olive skin and am always left with a pasty white face. This is super lightweight and goes on nicely, leaving me with minimal to no white cast. I've had trouble with pilling and my skin ends up a little flaky/crusty at the end of the day (I have dry skin). The pilling might be due to other products I use under (hyaluronic acid to combat dryness). Overall, great mineral sunscreen with minimal cast and fragrance.",4,One,B002MSN3QQ
"Being an ultra pale sort I'm always on the lookout for a fantastic daily sunscreen and after seeing all the rave reviews I was hoping that this might be it. For the record - I have dry skin (upgraded to incredibly dry during the winter) - so I'm not exactly the target demographic for this sunscreen. Having dry skin my main concern with this product was that it would leave my skin unbearably dry and tight feeling throughout the day - but boy was I ever wrong. On my skin this sunscreen never really dried down or absorbed into my skin - it just remained greasy and slick, sitting ontop of my skin. With or without a makeup primer my foundation had rubbed off of my face before the middle of the day and by the end of the day I would have apparent oily patches on my forehead and nose (I have dry skin and it's the middle of this polar vortex winter!).

This product clearly works very well for many people, but if it just isn't working right for you there are many other fantastic products on the market. Shiseido's Urban Environment line happens to work very well for my skin (although it's too perfume-y for my taste) and behaves nicely with my makeup.",3,4,B002MSN3QQ
"This is a great product that I really believe has protected my skin from the sun. I'm 37 and I've tried many of the cheap drugstore brands (like Neutrogena) and more expensive department store brands (like clinique and Shiseido). This one combines the best features-- effectiveness in minimizing lines, provision of moisture, sun protection, light feel, no breakouts. I've used this for 2 years (after realizing that my Clinique product had been rubbing off and allowing sun through on certain parts of my face causing freckles and sunspots). I do believe that the user must take care to not rub her face or otherwise remove the sunscreen as she is applying blush, powder, or other makeup. If you DO apply powder over this sunscreen, I would make sure that it has SPF as well since you might be rubbing this sunscreen of as you apply your power (if you're not careful). But if you are committed to using it correctly, I do believe that this product will provide great sun protection. I really like that it does not feel sticky or greasy like almost every other sunscreen. I sorta feel like I should send a sample to all my female friends who refuse to wear facial unscreen because they say it feels disgusting to them.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I have tried alot of sunscreens and this is by far the best I have ever used under my makeup. I am on the dryer side and this sunscreen is great, not greasy at all. Makes my makeup look flawless and I can even add it on top of my makeup later in the day and it just absorbs perfectly!",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I've always had problems with breakouts on my face and chest with sunscreen, and I'll admit to poor compliance using sunscreen because of this. I've tried all the drugstore ""facial/sensative"" skin types and spent tons on Clinique, Clarins and even l'occitane, they all caused terrible breakouts! I did some research before my beach trip and found rave reviews on this, EltA MD. It's a mineral sunscreen with niacinamide and zinc oxide. It doesn't leave white residual and didn't feel heavy or greasy. I used it 4 days in a row and NO BREAKOUTS! My new favorite product and I had to share!",5,2,B002MSN3QQ
"Pills with several types of moisturizers so I’m still trying to find the right combination and unsure I will continue purchasing this. I have mostly oily skin but get dry on my chin. I think it does a good job of oil control but I’m always left with some little white pills in my eyelids and in my neck creases, or where I touch my face. Rubs in beautifully, though!",4,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I have always hated slathering sunscreen on my face - I used La Roche Posay for quite a while and really liked it, but my dermatologist recommended Elta for me. I have rosacea, sensitive skin and lots of hyperpigmentation on my cheeks, neck and upper chest. It is imperative that I use a good sunscreen every day to help fade the pigmentation problem and to protect from further damage. I absolutely LOVE this sunscreen. It feels a bit like a moisturizer, which I usually hate, but it is not greasy and it dries really quickly. I am thrilled to be able to use this under foundation, which always felt too heavy before. I am so happy with it that I signed up for automatic delivery on Amazon to make sure I never run out.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I have very sensitive skin. My derm didn’t recommend me to use this, but I like to try. I had tried many drug store brand and all irritated my skin. This sunscreen is very light, not oilly, not sticky, and work well with make up. I need to clean my face with micelle water(Bioderma) before cleanser(Cetaphil) since it feels like water resistant.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I have used this sunscreen for several years after buying it at my dermatologists office. I love it. She also recommended neutrogena and I used it but it was too greasy. I have oily, acne prone skin and this is very lightweight and provides good sun protection without clogging my pores or feeling greasy.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"Bought this product based on other reviews, but I’m not impressed. It does not layer well as it “beads up” when trying to put any other product on top of it. Moisturizer is meant to be worn under makeup, but can’t because if the beading problem.",1,One,B002MSN3QQ
"This product is insane. I have never in my life had a sunscreen that didn't break me out without leaving a horrible, strong white cast on my face. I am pale, but even I can't pull that off. And finding a sunscreen that matches that description that also plays nice with makeup over it? Ha, good luck. But this product does all of that, and I can't believe it. Zero extra shine, my foundation doesn't separate or look weird, and no white cast. It also absorbs quickly; I just apply it, do my eyebrows, and then I'm ready for foundation. This is a sunscreen I will actually use every day because it is a zero compromise product, and that's a huge deal.",5,2,B002MSN3QQ
The one I ordered from the description is SPF 46 for acne prone skin. The item I received is SPF 40 and doesn't have the same label as the bottle advertised.,1,One,B002MSN3QQ
"I bought this after recommendations by a dermatologist. I prefer a one step product if possible - combination of moisturizer and spf protection. I have normal, non-acne skin. Unfortunately, this product was a bit drying and did not provide any moisture; it worked best with a moisturizer applied first - then applying this cream. Also I noticed that if I did not wear a moisturizer, this cream would not be completely clear and my face would have a whitish hew. A couple hours after application, I would also see whitish areas on the cheeks. Probably because of the lack of moisturizer leading to some flaking? I am going to try EltaMDs other product (EltaMD UV Daily SPF 40) as that one lists that it has hydrating ingredients to provide better moisturization. I would not recommend this particular product in the line for normal or dry skin.",3,One,B002MSN3QQ
"I have fairly normal skin but get occasional breakouts if the product I use is oily. This sunscreen is very light and I like that it's just a straight up sunscreen, nothing else. I put it on after I've done my morning moisturizer and it lasts a long time. I recently went on an island vacation and it was perfect for every day use there (I use it every day normally anyway!). Really good stuff and I'll definitely buy again!",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"Recommended by my dermatologist, very happy with product.",5,2,B002MSN3QQ
"The last sunscreen I used make my face super oily in the t-zone area. So I went on a quest to find a reliable sunscreen. So this might be my only sunscreen for my face I’ll ever need. It doesn’t make my face oily or break out or leave a white cast. Also, the ingredients are pretty much malassezia folliculitis safe",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
I usually can’t tolerate the feel of a mineral sunscreen but this one goes on light and doesn’t leave a white film. Perfect for after skin care and under make up. Will definitely reorder.,4,One,B002MSN3QQ
"It was important that I get a sunscreen that didn’t smell because my girlfriend hates the smell of sunscreen. She likes when I wear this one. Hardly any smell at all. Definitely not your typical sunscreen-y smell.
Doesn’t feel like much on the skin. Not dry or crumbly. Feels kind of like moisturizer. Rubs in clear. No white",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
Doesn’t make me break out. Makeup goes smoothly on top of it. It feels very moisturizing too which is nice for this old lady. My only wish was that it was a little cheaper or the bottle was bigger. I go through so much.,5,One,B002MSN3QQ
"I have acne prone skin and have tried so many sunscreens that have broken me out... Not this one. I love how this is a neutral sunscreen, with no real smell and doesn't clog my pores. Some say it's a little greasy, but I find it fine especially when I put a little makeup on after. It kind of gives skin that dewey look. Now that I'm older I'm always investing in my skincare products and this one is worth it.",5,One,B002MSN3QQ
First of all this is the real product which is a good thing... Next of all this is the best sunscreen I've ever used in my life... Not only are there right agents in it but this moisturizing my skin beautifully and wears perfectly under my Mac Studio fix fluid foundation... It is fabulous,5,One,B002MSN3QQ
"So far I am loving this sunscreen. I have tried at least a dozen or more others and have not liked a single one of them for one reason or another. I can't say for certain that it's my HG but it's certainly close. It dispenses by an easily controllable pump. Though it is white when dispensed and when first applied, as you gently rub it in it becomes clear and sinks into your skin. It leaves no white cast or residue. After allowing it to settle in a bit, I sometimes add a bit of primer mixed with a drop of Cover FX unless I need to go someplace special (which never happens). That gives me the sun protection necessary for my lupus and a bit of a finished look for being at home and not scaring the dog. Granted I do take special precautions to limit my sun exposure but this sunscreen does seem to do a good job without all the draw backs usually associated with similar products. I'm pleased with it.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I decided to try this sunscreen after seeing many recommendations on several fashion bloggers that I follow. They all swear by its amazing quality and how it does not cause skin breakouts. And I totally agree. This is one great quality product that works very good on my sensitive skin, offers great sun protection and it is moisturizing.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"EltaMD UV CLEAR is a great Broad Spectrum SPF for sensitive skin. Doesn't irritate my skin like a lot of sunscreens and sunblock products. Very effective at preventing sun damage, redness and melasma. ***I also use the EltaMD tinted version which is fabulous at evening out skin tone. I use the tinted product in place of base makeup and LOVE IT!!! Will definitely be purchasing MORE.",4,4,B002MSN3QQ
"This was recommended by my dermotologist as a non-pore-clogging SPF for daily wear. It is very light and you only need to use a very small amount. I can't be sure about the coverage, but I do know that I do not break out like I do when I put other sunscreens on my face - even ones designed for face.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
So I was on a hunt for the perfect sunscreen and I came across this one on tik tok that this one lady recommended. This is a NEED in skin care routine. If you are going to use anything use this! Not only does this help against skin cancer but it also helps with preventing wrinkles and blemishes. I love this stuff! It does not leave a white cast on my skin. It is very moisturizing and not oily.,5,One,B002MSN3QQ
"I love the EltaMD line of mineral sunscreen products. They are the lightest weight sunscreens I have found and soak in well. They are not thick or goopy so they go on smoothly and work great under makeup. i prefer the non-tinted version because I use it on my arms, hands and back of my neck. I have found the tinted one will get color on my clothes so I have to be careful where I put it. The only drawback is the price. But with this, you get what you pay for.",5,3,B002MSN3QQ
I have acne prone skin and suffer from hyperpigmentation. This wears beautifully under makeup. Does not leave a white cast. I read great reviews on this here and various skin boards and had to try for myself. I just repurchased my 2nd bottle. It has not caused any breakouts and was everything I was looking for in a sunscreen.,5,4,B002MSN3QQ
"Holy cow I have never found a sunscreen as much as I love this one! No thick white film! This rubs in SUPER easy, works fantastic (no burns for me yet!), hasn’t triggered any breakouts from my crazy congestion prone skin, and helps keep my skin moisturized! I really cannot go without this stuff. If you’ve been looking for the perfect face sunscreen then this is it!",5,One,B002MSN3QQ
I usually order my ELTA MD sunscreen from derm store but needed it ASAP so I tried Amazon. Ordered both UV clear and the tinted one. Tinted one broke me out within a day. UV clear I ordered from Amazon has a different scent and consistency than my usual Uv clear. Hoping it’s legit.,3,0,B002MSN3QQ
I have sensitive skin and thought it was great but as the day go goes by I think I had slight irration. Not sure if it’s because I put my moisturizer then this product or not sure if I should wear this product alone. It’s definitely lightweight for a sunscreen,4,One,B002MSN3QQ
"I've been using EltaMD sunscreen for years. Excellent product. On April 3, 2021, I ordered 6 new containers of product from Amazon. On April 4, 2021, I received 2 containers of labeled ""Tester"" product and 4 regular containers. $36+ per container presumably for new product, and I receive 2/6 containers of ""tester"" product. See photos. I am expecting reimbursement or new product.",1,One,B002MSN3QQ
"This is the least noticeable sunscreen I've used. It's hard to find one that isn't shiny, or chalky. It melts in like a good lotion, and it actually has some well-known ingredients found in the nicer moisturizers. Whether or not any of those ingredients do anything, I have no idea, but some appear more respected than others, niacinamide being one, which allegedly mitigates pigment production.

I feel like I've noticed improvement in my skin, but this isn't the only product I've been using so it's hard to say. It's the face product I've been using most consistently though, every day for over a month, so.. Really, it's worth it to me for being free of most controversial chemicals and having some popular ones in it. If that's psychological, so be it.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I’ve used this for 5-6 years. Absorbs well into the skin, doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin or cause blemishes, and works well under makeup. It has UVA and UVB protection. Product has a pump dispenser, and it cannot be left in the heat or the plug at the bottom disintegrates, causing the not to work anymore. Good sized bottle. EltaMD makes a clear formulation, too, but it is much more expensive, so I stick with this one.",5,One,B002MSN3QQ
"i had adult acne strike in my mid-20's. a dermo recommended this brand and now its the only one i trust with my skin. i apply to my face, tops of shoulders, chest and upper back - areas that are prone to acne. this is my face SPF go to. love it.",5,One,B002MSN3QQ
Living in florida where sunscreen is a must! Been using this spf for about 1yr now. It lasts forever. Little amout goes long way. I dont have oily skin but i breakout from other spf.. this does not make me breakout. Its super light goes on clear and u have a natural glow. You r not going to regret it.,5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I am 27 and have dealed with moderate face & back acne since I was 13. My acne cleared up from age 24-26 and now I have adult hormonal acne (I just can't seem to catch a break!). My dermatologist advised me to use a sunscreen even though I am a tan Asian that never burns, and I did some Googling and found this sunscreen. I decided what do I have to lose and with Amazon Prime I would get it in two days to try. I'm glad I did. My skin has improved and unlike other sunscreen my face isn't as oily as it would normally be. It def is a peace of mind knowing that I'm protecting my skin and it's helping my acne. Love it, recommend it, will repurchase again.

But I do want to know, why the hell is the 3.4oz size more than triple the price of the 1.7oz?!",5,3,B002MSN3QQ
I got this sunscreen after seeing it recommended online by a dermatologist. I totally love it! And it works really great under makeup. I love the consistency of it and everything. One pump is the perfect amount for the face. Will definitely continue to buy this.,5,0,B002MSN3QQ
I bought this product because I've been searching far and wide for a sunscreen for my sensitive face that won't cling to the dry skin around my mouth and nose. I thought I had found it. Until it sweated off and I got quite sunburned. What good is this if I have to also put a water/sweat resistant sunscreen over top? No thanks. I'll keep searching.,3,0,B002MSN3QQ
"My dermatologist recommended this. Works great, doesn’t feel or smell like sunscreen. Very light with neural smell. Doesn’t clog pores. A bit pricy compared to other brands, though, but I use it daily and seems to last awhile.",4,One,B002MSN3QQ
Been using Tretonoin as an anti-aging cream and it peels skin (as expected) so I heard to buy this stuff to protect me from sun during the day. It doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin that’s become even more sensitive since using my anti-aging Rx so I am happy with the results this sunscreen provides me.,5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"It is my Only facial sunscreen since it came on the market: it gives fantastic protection, non-greasy and does not stain clothes. I have extremly oily skin that cannot tolerate so many otherwise good products but never had breakouts after months of using the Elta UV Sunscreen. Just apply 15-20 min before going out and re-apply as needed.",5,One,B002MSN3QQ
"I'm fair skinned and only go out before 10 or after 2 with a hat on. I've still been getting burned with this piled on! I'm so disgusted that I spent so much to buy this. Wish I could get my money back to buy something else, but didn't get to try it in a timely manner.",1,0,B002MSN3QQ
"Sunscreen tends to irritate my skin but this stuff doesn’t. It does go on a little pale when you initially apply it, given that it’s a mineral sunscreen, but not noticeably so. I can’t speak to its moisturizing capabilities since I apply it over my regular moisturizer. Overall I’m very pleased and I chose this product after a lot of research.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
Someone wrote a review saying that this was a knock off... via the date. I didn't buy it worried. Then a few weeks later I was like WTH... bought it. Has the date on the bottom. Not sure if it's a knock off but it works great. Everything I use EXCEPT this product gives me massive zits on my face and neck. THIS DOES NOT.,5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I have been using this product for about 2 years now and I was happy to find it a few dollars cheaper on Amazon. I am 45 years old and still suffer occasional acne and I also have Melasma which is when patches of dark skin appear on areas of the face exposed to the sun - and no you do not have to be pregnant for this is occur. I have an olive complexion but the dark patches are so ugly. I go get laser treatment to remove them and this sunscreen really helps to prevent dark patches from reoccurring without clogging my pores. I would highly recommend this to anyone who still breaks out but wants to protect their face from the sun. I use it on my clean skin and follow with my regular skincare regiment and then my makeup. It is a pain to have to put so many layers on each day, but I know that I do not look as old as others my age and I love activities outdoors making sunscreen a must. I hope it continues to work for me as it is the best thing I have found and believe me I have tried a lot of products.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ

"I obsess about sunscreen, and I am completely satisfied with this one. I have sensitive skin and I burn really easily. It lasts a lot longer than anything else I've used. It FEELS good going on. No shine, residue, or sting. I use moisturizer on top of it, then makeup. I am going to keep buying it and that is extremely high praise from me. Absolutely great.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I have been using this product for years with no problems. I use the tinted version, which evens my skin tone but makes my skin look very oily. This oiliness is new. It has happened with the last two bottles purchased here. Gives a moderate sunscreen...I have to apply it frequently, especially outdoors. The new bottles made my eyes burn terribly. I couldn't figure out what was going on until I saw my eye doctor and he said I was having an allergic reaction to something getting into my eyes, not a seasonal allergy problem. I live in the south and love the outdoors, so I sweat a lot. My dermatologist recommended this sunscreen, but I think I'm going to ask about an alternative. Something has changed in the formulation, and it is not an improvement. You can see my red eyes and increased bags from the reaction.",1,One,B002MSN3QQ
Not greasy. Doesn't make me breakout. Works great under make up. Doesnt look white when rubbed in. Will be using this for a long time.,5,One,B002MSN3QQ
"Balanced my oily skin and moisturized dry areas. Created a lovely natural look or a great base for most makeup. Doesn't sting eyes, so I can use it fairly close. I thew away all my chemical sunscreen and use only this brand and a powdered zinc sunscreen. A real BB cream.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
I have acne prone skin & this is by far the best sunscreen I’ve ever used. My dermatologist recommended this to me (along with a handful of my friends that use this) and I couldn’t be happier. It does NOT break me out in the least & is very lightweight.,5,0,B002MSN3QQ
I wanted to like this so much after reading the reviews- however it stung when I applied it and broke me out in a splotchy rash each time I put it on. I don’t have sensitive skin so I’m not sure what the issue is. It is very moisturizing and applied great but I just can’t use it.,1,0,B002MSN3QQ
Im sensitive to facial products a lot. Like tis sunblock. Does not irritate my eyes when i accidentaly smear one to my eye,5,One,B002MSN3QQ
"First off, I've never gotten a sunburn using this stuff, so it does its job.

It goes on clear as advertised and is lightweight but at the same time packs a pretty good SPF punch. Typically when I've used facial moisturizer/sunscreen combos above SPF 15 I've found the texture to be too thick/tacky for my liking. This is great in that it soaks right in and therefore doesn't deter me from using a higher SPF in my daily routine, which is important as my job requires me to be outside a lot.

I've found though that when using this sunscreen in conjunction with certain other moisturizers or serums it will not sink in but rather pill up in little white balls. Not a huge issue for me - I just wash my face and start over using a different product with the sunscreen. I currently use it mixed with a moisturizer - one squirt of SPF, one squirt of moisturizer, give it a quick rub between my hands to mix and then pat it on my face. Makes my morning routine easy peasy!",4,0,B002MSN3QQ
"This product is a great sunscreen!! Has not made me break out, however I have felt oily on the days I use it and constantly get whiffs of sunscreen throughout the day. I do use it over my face lotion (as dermatologist recommended), but it makes me feel like my face is cakey and gross.",4,0,B002MSN3QQ
"My dermo recommended this stuff to me. I don't want to say I have rosacea (I do!) or acne (I have that, too!), but my dermo thought this sun screen/ face moisturizer would work for me and it has! I've been using it for over two years and whenever I run out and revert to my store brand, I break out something bad! This stuff goes on smooth, absorbs, and gives me less shine throughout the day. The bottle last a good while--I'm careful to push the pump once or twice to make it last, but it is without a doubt worth it!

Oh, and my dermo charges twice what Amazon does.
Dropping from 5 to 3 stars:
***update 11/16 - last order I received the product was yellowish instead of white. I'm not sure if it's a bad batch or an imposter, but either way I'm disappointed. I've heard the company doesn't recommend buying from Amazon.",3,2,B002MSN3QQ
I have used this product for 3 years and just found out that the Octinoxate is a hormone disruptor. I already have my hormones going through changes and I stopped using this product for this reason. I will call 800 number and suggest it to them to take it out and just keep the zinc oxide. Otherwise I like using this sunscreen.,3,One,B002MSN3QQ

"I am beyond upset. This is an expensive sunscreen, which I love. I tried to use my bottle many times and nothing came out. Pump is acting like something it’s coming but nothing.

"I do not have sensitive skin and this product has me in misery after one application. It caused a rash and it feels like my entire face and neck has a chemical burn...dry, red, burning, slight itch and a general feeling of tenderness. I was not in the sun but was attempting to find a light sunscreen for daily use. I used it Thursday and it is now Saturday evening and my face actually feels like it is getting worse. I have never in my life experienced this after using a skincare or sunscreen product. Unbelievably disappointed.",1,0,B002MSN3QQ
Best sunscreen out there for acne prone skin like mine. I’ve been using this for over 8 years. The best,5,One,B002MSN3QQ
This product and company are reliable. The product works great to protect your skin from the sun.,5,One,B002MSN3QQ
"I love this product. I am obsessed with sun care, but I hate the greasy heavy feeling of sunscreen on my face. This is light, moisturizing and non-greasy. It feels like an ordinary moisturizer and not a sunscreen.

I am in my mid-40s, have combination skin.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
My dermatologist recommended and it's been great so far! I have sensitive skin and I'm acne prone so this has been working great for me!,5,2,B002MSN3QQ
"I’ve never been one to apply sunscreen everyday and that’s mainly attributed to the fact that I haven’t found one I enjoy using. This product changed the game for me! It blends into the skin nicely and also offers other skincare benefits. I gave it 4 stars and not 5 because I have very dry skin and I find that it could be a bit more moisturizing. Otherwise, I will definitely continue to repurchase!",4,One,B002MSN3QQ
Heavy sunscreen smell and feel. Incredibly hard to spread on oily skin resulting in smeared sunscreen. Really disappointed that I paid so much for a sunscreen that I can't even apply to my face. They need to change the ingredients in this product. I would not recommend this to people who have acne prone skin and oily skin.,1,One,B002MSN3QQ
"I’m sure this is amazing but it broke me out. That doesn’t speak for the product though, I have the most sensitive skin in the universe and break out from a lot of things. It was very moisturizing so I liked that about it. Give it a try and I’m sure you will love it.",3,0,B002MSN3QQ
This is the holy grail of sunscreen. My dermatologist swears by this and I got my whole family hooked! It’s not oily and is easy to spread and use daily. Even my dad will wear it (and he is picky). I also have super sensitive skin and have had no issues!,5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I bought this because it is touted as highly recommended for sensitive skin and redness. However, I had a terrible reaction to it. The second day I put it on, my face immediately felt itchy and hot and raw, like a sunburn. It took a good week or so for it to heal. I patch tested this on my arm and thigh and had no reaction, but after my face calmed down, I patched it behind my ear and showed irritation within 24 hours. Maybe it doesn't play nice with a different product I use but either way, I'll be giving it to a family member who can use it.",2,0,B002MSN3QQ
So good I've turned my whole family onto this brand. Wouldn't recommend another facial sunscreen if my life depended on it.,5,One,B002MSN3QQ
"It’s the best sunscreen cream I have ever used. Light texture, matte, leaves the skin smooth and ready for the make up.
It’s literally my 5th or more bottle. Stick with it. Can’t leave the house without it no matter if it’s a winter or a summer.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I woke up with four giant under the skin type zits on my chin from just using this once! Tried Neutrogena Clear Face 30 spf and haven't had one single breakout. Usually ""you get what you pay for"" holds true but not in this case! The much cheaper Neutrogena works waaaay better for me.",1,One,B002MSN3QQ
"This is hands down the best sunscreen. I have dry, acne prone and sensitive skin. This product instantly blended into my skin and left ZERO cast! Also, it was very moisturizing and left a nice a nice glow on my skin. It did not burn/ sting. This is a game changer, I’m in love!!",5,One,B002MSN3QQ
"I have oily, extremely sensitive skin and a lot of products cause hyperpigmentation, including certain sunscreen. My dermatologist recommended this and it has worked extremely well. No hyperpigmentation, no breakouts and no white film! A little goes a long way!",5,One,B002MSN3QQ
"I have acne-prone skin and rarely leave reviews. I have to say that for someone who generally hates wearing sunscreen, wearing this has never felt like I was wearing sunscreen. It makes it far more enjoyable for me to apply this every day. No noticeable or unpleasant scent either. Buy it! I'm a believer.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
What I like about this product is how smooth it feels when you apply it on my skin. It’s very close to a moisturizer feel and leaving a very thin layer of white cast. The down side is it is hard to put on a second layer because you will rub off the first layer.,3,0,B002MSN3QQ
"My dermatologist told me about this sunscreen it is good for acne prone skin, I use most all the sunscreen out there very expensive to cheap nothing works I always break out . It is a few days I use it no break out yet that is great news , after I put on my face my face doesn’t have s white mask thank god",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
I am a firm believer in wearing sunscreen everyday not only for skin protection but for anti-aging. This product is beautiful. Silky smooth and spreads easily with no white sheen or residue (great bonus for such a high SPF). I love the pump. Very little fragrance. Added bonus of Niacinamide (Vitamin B3) which is 'must have' ingredient has part of any skincare routine. I will be buying this again.,5,One,B002MSN3QQ
"Dr. Dray from YouTube suggested this item and it has changed my life! As someone who has suffered from rosacea the Elta skincare line is the holy grail of moisturizer and sunscreen for me! Finally, I have clear, non irritated skin. I wish it was slightly more affordable as I go through a lot (am, sunscreen, and pm moisturizer) but my skin has never looked better or healthier. So, glad I found this sunscreen and it’s all because of Dr. Dray! You must give this stuff a try.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
Im brown skinned and this did leave a white cast. Not sure how to avoid that but I dont like this aspect.,3,One,B002MSN3QQ
"I was recently diagnosed with mild rosacea and needed a good daily sunscreen. After just a few days of using this, my cheeks became irritated, rough, dry and scaly, and the rest of my face was just dry. I've stopped using it and my skin is just about back to normal a week later. My skin is normally quite oily- I've never had a reaction like this to a lotion. From reading the rest of the reviews it sounds like some people react poorly to the niacinamide. I'll steer clear of it in the future. I'm now using a moisturizer with SPF from Juice Beauty and it's awesome!",1,3,B002MSN3QQ
"This is a SAFE sunscreen that is non toxic as others are. It goes on smoothly, feels good on the skin and does not shine or leave white areas. It is sold in dermatologists' offices and is a high-quality product and worth every penny.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I havent used this in major sun but it does seem to work in that regard. It feels really gross on ny skin and leves a nasty film. Also, on several occasions Ive rubbed my face hours later and accidentally gotten it in my eyes and it burns like mad. For this price I say its a hard pass.",1,0,B002MSN3QQ
This has done WONDERS for my extremely sensitive skin. It goes on smoothly and moisturizes.,5,One,B002MSN3QQ
"I have researched facial sunscreens high and low to find one that is not greasy feeling, not heavily fragranced, and made with safe ingredients. This scores a 2 on the Environmental Working Group's safety rating (on a scale of 0 to 10, 10 being the worst). I really like this sunscreen and it does all of the things the previous reviewers say. Does not clog pores, is good for oilier skin, does not feel greasy, etc. It feels good on the face, as if you are not wearing sunscreen at all. The ONLY issue for me is that I have very sensitive and fair skin and on a couple of occasions when I have gotten really sweaty (Texas summer, 100*+), my skin has gotten a little irritated. I honestly think that it's because I don't do as well with high SPF sunscreens, so I should have gotten the SPF 35 rather than the 46. My mistake, but it's not an issue every day by any means. I will get the lower SPF next time, but I would definitely buy this brand again.",5,One,B002MSN3QQ
"This is the wonderful sunscreen and best of all, it doesn't bother my sensitive skin. It disappears into my skin and isn't at all greasy or uncomfortable. This is the only brand I will use. Same with their sunscreen for the body. Elta is it.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I’ve yet to find a better face sunscreen. I started using this a decade ago and periodically try new sunscreens and then throw them out when they leave my face filmy, pores clogged, or eyes watering from it bleeding in the sun. This is the best for sensitive skin.",5,One,B002MSN3QQ
"I have very acne prone, sensitive and dry skin which is ultimately one of the worst combinations for skin ever. However, this sunscreen really helped out with protecting my skin over time. It didn't irritate my skin at all, and there is very minimal white-cast when applied. All the ingredients are great especially for protecting acne prone skin. One of the things I don't like however is that it's not water resistant, and if you don't reapply at least every two hours when you're out in the sun, you will most likely get little but still some sunburns. So four stars",4,0,B002MSN3QQ
"Rosacea is not an easy condition and getting a product to work and not irritate my skin was a must. First time that I use this sunscreen, I purchase it from my dermatologist. I decided to give Amazon a try and was not disappointed. I'm giving it four starts, because the one at purchase at my Dr.'s office was white and this one is a little on the yellowish side. It has not cause any issues so far, but I just began using it last week.",4,3,B002MSN3QQ
Excellent product. I purchased this first from a dermatologist office after having skin cancer on my face. Have not had any negative side effects and love that it has a higher percentage of SPF . Highly recommend .,5,One,B002MSN3QQ
"Honestly I wanted to like this stuff so much I tried all the way to 3 bottles and changed my moisturizers too thinking maybe it’s the moisturizers. No, this stuff makes weird white flakes when applying second time. (See the photo) I can’t just apply sunscreens once a day. Not going to use this anymore.",1,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I really like this sunscreen, it doesn't break me out and has a nice lightweight formula that spreads nicely.

However, there is a false bottom on the container. I was curious how far up the true bottom was so I stuck this piece of lead up a small hole on the false bottom.

I extended the piece of lead as far as I could and it STILL doesn't reach the true bottom.

So just keep in mind that this is 1.7 oz and the container is unnecessarily large. Otherwise great product.",3,One,B002MSN3QQ
"I love the entire Elta sun line, but this product is lightweight and effective at keeping my sensitive skin from breaking out or getting burned. I use the heavier, physical barrier sunscreen in the summer when more protection is needed.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I’d heard about this sunscreen for quite a while and finally decided to start using a separate sunscreen rather than a moisturizer/sunscreen combo. After using it for a couple weeks I can say I love it! The feel is smooth and velvety and doesn’t leave any traces of white on my face. It blends in beautifully, feels light and leaves a nice finish on my face. I’ll be ordering again.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I was given a sample and was hooked from the beginning. This is great for sensitive skin, does not dry out, doesn't flake, and I put it over moisturizer. Apply to neck, ears, and face, and even the top of scalp to protect against the sun's damage.
A top dermatologist recommended this and it is never to late to start.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
very very light and moisturizing. I run 5 days a week and I am usually coveted in zinc that stays white ( even tho package says clear) and it is like glue to get off after my run. this product not like that. I also am allergic to many many sunscreen products. I did not experience any breakouts or rash. I have very sensitive skin so if you fit that criteria you may wish to try this. holding back 2 stars because this is way too expensive. especially if you need to use every single day like I do for my run.,3,One,B002MSN3QQ
"I was sooo happy to find this sunscreen on Amazon - for much cheaper that I pay at my dermatologist! It is made for acne-prone skin and has a broad spectrum SPF with a zinc oxide base. I have had laser surgery on my face for melasma (skin discoloration/hyperpigmentation), and this is the sunscreen my dermatologist recommended to protect my face (because of the zinc oxide). I use it daily - a thin layer after I put on my moisturizer, and I love it. It is lightweight and absorbs pretty quickly. It does make my face a little shiny afterwards (like my experience with most sunscreens), however I put on a little face powder after it has absorbed and that takes care of the shine. Best of all, it does not cause my crazy skin to break-out. It is not waterproof, however. The pump dispenser is very nice, and even though I use this everyday, it seems to last a long time. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.",5,2,B002MSN3QQ
"Best sunscreen I have ever used for my face! Even with plenty of melanin you need a sunscreen and my skin is prone to burning now because of my allergy medicine. That burning can also can lead to hyper-pigmentation from the damage. I LOVE this product! I have yet to find a sunscreen that not only protects my skin but does so without irritating it and causing an outbreak or worse makes me look like I am a character in a ritualistic ceremony of some sort. (Those with a significant natural born tan understand what I am talking about.)

I put this on after my moisturizer, let it absorb and then follow up with my regular makeup routine for every day. It actually has helped my skin improve and have a better glow. I use it without makeup for going to the beach, etc. I learned of this from a consultant at a dermatologist's office and I have stuck with it ever since. I even have a few friends now using it.",5,One,B002MSN3QQ
"I'm in the middle of a course of IPL and microdermabrasion treatments, which makes my skin sensitive and exposed, so my doctor told me that I must wear a high sunscreen on my face if I am ever going to be outside. Besides that, we should all be wearing some sort of sunblock on our face no matter what. Two of the things I hate about sunscreen though is that it can clog my pores and smells terrible. Since I was also running out of moisturizer, I decided I would look into investing into a good two-in-one, and I was fortunate to find one here on Amazon.com on my first try. Eltamd SPF 46 creamy formula feels great on my face, soothing my dry skin, and doesn't have an unpleasant scent. One pump is enough to cover my entire face. It absorbs quickly into my skin, which is great first thing in the morning when I need to put on makeup and get to work.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"Fantastic sunscreen for oily to acne prone skin. Believe me, I am a beauty product Nazi and will pay top dollar for good skin. Love it's non greasy consistency and doesn't leaves a white cast. I use under mineral PRIIA mineral cosmetics (non acne inducing mineral makeup/foundation) and feel like I can confront the world. Lasts a long time and a little goes a long way.",5,2,B002MSN3QQ
I have been using this product for over a year. I would never go back to anything else. I am very picky about facial sunscreens. I don't want to feel like I have anything on and it goes perfectly under any makeup. I also use it as my morning moisturizer and it lasts all day. I have recommended it to others who have also made the switch.,5,One,B002MSN3QQ
"I love how easy it is to put on. No white cast at all, i have a brown skintone for reference. I put the moisturizer and then sunscreen so it doesn’t dry me out. I have gone to beaches with this sunscreen and it has really stuck through all the humidity.",5,One,B002MSN3QQ
I have rosacea so i react to many make up products. This foundation does not irritate my rosacea. It's very lightweight. I can apply it through out the day as needed. It's in a small container and doesn't take up much room. I think I have the smallest make up bag when I travel. It's just great.,5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I have an assortment of sunscreens that I use when I'm outside running or being active. Most of my makeup has sunscreen in it so I really didn't have a dedicated facial sunscreen to use all the time, which is bad I know. I saw this listed as one of my limited time deals and after reading the reviews, I decided to get it.

One complaint I have about most sunscreens is that they are too heavy and/or greasy. They are awkward under makeup and they make me break out or look oily. This sunscreen is matte! It also feels so light and works perfectly as a primer under foundation. On its own, it makes my skin look matte and less porous.

I will still use my waterproof running/triathlon sunscreens when I'm out being sweaty but for the rest of the time, this is absolutely perfect. I am SO glad I saw it as a featured discount item!",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
Had a chemical smell and product seemed old . I suggest buying this from a doctors office,1,One,B002MSN3QQ
"I initially bought this because it got good reviews on one of those websites that talks about secret bad ingredients in sunscreen. I figured it was better to be safe than sorry. And while it's definitely more expensive than cheaper stuff, I love it. It goes on extremely easily, rubs in almost immediately, and doesn't leave my face white at all. I've tried a few of the ""better quality"" sunscreens (like Livestrong), and this one definitely rubs in the best. It's the only one I've gone back to.

I also like that it comes out in a push top, which sets the perfect amount for me. I bring it with me on hot days, and when I've used tubes in the past, hot sunscreen comes out by the gallon. If I'm going to pay more for sunscreen I'm glad I don't waste it by accidentally pouring out half the tube in one use.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"This sunscreen is amazing, I use SPF daily and due to having extremely bad hormonal acne, I generally can only use mineral SPF. I had ran out of drunken elephant Umbra, and wanted something less pricy. The EltaMD applies like a dream, very smooth, silky, and lightweight. It doesn't leave a cast like many mineral SPFS and I have no issues with it pilling up under my foundation. It is fragrance free which is nice. This is my new HG of daily SPF. It has not irritated my acne at all! This product is far superior to prestige SPFs that I've used in the past. I will continue to purchase this product!",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"Honestly this was a pass for me. I know a lot of people love this. It made my skin look really shiny/greasy, but at the same time it dried my skin out like crazy. I used it in winter so maybe I'll give it another shot in the summer when it's more humid. I didn't break out though, so it gets a star for that.",2,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I love this product and give the lotion all the stars! BUT my issue is with the packaging. I would say, every other time I use a new bottle - the pump/applicator breaks shortly after opening and it no longer pumps out lotion which leaves me with a useless bottle that I can't get lotion out of. This has happened multiple times and is so frustrating. I usually have to remove the entire pump applicator and resort to accessing the lotion that way which sucks. Again, i love the content but wish the bottle and applicator were more efficient and useful.",3,One,B002MSN3QQ
"Product is fabulous.....shipper/seller not so much. I love this product so much, I added to my subscription but this month's product came already opened and I was worried about using the products as a result.",5,One,B002MSN3QQ
"This moisturizing sunscreen was recommended to me by my dermatologist. I’ve been using it for over 3 years and have yet to find anything better. It blends easily and I’ve even had my son use it because it helps his acne prone face. I am in my late 40s with combination skin. I use it with extra moisturizer in the winter sry months, but in the summer, it’s all I need under my makeup. It also layers nicely over my lighter serums.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I had been struggling to find a good sunscreen that didn't leave a white cast. Other sunscreens I've encountered that go on clear are irritating, greasy and/or contain fragrance (and expensive to boot). This is none of those things! It was actually recommended to me a while back, but I was reluctant to order it because of the reviews of it being phony, and because the zinc oxide in it made me worry it would leave a cast (since I'm brown skinned). Turns out Amazon is a legitimate vendor of Elta Md products and upon trying it, I found that it's a bit white when applied but goes clear when rubbed in, and dries with absolutely no white cast. Couldn't be happier!",5,One,B002MSN3QQ
"I bought this product around 3 months ago, I've been trying many products for my face, specially moisturizers and sunscreens, I live in Florida and I really need a good sunscreen and another factor in this beautiful State is the humidity it's so high most of the time! then I tried this sunscreen, it is very light, non greasy at all! smells so nice (smooth smell) and last forever, a little bit goes a long way, I use it on my entire face and my neck, I am exposed to the sun while I am at work, most of the time! and I am completely confident that I have a great product protecting my face, another important note I have very sensitive eyes and Elta MD is so gentle that never irritates my eyes when I do apply it around that area, I already have sun spots because on the past I didn't know anything about skincare and how harmful UVA/UVB rays could be for the skin, specially on my face! I do highly recommed this wonderful product.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I was looking for a multi-faceted sunscreen that did not leave a white cast on brown skin. This is hands down the best,most lightweight, and moisturizing sunscreen. It does not leave a cast and applies smoothly. This sunscreen melts into your skin and has not broken me out. I am a fan and will repurchase",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
I bought this based off my derm's recommendation. I use retinol and vitamin C and have sensitive skin but need skin protection. For the cost and size I use a 1/3 to 1/2 a pump but it covers my whole face with some to spare!,5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I bought this product because of I read many good reviews about it , but it is not for sensitive and oily skin. After I started to use it I have whiteheads on my face. And they lost my first package or didn’t send it and replaced for other product waste of time !",1,One,B002MSN3QQ
Found my new go-to face sunscreen after recommended by a popular women’s magazine. Light and smooth consistency. Rubs in well and no white chalky residue. Unscented and hasn’t clogged my pores or cause any breakouts. Highly recommend and I’m definitely buying it again (and again).,5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I was having a lot of issues with skin sensitivity and breakouts, but I have a job where I have to spend a lot of time in the sun. I switched facial cleansers (CeraVe), moisturizer (Eucerin), and started using this sunscreen all around the same time. This sunscreen goes on really smoothly, doesn't appear white like a lot of mineral sunscreens, and a little goes a long way. It has provided really good sun protection despite heat and sweat. And my skin has stopped breaking out! It's worth the price if you have sensitive skin!",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
EltaMD is the best everyday sunscreen and moisturizer. I’ve been using it every morning for over a year and my face is always so soft and glowing. It’s light weight and not greasy once absorbed into the skin. It leaves me feeling great after I put it on.,5,0,B002MSN3QQ
I like this because it is moisturizing but not greasy. It does not leave a white cast on my skin either (I'm African American),5,One,B002MSN3QQ
"Work at dermatologist's office, this is one of the most frequently recommended sunscreens to teens and adults. Lightweight lotion, helps keep breakouts at bay and keeps skin healthy. You'll see a slight blueish-white haze when you first put this on, that's a good thing, you want to see that zinc oxide & titanium dioxide sitting over your skin because that's what's protecting your skin from sun damage.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I hated using sunscreen, but i still wore it everyday because im so pale. I have oily skin, and tend to break out in my chin, and mouth area. This sunscreen almost feels like a mousse, its so soft and it doesn't break me out or make me oily. I Love that it has niacinamide which was recommended to me to help with acne scars. It doesn't pill with any of my other face products, except with the Benefit Porefessional Primer, and i thought that maybe it was the silica, but this doesn't happen with my Smashbox Photo Finish Foundations Primer Light, nor does it happen with creamier primers.",5,2,B002MSN3QQ
"This is so rare for a sunscreen, but it won't cause breakouts. It also doesn't contain the chemicals known to be more harsh when used daily.

I highly recommend it!

However, you might still want to use a moisturizer if you have dry skin.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
I have rosacea. I have searched for years for a sunblock that will save my face. This is the first product that did not irate my skin. I did notice a slight redness this morning that appears to be a minor burn but there was no irritation. This maybe because I react even when walking to the mailbox I am so sensitive.,4,0,B002MSN3QQ
"My dermatologist recommended this product. OK, I guess I'll try it. I first purchased the product directly from my dermatologist' office. I was surprised! It's not greasy, blends easily into your skin, and leaves your skin soft. I have ordered several bottles since then (through Amazon), and will continue to order more, as soon as my current bottle is finished. I love this product, and highly recommend it to other family members and friends.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I wanted to love this. I wanted to love this so bad. However, I think the niacinamide being 5% is too strong for my skin and for a lot of others too. Everything else besides the packaging and that I absolutely love though :(",3,0,B002MSN3QQ
I like this sunscreen because its not greasy and does not block pores.,5,One,B002MSN3QQ
"I bought this on my esthetician's recommendation. This login leaves white flaky residual after 2 mins of application. Can't use it outdoors, what's the point if can't use it outdoors...very disappointed. I gave this product 4 weeks, but still same experience. I wish I could return this defective product.",2,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I don’t normally write reviews on products, but this one is well worth it. I’ve tried many different fave sunscreens and this is the first that I feel I look forward to using every day. It’s smooth, has a nice, light pleasant scent, doesn’t leave a white cast, and is protecting. I love it!",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"Hands down, the best spf. I used it on my face for a lake trip this weekend, and my face stayed my natural color, while my back and arms burned because I used another spf. My skin is acne prone and oily, but this product isn’t oily and gives my skin a good, flawless look after applying it.

UPDATE: I think it’s a bit too dry for my combo skin, so I started adding a moisturizer under this.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"This is the FIRST sunscreen face lotion that works perfectly for my sensitive, fair skin. I like everything about it and have found my answer for spending time outside walking and gardening without any repercussions from the sun! Love it!",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"My friend who has very sensitive skin and nuts to cosmetics recommended me this as she had been used this sun screen for a long time.
Now I use this almost everyday as even primary before make ups.

The texture is very smooth and light, so you don’t need to use so much amount at one time. Smell almost nothing but a bit sunscreen-ish (haha) as any of this kind of products.

Overall I love this and will purchase again when I run out of current one.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"Best SPF ever!! I have been using this product for a couple of years now and don's see myself using anything different. Other products would either make my face oily or make me break out but this one is on of a kind. The 1.7 oz bottle lasts me close to two months and I religiously use it daily, sometimes twice a day even when I reapply before hiking/running. Yes, it is on the high end just for SPF you may think - but anything for your face is an investment in my personal opinion and this one is well worth it!",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I normally don’t write reviews, but, this spf is the best spf hands down. It feels very smooth, and moisturizing, its oil-free (yet it gives healthy shine), it blends like a dream leaving no weird or sticky residue, and NO WHITE CAST!!!! (I am very fair skinned).
Look no further, it’s expensive but worth every penny.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"This is the perfect daily sunscreen. No smell, great under makeup, lightweight, high spf!!! I love it so much that I sent a bottle to my mother in law. This makes daily sun protection easy. Only thing is that I wish it was cheaper. The formula is very similar to the ANTHELIOS SX SPF MOISTURIZER WITH MEXORYL SPF 15.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"This has to be the best sunscreen for the face I've ever used. I have combination, sensitive, acne prone skin that is very easily agitated. I am also a fair skinned red head that is easily sunburned. A lot of products can break me out. I tried the facial sunscreen by Neutrogena for acne prone skin, and it made me an absolute oil slick. It also did break me out. I got this after doing some research and seeing the high reviews, and I can definitely see that they were not exaggerating. It does not break me out or cause any excess oil. I wear it all day while my son is playing ball and no burn or oil! It is a bit expensive, but for me it's worth it. Will definitely buy again.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I have one of those faces that is generally clear but during um, hormonal times of the month I turn into a pink pizza face. My dermatologist recommended this to me during breakouts, but I use it every day. I have one in every bag that I own.

Goes on very smoothly and absorbs quickly-- it actually feels good to put it on! Under makeup or by itself, it's been a lifesaver for me. It has really made my skin look better because it helps calm redness.

Also, if you are one of those people who breakout whenever you use sunblock, use this one!! Regular sunblock clogs me up (even the kind that say they don't), and I have never had a problem with this one. Bonus: it actually does protect you from sunburn!",5,One,B002MSN3QQ
"I wear sunscreen every day and this product is perfect. Light and pleasant, moisturizing.
Drugstore sunscreens (even high end ones) often cause a reaction to my sensitive facial skin — this one did not! And, best of all, this is MUCH less costly than the expensive sunscreen I was buying at the skin doctor’s office. Highly recommended.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I have very sensitive skin and recently developed rosacea. I haven't been able to use sunscreen on my face without it completely breaking out within a few hours of applying the sunscreen. Ulta MD has passed the few hour threshold. Though my face did get a ltitle irritated by the end of the day, the irritation was much less severe than with other sunscreens and, it does not last long. Definitely the best facial sunscreen I've used on my face in a long time.",4,0,B002MSN3QQ
"Great suncreen been using it for years but look at the ingredients in the rest of your skin care routine. This suncreen has niacinamide which is a popular active ingredient now so its in a lot of products.

The problem is that too much of it is irritating to the skin. So watch out on using more than one product with niacinamide. Same goes other ingredients like hyaluronic acid. Irritation and toxicity is in the dose.

I switch between suncreens on days I use other products with niacinamide.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"For some reason my most recent purchase of this exact item has a different smell than my prior ones. Not sure if the formula changed or what so I am a bit weary. Hopefully it works the same, time will tell.",4,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I have purchased and thrown out more facial sunscreens than I want to admit. My dermatologist gave me a sample of this sunscreen and I love it. It is not greasy, goes on light and it does NOT make my face sweat like so many of them do. This is the perfect sunscreen for your face.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"My dermatologist sold this - I bought it first at her office but now I just order it online. I can spend all day in the sun and feel protected - although I do reapply on my nose. It does not show white like other effective sunscreens (lower zinc level maybe)? It doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. So so much better than the drugstore versions and hey, it's your face - its worth it.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"Very moisturizing. I find it better in the winter for my 50+ skin. I also like it for my neck area which needs more moisture than my face. A bit expensive, but a little goes a long way & it's better than skin cancer or having skin damage &v wrinkles from the sun.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I read about this on a dermatologist’s (@lauralacquer) blog and I’m so happy I bought it! It’s a mineral sunscreen, which is better for you than chemical sunscreen. It goes on thin, smooth and feels quality, like a skincare product you’d get from Sephora...it doesn’t feel sunscreen-y at all! And of course, it did the job! No burns from my 4 day beach vacation!",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I use retinol every day and was looking for a sunscreen that would be gentle on my face while giving me protection. A friend of mine introduce me to this brand. It smells good, is gentle and provides the daily protection I need. This will be part of my routine for a long time.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"This is by far the best of the best! It’s not only recommended by dermatologist but also facial experts! It’s light wear, goes on really easy and doesn’t have a sunscreen smell. More of a medicinal one but that’s because of the zinc. I absolutely love this stuff!!",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"As someone prone to acne, breakouts, and has had numerous procedures to try to fix his acne-scarred face, I have used Elta MD every single day. Even days that I don't go out. Not only have I never had a single breakout from this product, compared to others from brands like Neutrogena, but this product calms my skin and makes my scarring and redness less noticeable. This is an essential!",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"Works as a hypoallergenic sunscreen for sensitive skin, but the low rating is due to the chemical smell that persists until it is washed off. This is fragrance-free, but is is not scent-free (likely due to the innate scents of the ingredients used in the sunscreen). If you are sensitive to such smells, avoid.",2,0,B002MSN3QQ
I use this brand recommended by my Dermatologist. It is a must have since skin cancer surgery. It protects well and is gentle on my sensitive skin. It does not burn my skin as some sunscreens can. Very soothing.,5,0,B002MSN3QQ
Definitely one of my favorite sunscreens! Great for oily or acne prone skin. It does leave a bit of a white cast (because it's a combination sunscreen) but I find that it fades after a few minutes. Definitely worth the price!,5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I have been using this lotion for a couple of years now. It is the perfect first layer to your makeup routine. It is light, not greasy, moisturizes, and has high SPF. The pump container works very well allowing you to get out every drop. And a good value!",5,One,B002MSN3QQ
Leaves a film that peels if you rub your face at all. And makes you sweat more,1,3,B002MSN3QQ
I'm allergic to most sunscreen. This is the only one I have found that works and I can wear it over my face lotion. I have rosacea and I must keep the sun off my face. It's not greasy and it doesn't feel like sunscreen and leave no weird flimsy on your face. I would recommend for everyone.,5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"It is hard to find a good sunscreen. This one is great. I really like it. I have oily, acne prone and sensitive skin. I use a lot of active ingredients which make my skin dry, so this one doesn't hydrate me so much so next time I'll try the other one which more hydrating. It feels nice on the skin and doesn't leave a white cast. The only problem is that a little pricy, but it is a very good product.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I was always told when growing up to wear sunscreen every. single. day. But did I listen? No. Putting sunscreen on my face always resulted in a greasy white film that caused break outs and poor makeup results. Now that I’m in my late 30s I have sunspots, so I figured better late than never. Where was this sunscreen when I was younger?! It’s amazing. No white cast, no oily residue...I wear it every single day. It truly is an amazing product that I can’t tell enough people about.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I really love this product but after reading the reviews I am scared it’s not the real deal.
It smells different than my other bottle. When I received this product the box top was open and the bottle didn’t have any plastic on lid.

Is this a fake?",3,One,B002MSN3QQ
"Trying to pick up the habit of applying sunscreen daily is a chore.. especially for someone like me, who genuinely doesn't care and is happy to slap on some jojoba each morning and call it a day. I picked this up based on raving recommendations from two trusted sources, and now that it's summer wanted something for the beach.

Man. Goes on SUPER smooth and clear. No residue, no film. Has the refreshing scent of a clean summer poolside. I unexpectedly love it.

Sunscreen is no longer just ""a beach thing"" -- I am now officially a daily facial sunscreen kinda gal. At least until this bottle runs out. Which it might, soon.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"This is the best face sunscreen I have tried. It was recommended by my dermatologist. It is a little expensive, but worth it!! Not greasy and doesn’t stink. Rubs in completely, no white left over residue.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
This is my third bottle of this sunscreen protection. It was recommended by my dermatologist. I love it; works great on protection from the sun and also helps my sensitive skin stay moisturized.,5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"This product was recommended to me by my aesthetician, whom I trust completely. I tried it and I immediately broke out. Ugh. Not that it’s uncommon for my skin to break out after trying anything different, but this breakout was BAD. And my whole face turned very red and irritated and my skin ached, on top of the breakout. It was horrible. I used it for 2 days (once per day) and I broke out and was irritated for a week! Definitely would not recommend this stuff for sensitive skin. My 2 bottles both appear “legit.” Have no clue how well the sunscreen part works.",1,0,B002MSN3QQ
I don’t like how this feels on my face and I think it makes my face itch. It just feels like I’m wearing sunscreen - I was expecting something lighter. I love that it’s clear and is easy to spread.,3,0,B002MSN3QQ
This is not clear it makes my brown skin purple. Its not the worst but its not clear at all. I reallllly wanted this to be staple bc ive heard great things about it.,1,2,B002MSN3QQ
"I LOVE this product.

Even in my early 30s, my skin is prone to breakouts. Most moisturizers leave me feeling greasy. Not so with Elta. It leaves my skin feeling dry and smooth and, best of all, protected. At trisk of sounding overdramatic, it's actually a joy to put on.

I've been using this product for over a year upon the recommendation of my dermatologist and I've told so many friends about it.

The sunscreen really works too. Just yesterday I spent all day at a fair. I put this on as a part of my morning routine, but forgot to put sunscreen anywhere else. My shoulders are rather burnt, but my face and neck show no signs of sun.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"This product pills on me no matter what I do. Even when it’s not layered with anything else, it just flakes and looks terrible. I’ve heard great things from others and I really wanted to love this brand but this is the second one I’ve had issues with.",3,One,B002MSN3QQ
"My skin breaks out if you look at it wrong. I can't wear any foundation except mineral foundation with only the basic ingredients. And I cannot walk out of the house without a good sunscreen on my face. Most are too heavy for my oily, acne-prone skin, and I've become more determined to avoid chemicals that my skin can absorb. By accident, I stumbled across the website for Environmental Working Group (ewg.org) and saw their list of top environmentally safe sunscreens. I promptly ordered EltaMD UV Clear SPF 46, and I found my Holy Grail of sunscreens. Clear is lightweight, non-greasy, and doesn't make my face an oil slick by the end of the day. It doesn't clog my pores, and my skin actually looks a little brighter. Yes, it costs more than the drugstore brands, but not outrageously so. And it's worth it.",5,One,B002MSN3QQ
This product is labeled to be for acne-prone skin (sensitive skin in general) and it caused me to break out super bad. It was not even a break out it was more of an allergic reaction similar to the other person that mentions this in the reviews. I returned it and I should have read the reviews before buying. I had used this product before and I'm not sure if they changed the formula or what's going on but I will never risk my skin with this product again.,1,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I have SUPER sensitive skin. My skin is especially resistant to sunscreen. I've tried a ton of acne-prone safe sunscreens and this is the only one that works for me. If you're prone to malassezia folliculitis/fungal acne, this is the sunscreen for you. It doesn't leave a white film and it's very light. It also has niacinamide, which is a skincare superstar that everybody needs in their routine. Especially in the winter! Get this sunscreen for the love of god.",5,One,B002MSN3QQ
"The consistency is really nice and it doesn’t leave a white cast. However, it caused a breakout on my super sensitive skin. It’s a shame, but I’ve since moved on to Cotz, which does not cause any reactions.",1,0,B002MSN3QQ
"UPDATE: Not sure what I was even referring to about when it comes to the smell anymore because either I got used to it or I was being odd because I don't smell anything anymore.

I have oily acne-prone skin and I've always found most sunscreens too heavy especially since I put on makeup afterwards, but I couldn't NOT use SPF. After trying almost everything in local drugstores, I came across this one. After using it for a while, I am proud to say that I haven't had any new breakouts, my hyper-pigmentation from acne picking is almost faded away, and I just feel so more secure around the sun. Feels super lightweight and I wear it under my makeup and foundation. The only CON I have is that it has this smell, this smell I can't describe. It isn't strong, it isn't terrible, it isn't perfumy, but it's something I don't love either. Definitely nothing major though!",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I love this! I have adult acne and almost all SPF I have tried on is either too oily or it worsens my acne. When I found the raving review of this product, I was in doubt. But this SPF does not disappoint. Now my skin looks so much better than before. And my acne condition is surely improving. Highly recommend this product to anyone suffering adult acne like myself.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"The texture is perfect (easy to apply)
It doesn't have a chemical/perfume smell like other products I've used (Anthelios, Skinceuticals)
It doesn't cause breakouts
It doesn't leave a whitish cast
It doesn't leave a greasy film.

It is a bit pricey.

However it has replaced all the other daily sunscreens I have used over the years.

An excellent product.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"The Elta MD sunscreen lines are one of the few that doesn't irritate my skin. Unfortunately, it does make it break out on and off. Not anything terrible, but enough to warrant it as just a back-up if I don't have the Vanicream Sunscreen at hand (which I've grown to love more and is equal to this brand, in my opinion).",4,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I really like this moisturizer with sunscreen. I've used it for a couple years now. I tend to have oily skin and this stuff is great at not making me oilier!! However, the last time I purchased the product they had changed the style of the pump, which is TERRIBLE. The lotion barely comes out and I can't tell if the bottle is running out way sooner than it should be or if it's just the pump mechanism.

PLEASE GO BACK TO THE OLD PUMP STYLE!!!",4,2,B002MSN3QQ
Very sheer tint but makes skin look fresh and amazing.,5,One,B002MSN3QQ
"This is the most cosmetically beautiful sunscreen I've ever used. It leaves no cast, spreads thinly and easily, and doesn't leave your face looking greasy. The fact that it targets acne is an added bonus! You only need a small amount, so the bottle, while small for the price, lasts a long time.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"Love this product!! So glad I discovered it! I was never able to wear sunscreen on my face before without it causing blemishes. If your skin is prone to breakouts, you need to get this on your face. It's a game changer. Feels great, oil-free, and great sun protection!",5,One,B002MSN3QQ
Product works as expected. It's very light and doesn't turn you skin white like other sunscreen. I have combination skin and dont have any problems wearing this under my makeup everyday. My major complaint is that the pump design sucks. 99% of the time it does not work and/or delivers a tiny amount. I read on another review that this problem could be solved if you store the bottle updside down. Tried that and it's true...pump will work as intended if it's stored upsode down. But the problem with that is some product leaks out of the bottle. Overall i like the product but the pump is annoying to deal with. For this reason i will not re-purchase.,2,0,B002MSN3QQ

"I have tried so many products and continue to come back to this one. It has been the best for my skin.
- It doesn't cause my already bad skin to break out.
- It spreads evenly and doesn't leave a chalky residue.
- Leaves my skin feeling hydrated.
- No sting and smells rather pleasant (for sunscreen).
I always make sure to keep a bottle of this in my back pack, another bottle at home, and another in my husband's car. He also likes Elta MD after I got him to try it. I hope you do as well!",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I know it's pricey but using this once per day, I can get 6 months of use out of this bottle. It doesn't cause me to breakout, it absorbs fast, and I can apply most liquid foundation on top of it and it won't cause issues. My dermatologist recommended this brand because it blocks uva and uvb Rays.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I have sensitive skin, rosacea and hormonal acne. Most sunscreen moisturizers are irritating or leave a white residue - not this one. If you have problem skin, I highly recommend the Elta MD clear. No breakouts!",5,One,B002MSN3QQ
"My dermatologist recommend that I use Elta MD bc its formula and it protects 2 ultraviolet radiation UVA/UVB which is important to have in any sunscreen you purchase. Both UVA and UVB rays can increase your risks for skin cancer; additionally, these rays can cause significant sun damage, which leads to wrinkles, hyper pigmentation, and other advanced signs of aging. This is a great sunscreen, feels light on my skin and comes on sheer and doesn't cause break outs to my sensitive skin. I will be a loyal customer to this sunscreen thats for sure!",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"My dermatologist in Atlanta recommended this sunscreen because I had spent so much time in FL my skin started to have patchy discoloration (of course not a nice tan like everyone else gets from the sun!) even though I was applying a drugstore facial sunscreen so I bought it from her office but I've been ordering this on Amazon ever since.

I love this product because (1) it is very sheer not greasy and goes under makeup flawlessly (2) it is super skin friendly and doesn't burn or irritate my skin (3) it lasts and lasts.

I have tried other facial sunscreen from the drug store and even the ones that claim to be calming irritate my skin. It completely vanishes into the skin and does not turn your skin white. I apply this under my bare minerals makeup daily.

My boyfriend is a sweaty sweaty man and he puts thIs sunscreen all over his face and his shaved head and even when he sweats this product does not sting or burn. This is the only sunscreen my boyfriend will use.

This product lasts too. I will put this on my face in the morning, spend all day at the beach and my face is not burned at the end of the day.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
I really wanted to love this sunscreen but I couldn't. It made me look washed out kind of gray. I tried to put on a serum beforehand but it still wouldn't blend. But it didn't make me greasy like other sunscreens. It actually helped with shine and and didn't make me break out. I tried it for a short time under a bb cream but I don't like the extra step so I gave up. And I have no desire to try and figure out make-up. I'm sure it would work on lighter skin. I gave mine to my super pale boyfriend. The color problem was my only issue.,3,5,B002MSN3QQ
"I burn. It's kinda my thing. I also take a medication that messes with my skin and makes it more likely that a) I'll burn, b) my skin won't heal right, and c) my already sensitive skin is now actively looking for the opportunity to get contact dermatitis. This stays on, permits no sun through, and doesn't give me a rash. It also doen't smell, which is another thing I appreciate.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I have rosacea and this works well, doesn’t leave a white cast which I appreciate very much. I can say that this is pretty water resistant!",5,One,B002MSN3QQ
"This is by far the best oil free high SPF moisturizer for those with sensitive and/or acne-ridden skin, and I have tried dozens over many years. It's light yet deeply moisturizing, without any white tint that you get from some sunscreens. When you first put it on, for a few seconds there is the faintest white-ish tint which disappears within about 10-15 seconds. Moreover, the SPF is very high, which is hard to find in light oil-free moisturizers -- usually you have to pick between light with low spf and heavy with high spf. This gives the best of both worlds. Plus, I don't have to wear any primer over it for daily makeup use, as makeup sits on top of this moisturizers evenly and the moisturizer acts as a bit of a primer. However, for special occasions or long sunny days, I can still put primer on top of this moisturizer without any issue. After it dries, it's as though there is nothing on your skin.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I use diffirin so i need good sun protection so i wont get bad effects of sun since skin is more sensitive. I feel like this protects skin and it goes on very clear, doesn't have much of a greasy feel either compared to other sunscreens. And there is an expiration date on mine. Just make sure to buy it from a verified seller like amazon for a legit product.",5,One,B002MSN3QQ
"This stuff is pricey but worth it. I’ve been struggling with acne in my 20s, way more than as a teenager. Adding this to my routine has made such a difference. I have oily skin and it controls the oil so well and hasn’t caused breakouts. And the sun protection is great.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ

I have melasma on my fore head and it gets worse (a whole lot worse) in sun so I'm careful....all sunscreen are NOT created equal. This helps protect my brown spots from getting worse and other little spots from starting up. Yes you have to reapply...but you have to with all of them. UGH!",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
I am so sad that I just saw 2016 EWG ranking of this sunscreen an 8 where 10 is the worst. It rated moderate for health concerns and poor for UVA/UVB coverage. I love this sunscreen because it goes on clear and light and helps prevent acne breakouts. I've been using it a few years after my Dermatologist recommended it. When I see her again I will be asking her thoughts on this sunscreen. Anyone else have thoughts on this new EWG ranking?,3,2,B002MSN3QQ
"I love this sunscreen! It is light, easy to apply, and goes on perfectly under makeup.

I play a lot of golf in AZ and have used several of the store brands over the years that either cause me skin issues or do not protect. This stuff just works well. Lasts all day long with the exception of swimming for extended periods. Takes very little to cover my face and neck.,5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"If you have sensitive skin that is prone to breakouts of any kind, you NEED this moisturizer that doubles as your daily UV.

I have noticed my face isn't getting red from sunburn. This sunscreen works great on oily skin too,5,0,B002MSN3QQ
Dermatologist recommended. She was right. It doesn’t feel or smell like sunscreen. I use it under makeup and it doesn’t cause that sunscreen shine. It goes on smooth and absorbs into the facial skin quickly so no waiting for it to dry to apply foundation. It has a wonderful moisturizing effect and most days I don’t wear foundation over it. And it is very effective sunblock.,5,0,B002MSN3QQ

I have combined it with First Aid Beauty moisturizing serum and that seems to be a perfect combo.,5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I adore this sunscreen. Perfect! No bad smell, applies easily, you can wear it under makeup. I've bought it many times over! It's especially good if you have sensitive skin and don't like the smell of regular sunscreens, since this is mineral-based. It's also not sticky. Not waterproof though, but that's fine. I wear waterproof when swimming.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"Best sunscreen I've ever used!
I have sensitive skin and somewhat dry skin. Generally, if a sunscreen is moist enough, it burns; and if a sunscreen doesn't burn, it's not moist enough and it leaves white marks all around my face.
This is the perfect solution. I will probably stick to it for my life",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"i didn’t really enjoy using this product on my face, I’ve really just stuck to using it on my neck. I really wanted this to work on my face because it is a physical sunscreen. But, it was just constantly pilling on my face. At first, I thought it was because I wore moisturizer under. So, I stopped that and just put the sunscreen straight on my skin. That didn’t work either. So, I’ve opted to just using it on my neck and it’s worked great for that. If it pills, I mean, I don’t even notice.",3,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I use this for everyday moisturizer and sunscreen. I have mature skin and live in a dry climate.

By “clear” I thought the sunscreen would be for all skin colors. This cream leaves a white residue and flakes with certain moisturizers. it is not for darker skin tones. Also has a weird smell when u put it on ur face.,3,3,B002MSN3QQ

If the oil remains unchecked, I get severe acne, the kind that are bigger than a quarter and don't come up to the surface for weeks. My skin has always been sensitive and this doesn't seem to prevent me from turning into a cherry. Also, since the sunscreen is somewhat moisturizing, in combination with my oily skin, my makeup won't stay in place. Booo! Unfortunately my last sunscreen was BurnOut with 18% zinc oxide, but they changed the formula and now it is too oily. I'll try adding zinc oxide to my makeup and hope that works!",2,One,B002MSN3QQ

"I purchased this and have been loving it, I’m not sure if the season change or just the product but now when I put this on my skin it burns, itches and I get red splotches all over my face. I tend to lean towards dry skin ans I haven’t changed anything in my routine. I’ve been using this for about 3 months with no issues. I used one full pump for my whole face and never noticed a white cast but I am fair skinned.",4,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I loved the feel of this product on my skin. It spread easily and didn’t leave a white cast. But it did leave my face looking greasy.

My favorite facial sunscreen! Unrivaled texture for me. My favorite part about it is that i can apply it directly over my eyelids and inner corners and crows feet area to keep that area looking young and it doesnt burn. Before i had to purchase shiseidos eye sunscreen separately and use that on my eyes and something different on the rest of my face.,5,3,B002MSN3QQ

My new favorite sunscreen! Not greasy and doesn’t leave a white cast. I have very acne prone skin and this doesn’t break me out. I will buy again.,5,One,B002MSN3QQ
"I am in LOVE with this product. A friend recommended this Moisturizer with SPF as the ONLY one on the market that has not made her break-out. I completely agree! I have super sensitive skin and this gives me a non-sticky surface (let it sink in) and for some reason, I don't need foundation after I apply this even though there is no pigment in it.
what an awesome product!",4,One,B002MSN3QQ
"I LOVE this sunscreen. I have melasma (hyper-pigmentation) on my face that gets darker in the sun. I bought this before meeting with a dermatologist, and when I told her which sunscreen I was using, she told me it's her favorite and the one she recommends to her patients.

It's light and rubs in easily and doesn't have an offensive smell. Make up goes on smoothly over this sunscreen. I have pretty sensitive skin when it comes to sunscreen on my face, but this one caused no breakouts and kept me sunburn free all summer. It's a little pricey, but as I used it only on my face, it lasted for awhile. I definitely recommend this sunscreen, especially if you have melasma or other hyper-pigmentation issues on your face!",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"a bit disappointed with this, i was expecting it to be a clear sincere as it says but its more like a white lotion that ended up leaving a white cast on my face. while it works great as a sunscreen i don't think they should be calling this ""clear"" if it leaves a white cast and comes out like a white lotion.",3,0,B002MSN3QQ

I love this facial sunscreen. It glides on like silk and drys quickly. There is no greasey shine or whiteness. Drys clear as the name says. It also protects me from the sun (as it should) ive been out all day and I’ve never gotten a sunburn using this product. Yippeee!,5,0,B002MSN3QQ
This sunblock is on the pricey side but I'm really happy with it. It does the job and there is absolutely no white cast which was a big deal for me as a black person. It also doesn't cause any problems with my skin which is very sensitive,5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I don't like using the same product always even though it works, I just like trying different, new products. But, this sun screen, I can't resist continuously using this. Since I have a very fair skin with tendency of easily getting light brown sun spots, I can not live even a day without a sun screen especially in SoCal.

It is so important for me my sun screen is not heavy, not scented, and not oily. I prefer my sun screen to be light but with a high spf in broad spectrum protection so I can wear it under makeup, or constantly reapplying through out a day when hiking, or simply wear it as a day time moisturizer comfortably.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I ordered this sunscreen after my dermatologist recommended it. I was hoping that it would be ""different"" from other sunscreens, somehow, because it's labeled ""UV Clear"" and that it's good for sensitive skin. Well, it honestly doesn't seem much different from any other sunscreen - I still feel like it gives me a bit of a pallor, and it feels no different from any other (I hate the feeling of sunscreen on my face). I'm giving it 4 stars because I do think it's a good sunscreen, and it IS on the EWG Safe Sunscreen list.",4,One,B002MSN3QQ
"This is my favorite daily face sunscreen to wear under makeup. It is creamy and moisturizing but still lightweight. It blends easily onto the skin and it absorbs quickly. You can apply foundation directly over the top of it without waiting for it to dry and set. It does not cause my foundation to slip down. It doesn't make my face shiny. It doesn't irritate my skin. It doesn't feel heavy, it just feels like light moisturizing lotion. I use it every day under foundation. I had to return the first bottle I got because the pump was broken but the return was fast and easy.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ

"I’m absolutely obsessed with this SPF. It works so well for my skin that I’ve now entered it into my skin care daily line up, and it’s an integral part of my line up. I have really bad rosacea, and when I went to a new dermatologist she told me that I needed to use something less oily than the banana boat I was slathering on if I wanted my ease the effects of my rosacea. I started using it in conjunction with this new sulfur based facial mask  TreeActiv Anti Acne & Rosacea Treatment Sulfur Mask Plus Rhassoul, Bentonite Clay Mask with Witch Hazel & Aloe Vera - Refreshing Lemon Scent (1 Jar) (8 Oz)  that has really been rocking out on my skin and clearing it up. Basically I use the mask as an exfoliator, which clears up my acne, reduces redness, and brightens my skin, then I use this  TreeActiv+ Tea Tree Oil Acne Solution for Advanced Acne Treatment - All Natural Acne Spot Treatment - Blemishes Gone or Your Money Back! (60ml)  stuff as an astringent, and then I put the Eltamd right before I put my make up on for the day. This new system I’ve been using has been working like a charm. The Eltamd is so good at protecting my skin from the sun that it doesn’t get dried out at all, and it doesn’t burn like it used to. Also generally speaking, my skin is so much better than it was a month ago and I’m hoping the improvements will just keep going. I definitely recommend this SPF to anyone who’s looking for a lightweight protectant against the sun that won’t clog their pores or cause them to break out.",5,320,B002MSN3QQ
"Awesome sunscreen. Best I have ever used, from drugstore to very pricey dermatologist types. Helps to clear up acne and redness, and is not greasy. It has an odor to it wish I wish it did not, but that won’t prevent me from buying in the future. Definitely worth trying!",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"This went on creamy and clear, then became sticky and eventually dried, sucking out the moisture from my face. I bought this to use under my make up. The foundation will not glide because of the dried sunscreen. I expect it's the zinc. My husband says it works fine for him. T",3,0,B002MSN3QQ
"This sunscreen was pleasant to apply - it didn't leave a white film on my face. It did protect my face from sunburn. However, it showed me the importance of being aware of what your skin is sensitive to when purchasing ""sensitive skin"" products. Since my skin reacts badly to niacinamide (which I didn't realize until using this sunscreen), this sunscreen gave me facial hives. I've never had my skin react to a product so intensely and painfully.",4,0,B002MSN3QQ
"Seriously. I live in Hawaii and must wear sunscreen daily. I also have skin that is subject to oiliness and breakouts. Wonderful. What's a woman to do? Wear the Eltamd UV Clear! This is the ONLY facial sunscreen that does not cause me to break out, become more oily, or feel sticky/greasy. I love it, use it daily, and buy it regularly. The sunscreen goes on silky smooth, very easy to rub in. My skin absorbs it easily and it actually helps even out my skin tone. I knew I had found a winner when I went to visit my dermatologist for my annual skin checkup and I saw that her office had started to carry the Eltamd sunscreen line! I also use this on my neck and the tops of my hands. What I also love about this sunscreen is the bottle it comes in: lightweight with a nice pump feature. But, the MOST important point is that this sunscreen works. Our summertime UV ratings are very high here and I never burn with this sunscreen on. That's saying a lot. Give it a try, especially if you're breakout prone. I don't think you'll regret it.",5,One,B002MSN3QQ
I have mix skin type and this one doesn’t clock my pores! I love it! It’s give me a great protection. It’s white when you first apply but after 5-10 min it’s completely absorb from the skin,5,0,B002MSN3QQ

"I've tried a few high SPF products, most recently was Shishedo, and I generally find they are like a thicker lotion consistency and once applied I look like Casper The Ghost, and have to work rigorously to spread evenly. But not with this stuff - - Etla MD goes on really easy, smooth, and it blends into your skin very quickly, and a little dab goes a long way. I love the compact size and pump-action which makes it easy to apply as opposed to having to squeeze a bottle (like toothpaste). Excellent product and I will buy again.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ

"At age 24 with very fair skin, living in Texas, and doing a fair amount of commuting, I've already started to notice some lines in the morning on the left side of my face from sun exposure while driving. (!!!) With the sun being so intense here, I've been reluctant to go out and garden or walk during the day without putting some icky yucky sunscreen on. A client of mine suggested this product, so I got it and I put it on every morning. I don't notice it all day, and I can now go outside without fear. :) It rubs in easily and actually moisturizes my dry skin. On the days that I choose to put a little makeup on, I can put it on almost immediately since it goes on so nicely.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I love this stuff! It is more expensive than its competitors, but it's so light that I can use it EVERY DAY. It's part of my daily routine - even under my make-up. This product is free of the avo-benzone (and the other common ""avo-"" ingredient in sunblocks) - which I have discovered cause me to break-out and turn red. This product is mild - and has never caused my face to inflame or sting, and it works. Can't recall getting sunburned since starting to use it. It's worth every penny.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ

"First recommended by my son's dermatologist, we were hesitant at first because he has *very* sensitive skin, so nearly any cream or sunscreen based product has caused him to break out in the past. This one, on the other hand, is the exception and he absolutely loves it. For those with teenagers who have acne, use this sunscreen. Not only does it help keep the redness down from any scarring or active bumps when in the sun, it also lightens up the face a little bit, causing it to look very clear.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ

My face has no sunburn unlike other type of sunscreen. There's a bit of white color on my face but it's alright it didn't bother me. I love the way how my face glows when I start using this sunscreen. 👍👍👍,5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I will use this everyday for the rest of my life!

I was first recommended this by my dermatologist. I am allergic to oxybenzone found in most sunscreens (think: red hives all over my face and body.) On top of that, my sensitive skin will break out, even with the ""oil-free"" / ""won't clog pores!"" sunscreens.

I use this under makeup and have no greasy feeling, which is rare for zinc oxide-based sunscreens.

My tip: Pump onto fingertips and add a few drops of water before applying it to face. Make for a much smoother application.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
I bought this after suffering from a massive breakout due to a foundation reaction. I needed a light moisturizer/sunscreen that absorbed quickly and didn't clog my pores. I was intrigued by the other reviews for this this that claimed this lotion tones down redness. Indeed it does! After a few weeks of use my breakouts have subsided (I don't credit that to this lotion though) and my normally red face looks more balanced after I put this on. I love that it's an spf 46. My skin doesn't look oily or shiny after I put this on. And it moisturizes just enough to help smooth my skin before applying powder. I will continue to purchase this as long as the price is reasonable.,4,0,B002MSN3QQ

I do suggest that if you're a sweater, you reapply the product every 2 hours or so to be safe from any sun damage.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ

It's not ideal for sweating or sports, so I would use a different sunscreen for those purposes (the MDSolarSciences gel sunscreen is my absolute favorite for sweaty activities because it STAYS PUT). The UV Clear goes on a little shiny at first but I find it mattifies in a few hours. I usually wear homemade vitamin C serum and CeraVe lotion underneath, or bare if I'm in a hurry. My skin reacts very positively to niacinamide, which attracted me to this product. I have normal-dry, acne-prone skin. This sunscreen does not leave a white cast.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"This is the only SPF I can use. It's completely non-greasy, non-smelly, doesn't break me out and is just the slightest bit moisturizing so it's perfect under makeup. I have been using this daily for 3 years. I have had some problems with the packaging where the pump was not working straight out of the box. This was frustrating because the bottle doesn't open so there's no way to get the product out. I finally figured out that if you hold the bottle upright and give the bottom of it a good whack on the countertop, it works perfectly after. Must be some air in it that disables the pump. Also, I've noticed some reviews saying that it failed SPF consumer testing. All I know is that I spent all summer at the pool and this is the only thing I used on my face and I never got even a tiny bit bronzed. It seems to work great for sun protection.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ

My normally oily/combination skin becomes calm, perfect, non-oily, non-dry, beautiful skin. To me it's just a bonus that this has SPF at all, its just the best moisturizer I've ever used. I used everything from Laura Mercier, Murad, DDF, Lancome, Nuetrogena, and so on and so forth. This is the best.",5,2,B002MSN3QQ

"I read an article in a magazine that was written by a female dermatologist and she mentioned that she personally used this sunscreen, so I figured it was a good enough endorsement for me.

I found it on Amazon right away and decided to purchase it and I'm really happy that I did.

Its light, non-greasy and goes on smoothly. I put it on over my daily moisturizer before I apply my foundation. It doesn't ""sit"" on your skin, but rather it rubs in nicely and quickly.

Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase and will continue to use this on a daily basis.",5,2,B002MSN3QQ

It doesn't do that when I don't use other products underneath it or let them absorb first. Makeup over it works fine.

Then i apply Eltamed UV clear, wait for that to dry before applying on my makeup or BB cream. Doesn't make my makeup smear or any other mess. My make up goes on great. I love this!

I used this in the past and everything was good. Therefore i ordered the second time but it make me has pimple. Quite disappointed but i still give it a try some more time to see if it getting better,3,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I ordered this product after doing some research. I have extremely sensitive skin and have to be careful about which products I use. Sunscreen is a must and due to my skin, I have tried a lot. Most sunscreens I used before were too greasy, too fragrant, too sticky, or they irritated my skin. Some were not moisturizing enough and would dry my skin out. I have even using EltaMD since March and it has worked great!!! It's moisturizing, no greasy at all, and does not have a scent. I use this twice a day and have still not run out of the first bottle. A little goes a long way. I received a legitimate product that and had a great experience. I have ordered a second bottle and have no reason to believe it is fake.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"This stuff is great! Great SPF protection, goes on so easily, disappears and moisturizes without being oily. Great ingredients and it goes a long way. LOVE this brand! Very high-quality.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
This product made me break out - I wanted to make sure it was the product and not any other factor. So I used the cream after regular intervals and during each time I broke out. I would not recommend this product. It is harsh and does not good to the skin,1,One,B002MSN3QQ
"Absolutely loooved this product, so great for acne prone skin or sensitive skin. Doesn’t leave a white residue when rubbed in correctly. Never going back to another facial sunscreen, can’t live without this!",5,One,B002MSN3QQ
I’ve tried so many daily facial sunscreens. They either break me out in zits or in rashes. This one is the first one that doesn’t. Praise the Lord.,5,0,B002MSN3QQ
This product gave me hives which has never happened with a product before - I received it twice as the first order got lost and delivered late..the first order had a weird color to it so I opened the second and it was a completely different color/scent.. both gave me hives. Wouldn’t recommend and I don’t have sensitive skin!,1,0,B002MSN3QQ
"Excellent too
Quality sunscreen. Easily
Can be worn under makeup or
On its own. No smells and very light, not oily. Highly recommend!",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
This is the best sunscreen for face! Clear and light weight. I can't believe Walmart is now selling it! I used to have to get through dermatologist website. So happy with that and it's cheaper!! I wear everyday on face to keep my skin looking healthy and young....to protect against sun damage.,4,One,B002MSN3QQ
"Been using this for more than 10 yrs. haven’t found any other product as good. It’s nice day light, disappears quickly. My skin feels smooth and I’ve noticed the sun spots and texture is so much better. I suffer from adult acne sometimes and this is the only sunblock I feel does not contribute to it, actually helps with it. I have oily t zone but living in Vegas, the dry air has helped, and this product moisturizes without leaving any oiliness.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"Soon after using the product, my face swelled up. It became very itchy and red. Few more days later, my cheeks got scabs on them and my lips started oozing liquid. I had to go see a doctor and found out that I'm highly allergic to this product. I stopped using the product few months ago but my lips have never recovered. I normally don't have allergic reactions to anything. This is the first time in my life I was allergic to something. I wouldn't recommend this sunscreen.",1,One,B002MSN3QQ
"I’ve sensitive skin/rosacea, ISO a sunscreen product that gave great sun protection, didn’t burn my skin or eyes. This product goes on smoothly (no stinging) and the end of day my dry/sensitive eyes feel like eyes not embers. Sl whitish cast from zinc, smooth non goopy application.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"Okay, so my skin reacted really poorly to this. Be careful if you have sensitive, acne-prone skin. I actually really liked this at first, it felt smooth on and didn't make my skin look greasy. However, almost immediately I started getting cystic acne in places I don't even normally get pimples (my cheeks and under my freaking eyebrow, for one). This stuff is supposed to be for people it's acne-prone skin, so I didn't think that was the cause at first. I caved and stopped using it and my skin stopped breaking out. Bleh. What a waste of money.",1,2,B002MSN3QQ
"The pump dispenser design is different than past bottles I have bought from this company. After a month, the dispenser part broke and I can't fix it and I can only get a tiny bit of lotion out. The return window closed and I have most of the lotion left and I can't get it out of the bottle. The new bottle design is terrible. I also contacted the company and they told me that I can only contact amazon to fix it and that they are not ""affiliated with amazon and therefore can't help me."" I found this to be very disappointing as this is a design flaw. The lotion works very well, so I will purchase again, but if the pump design is the same (more rounded and short) I will return it right away.",1,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I’ve tried a lot of facial sunscreens and nothing comes close this EltaMD sunscreen. I first bought it at a dermatologist office, but found it for much cheaper on Amazon. There is no white residue, it truly goes on clear and it works.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"The best face sunscreen out there! I have sensitive skin that will react and breakout or itchy bumps at a lot of face products...not with this. I’ve probably tried over a dozen face sunscreens and this by far surpasses all of them. Lightweight, super easy to apply, doesn’t leave a chalky white residue, great sun protection all while providing the perfect amount of moisture. This stuff is well worth the price.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
Loved how easy it is to apply. It is non-irritating and has a light finish. Doesn't make my oily skin shinier. Feels moisturizing without being heavy. No white cast. Not sure how well it protects from both UVA and UVB yet. I've heard some nay-sayers talk about how the filters used may not offer much UVA protection so that keeps me cautious and I may only use on days when indoors mostly.,4,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I use this as a sunscreen only, I don't feel like it does anything for my acne though it's for acne prone skin. My skin was breaking out much worse after using this and I wasn't sure if this was causing it. I've added a benzoyl peroxide ointment to my face regimen along with this as the sunscreen, and no more breakouts! You will need to apply a moisturizer before using this.",4,2,B002MSN3QQ
"I buy this for the quality and coverage. My facial lady recommended it, and I like that it’s light weight, not greasy, and doesn’t have much of a scent. I mix it with my non-spf face cream and it mixes well. Absorbs pretty quick and I’m able to wear under my make up with no problems.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
I typically have problems with other facial sun screens stinging my eyes when I'm running. Not a problem with this product. And have never encountered a sunburn even with the Texas sun!,5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"LOVE this. It is actually clear without a white cast, non-scented, and doesn't make me break out. It's not sticky and feels light.

Just be warned that it is not compatible with all moisturizers! When using with CeraVe, I would find the product peeling/balling off my face. This happened no matter which I applied first or how well the first product absorbed into my skin before applying the second product. I would recommend using this in combination with an EltaMD moisturizer that is specifically labeled as compatible with EltaMD suncreens.",5,One,B002MSN3QQ
"Absolutely love this product! everyone should give it a try. I originally got it from my dermatologist. It is great for sensitive skin (I have rosacea and am sensitive to fragrance/certain chemicals), but also great for normal skin. It is spf 46, but does not feel like sunscreen at all. It feels like a light moisturizer, absorbs quickly, no greasiness. Most daily lotions with spf are only 15, so 46 is great! I use it every single morning. Because it is a light moisturizer, I will usually apply a thicker moisturizer underneath if my skin is dry. It sounds pricey for a small bottle, but you only need a little and one bottle will last a long time",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"This sunscreen is very light weight and blends in quickly. I am very fair and the high SPF is imperative to me but I am also prone to breakouts and am very careful with what I put on my skin. My friend recommended this product to me after her dermatologist recommended it to her. I am sort of on the fence with this one. I just got back from a week's vacation where I used this daily and definitely experienced a new breakout towards the end of the week. That said, I don't know if this sunblock was what caused it and I didn't get burned at all wearing this. It also leaves a faint white cast to the skin. I will continue to use intermittently and see what happens.",3,2,B002MSN3QQ
"I don't love this as much as the cult followers do, but I can see why they like it. It is a little too greasy for my liking. Overall it is nice though",4,One,B002MSN3QQ
"I liked the fact that this product is very lightweigh. It absorbs quickly, it is not greasy and it does not have a strong odor.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
This is a great sunscreen. Goes on directly over medications and I have yet to get a sunburn even after sweating and wiping my face. Goes on white but pretty much disappears. Dries without a 'film' feeling.,5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I recently switched over to the EltaMD UV Clear SPF 46 from the UV Daily because of the hot, humid weather in NYC.
PROS: Easy to apply, lightweight: the UV Clear is less moisturizing than the UV Daily which is a plus if you tend to sweat a lot in the face. No allergic reactions so far, and I do have hyperpigmentation and photosensitive skin if you're curious to know.
CONS: Other customers have complained about the UV Clear flaking off. Yes, the sunscreen does rubbed off if you layered foundation on top. You may want to experiment some more and make it work for you. Most days, I go about bare face except for lip balm and a floppy hat.",4,0,B002MSN3QQ
I don’t have sensitive skin and this is the only sunscreen that broke me out a little. Switched back to my usual brand and had no more skin issues.,3,One,B002MSN3QQ
"Love, love, love this product. I have to wear sunscreen everyday due to my Rosacea. This works like a charm and is not heavy at all!",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"Leaves a ridiculously heavy white cast considering the fact that they chose to call it “clear facial sunscreen.” Falsely named and advertised. Also pills if layered with other moisturizer, serums, and/or makeup. Money wasted.",1,0,B002MSN3QQ
Oh my gosh absolutely terrible product. Had an adverse skin reaction to this sunscreen. Contains Octinoxate which is a terrible chemical for your skin. Rash all over my face and neck where I applied this product. Save your money and buy something else. False advertising and the reviews must not be real.,1,2,B002MSN3QQ
Good sun protection recommended to me by my dermatologist. It seems to help my skin after a whole day wearing it. By the end of the day my skin looks even better than it did when I first applied it. Will be reordering soon.,5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"Elta MD is the only sunscreen I use. Some of them make me itch... Elta MD does not. Besides the sunscreen, there are other moisturizing ingredients. My dermatologist sells this as well. Plus... it's made in Arizona, who else could be better at producing an amazing sunscreen!",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I buy a slightly higher SPF at me doctor's and it really works better. I am not getting enough protection with the ones I just
purchased on Amazon. Very strange because I usually love this product. I'm going back to buying the very slightly higher SPF from my doctor. I am wondering why that one is NOT sold on Amazon. Again, I find that very strange. I am obsessed with protecting my skin from sun damage and I am very disappointed with this product from Amazon.",3,0,B002MSN3QQ
"My dermatologist suggested this product for me and my daughter who has acne-prone skin. The doctor's office sold it for a great deal more money, but I found it on Amazon for a lower price. I use it every day. It absorbs quickly and it doesn't show. I like it.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"Fantastic sunscreen for face, neck and chest. Works well with other products and absorbs quickly and without that horrible white ghost film. I love this sunscreen.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"Sunscreen itself is great and leaves no white cast, however the pump is either defective or I received a used product with very little sunscreen. I've only been using this product for one week and the sunscreen is not coming out of the container any longer. I know I could not have used all the sunscreen bc I've had other sunscreen with the same amount of product and it took weeks for me to finish the product.",3,0,B002MSN3QQ
"Hands down best sunscreen for face. The zinc is the key sun protectant ingredient you want. Also because it’s for acne I find that my makeup looks much better on top of this, I don’t get as oily. I wear it over my regular face moisturizer then apply my makeup.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ

Sadly, I’ll be throwing this product away.",1,0,B002MSN3QQ
"The dermatologist recommended this after I had a laser treatment for rosacea and I needed to be out of the sun for 4-6 weeks. Well, I was going to Florida the following week, so that was difficult. I used this every 2 hours. It not only kept the sun off my face, my skin was amazingly clear (and not just from the laser treatment) after just a week. Plus, it’s so moisturizing, I just use this without an additional moisturizer.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"All that time in the sun with no protection is finally paying off :(
And thanks to my finicky skin I've had a hard time finding a product that offers great protection, doesn't mess with my pores, and doesn't make me look like a ghost. But this is it, plus it even has some other benefits that I'm sure I've forgotten about but the point is, you need sunscreen, you need to wear it, you want your skin to remain great-looking, and you don't want it to clog your pores. I totally recommend this product! It's easy to apply, a little goes a long way, it's not greasy nor is it pasty, goes on clear and it's so lightweight, it's just perfect.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"Even though it's for sensitive skin, I find it still burns and tingles for a few minutes after application. I do like that it's not heavy or greasy.",3,0,B002MSN3QQ
I have a very sensitive skin. I also don't like when sunscreens leave a residue on your skin. This sunscreen absorbs quicky and offers a good protection. I live in Florida,5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"Not only is sunscreen recommended by my dermatologist, but it is recommended by me! This is my go to sunscreen when I expect to be out in the sun most of the day, like playing golf, for instance. I have very fair skin and can burn easily. I never fear that happening when I'm wearing this sunscreen. It is not greasy, absorbs quickly, and works wonderfully well under my makeup. I highly recommend this.",5,One,B002MSN3QQ
"Yes, yes yes--absolutely yes!

I have skin that refuses to be clear without some extra help, so I finally hauled my butt to a dermatologist a couple years ago. She recommended me a new skincare regime, which included this sunscreen. Mind you, literally every sunscreen I've used lent to a breakout after just a couple days' use. I have used this product every day for years now--no breakouts! Worth the pricetag, in my opinion.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"No white cast, very little scent, doesn’t break me out. Spent 6 months trying to find a cheaper sunscreen that would work for me but chemical sunscreens break me out and most other mineral sunscreens make you look like a 80’s goth.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ

"I love this brand. My doctor recommended it to me and I am very happy with the facial moisturizer with SPF 46. It goes on nicely, absorbs quickly and is not greasy, which is a big plus for me since my face gets oily easily and I have sensitive skin. I use this as my daily facial moisturizer. I also recently bought the night facial moisturizer so hopefully I like it as well.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I have terribly sensitive skin that reacts poorly to any products with color or fragrance. It is also very prone to acne. When I use products that are meant to fight acne, my skin will dry out and then produce too much oil to compensate, causing pimples to form anyway. This product does not irritate or dry out my skin whatsoever. It does not leave oily residue at all; instead, it makes my skin feel soft and clean. It offers great sun protection- my skin is also extremely sensitive to the sun, and my face is often red all summer from sun damage. This product has helped immensely to give me sun protection without causing a breakout or making my skin feel gross. I am ecstatic that I have found something that works after having tried dozens of other products! Highly recommended, it actually holds up to the claims that it makes.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"This is the lightest sunblock that I could find so far and at a lower price. My dermatologist said that I should use something with zinc, and this one has it. I used to use their other sunblock, but this one is much lighter. It seems to be designed for people with acne, which I do not have, which is probably the reason it is so light. Does not leave the white paste on your face, and is really clear, as it says. Will buy again absolutely.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I had been looking for the perfect daily facial sunscreen for a long, long time until I read about this product on a magazine in the waiting room of my doctor's office. I wasn't familiar with the brand, but I read that it was good for oily skin and the fact that it has an awesome rating on the EWG website gave me the final push to go ahead and order it. Now I just can't leave without it! It's part of my everyday routine and it goes well with my anti-aging facial oil. Believe it or not, I am able to get a matte finish by mixing 4 drops of my oil with a dab of this sunscreen and my skin has a beautiful glow and is protected all day long! I would definitely recommend this product!",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I commute to work, 1.5 hours each way. The sun is on the driver's side when I head to work (rising), and is on the driver's side as I head home (setting). Because of this, I have worn Neutrogena's 50 SPF sunscreen for sensitive skin every day for years. Each summer, once the humidity would set in, I would get acne, especially on my forehead. I finally made the switch to Elta Clear 9 months ago and it has made an enormous difference! My skin is clear, and even though the temperature and humidity are soaring, I haven't seen a hint of even any irritation. It goes on smoothly, and doesn't ever feel heavy or oily. I can't say enough good things about it. It is light, layers under makeup, and my skin has never looked so good!

And it is worth every penny. As far as I am concerned, I'm happy to pony up the $30-something cost if it means I can look great, with no hint of a blemish.",5,One,B002MSN3QQ
"I feel compelled to give this 4/5 stars even though I can't use the product on my face—it's not moisturizing enough for my dry skin. It doesn't purport to be hyper-moisturizing, so I'm not necessarily complaining, just stating a fact. I'm able to use it on my neck without issue, so that's what I've been doing, and it's worked perfectly well. Would absolutely recommend it to anyone with combination, oily, or acne-prone skin (and I might buy it again for my neck, because it's lightweight, absorbs and spreads easily, and doesn't give me neck zits).",4,0,B002MSN3QQ

"This product was recommended by my dermatologist and it's wonderful for acne prone skin. It goes on clear and light and there is no greasy residue. I stopped using this product for a while (switched to the 40 spf version because it was cheaper) and my skin broke out horribly. After starting on this product again after about a year, my skin cleared up and has been great ever since. I put this on my face and neck no matter what the weather or time of year.

"This sunscreen is advertised clearly that it doesn't clog pores and is for acne prone skin. At first, I thought it was my cleansers or serums that had problem. It clogged the pores severely on my cheek, nose, forehead, and chin, and it made me break out badly. I constantly had to get professional help for my skin. Once I switched to a new mineral sunscreen, my face starts to clear up and no more clogged pores. This sunscreen is not made for acne prone skin at all. It turns your skin to acne prone.",1,0,B002MSN3QQ
"This sunscreen is amazing! It goes on like regular moisturizer/lotion (read: no gross oily feeling afterward), and actually keeps you from getting sunburned! Our family put it to the test this weekend as we were out all day in the sun and it was amazing! We did have to reapply, like you do with every single sunscreen, but it was still fabulous. I even dabbed it on over my makeup without too much trouble and it worked great.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"Last summer I was diagnosed with rosacea. Redess, blemishes, you name it. I was miserable. I love the outdoors, but go me! Sun aggravates my rosacea. So does every sunscreen product and moisturizer with sunscreen in it. I was desperate and willing to try anything including a $20+ bottle of sunscreen recommended by my dermatologist, though I was skeptical this would actually help me considering the graveyard of half-used product that did nothing for me but make the redness and blemishes worse.

Now, I use Elta 46 SPF Clear DAILY. I never leave the house without applying. It goes on smooth and I let it dry before applying my makeup. It did not cause any additional breakouts. I was outside most weekends this summer and with the exception of a few occasional spots on my nose, the rosacea stayed at bay all summer. I didn't even sunburn. I am THRILLED.

Don't use too much or you can't rub it all in--you will feel greasy and it will leave white streaks on your face. I use one squirt for my face and throat and an additional half squirt if I need to cover my neck. (For the rest of my I can use regular sunscreen.) One bottle lasts a good 2-3 months. LOVE IT.",5,One,B002MSN3QQ
"Works really well for my skin. I have very oily acne prone skin and it doesnt cause me to breakout or add to my oil production. It leaves my skin moisturized and with a nice healthy dewy glow!

works very well underneath makeup as long as you give it time to settle into your skin! if you apply makeup right after using this product you will experience some flakiness (from the sunscreen and whatever base makeup you applied) but once you let the sunscreen absorb into your skin youre good to go!",5,0,B002MSN3QQ

I didn't open the new product until the other had run out, and now it is too late to return. It is next to impossible to open and close this container to use it without the pump, so I basically can't use it. Not to mention that that is unsanitary, which is why I choose products that can be dispensed as opposed to dipping fingers/hands into it. I will definitely not purchase from this seller again as I now have no form of recourse and a fairly expensive skin product I cannot use.",1,0,B002MSN3QQ

And I have gone on walks at various times in the day and the small amount I put on in the morning still keeps me protected. I give it the highest recommendation possible.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
Great sunscreen that does not feel thick. It absorbs nicely into your skin and feels good even under make-up.,5,One,B002MSN3QQ
This is the best sunscreen for my oily face! I put on moisturizer first then this sunscreen because it is rather drying. It doesn’t feel greasy or oily like most sunscreens . It whitens and protects at the same time. It glides onto my skin when you put it on.,4,0,B002MSN3QQ
"The best sunscreen for face I’ve ever had! Very gentle and pleasant smell, excellent skin protection, absorbs very well. I highly recommend this sunscreen for people with sensitive skin.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
My dermotologist sold this to me years ago and I've used it - prefer the tinted and have never had a bad reaction to it. I'm in my 70's and hobby is working outside in my garden. Product works!,5,One,B002MSN3QQ
My dermatologist recommended this brand since I have rosacea. It’s helped a lot with the redness and it’s not sticky or greasy.,5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"This is one of my favorite daily sunscreens on the market. It absorbs quickly without leaving a whitish cast so that makeup application on top of it is very easy. I love that it also contains great anti-aging ingredients like niacinamide to help brighten my skin. I am a long time user of Japanese sunscreens because they provide high SPF protection while absorbing quickly. Elta MD offers the same protection but without the high alcohol content of some of the Japanese brands. This is a great sunscreen for those who have combination skin and want a high SPF, all day protection.",5,One,B002MSN3QQ
I love how this lotion feels. It's very light and drys without leaving a shine. I can't even tell there is SPF in it. Often my skin breaks out from SPF but not with this one. I highly recommend.,5,0,B002MSN3QQ
The only product I have found that doesn't irritate my face,5,One,B002MSN3QQ
Feels really refreshing and doesn’t have an overbearing sunscreen smell. My dermatologist recommended it and yes you can wear it under makeup.,5,One,B002MSN3QQ
My dermatologist recommended this for me. I bought it from their office but found it cheaper here. It has a very light scent that dissipates after it’s on your face. It lasts a long time because you only need to use a little of it.,5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"Was extremely greasy and caused a nasty break out. Not water or sweat resistant, so it did no good when we were out in the 80 degree weather. And way too expensive for the little amount that you get. Will not recommend to others or buy again.",1,0,B002MSN3QQ
"My favorite face sunscreen ever. Goes on super light, is easy to spread, and does not feel greasy. My skin has reacted positively and I have not experienced any breaking out from this. It contains 5% high-purity niacinamide so my complexion has actually improved.

Facial sunscreen is essential to protect your skin and slow the aging of your complexion. If you're in the market or need a new brand, spring for this one.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ

"Product gets a 5.
Packaging gets a 1.

This is far ans away the best sunblock I've ever used. The problem is that more than half of the bottles (7/10) I've ordered have a DYSFUNCTIONAL PUMPING mechanism. After a few pumps, the mechanism simply stops working - I push and nothing comes out.

The bottle is sealed in a way that I've had to resort to using pliers to pry the bottle open and painstakingly transfer the product into another container. It's a hassle and a mess and it's not what I expect to see from a product of this quality.

I'm surprised not to find more reviews from people who've had this experience because it's happened to me over and over, with bottles purchased in several orders over the course of a year. I kept thinking it was just a defective batch of bottle but then it happened again. Boo!",1,3,B002MSN3QQ
"I dislike this. I wanted to like it but I just don’t. Once it dries, it you touch your face, it is gooey snd crumbles into clumps. Like it never fully soaks in",1,0,B002MSN3QQ
"Would be absolutely perfect without the Niacinimide. Unfortunately it irritated my skin horribly: I had a bumpy rash for weeks on my face, neck, and chest until I figured out what it was. I was able to use it up on my arms, but can't let it touch my face. I love Elta products but won't repurchase. Please make a version with no niacinimide!",4,One,B002MSN3QQ
"I'm not sure if I recieved a fake product, or I was just allergic. I tested on my wrist, everything seemed okay 24 hrs later. So, I used the product on my face. The next day my eyes were swollen shut and my face and neck are red and swollen. I would attach a picture but its embarrassing lol. I was so excited to use this, it went on smooth and no white cast. I wont ever be using it again unfortunately.",1,0,B002MSN3QQ
"Good, hygienic packaging with an easy to use pump. I got this because I have acne prone skin, and in the past, have suffered sunscreen-induced zits for sun protection. I'm so happy I found a dermatologist recommended sunscreen for this price.

The white cast is very slight, barely noticeable. It's got a just-right consistency--not too runny like Biore Aquarich and not too tacky and thick like Alba Botanicas or Derma E.

My skin feels a bit dry after using it, but it's nothing a bit of face lotion won't fix.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"The only sunscreen lotion I'll ever put on my face. Not only is the application light, but it does not give me that disgusting oily shine that other suncreen lotions have done in the past. I have very acne prone skin, and this lotion has helped my skin from acting out. I have used this product for nearly 6 months and my overall skin complexion has gotten noticeably better. I only apply this once in the morning and I can feel it working throughout the day. This lotion is a must have in your purse ladies!",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
Best sunscreen for everyday use. Feels like moisturizer. I use their waterproof version for sports,5,0,B002MSN3QQ
The best thing about this is it didn't leave that zinc feel on my face! Worked wonderfully in day to day use.,5,0,B002MSN3QQ
Absolutely wonderful makes my skin feel nice and goes on cleanly with no white sheen. I have tan skin so other products show up and I was so relieved with this one not doing that. Not to mention its not tacky on my skin.,5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"Not too oily, which is my number 1 pet peeve of most facial sunscreens. My skin is oily enough as is (aka I suffer from acne), I don’t need any more oil! I add it on top of my normal moisturizer and it’s a perfect addition. Goes on nicely, no leftover residue and not added oil!",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"Been using this stuff for years. Helps prevent worsening melisma, isn’t sticky at all drys quickly too. It’s expensive but it does last a long time and really works! I keep one in my purse and one at home!",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"This was recommended to me as I have very sensitive acne-rosacea skin. I've never reacted well to sunscreens - chemical or mineral - but I'm super pale and need to protect my skin! Unfortunately, this had the same effect on my skin as any other sunscreen - major breakout. It also seems to run off very quickly, especially if walking around Nola in the summer for example... I will say, at least it didn't smell bad, went out light and non-greasy, and didn't feel itchy/burny while wearing.",2,0,B002MSN3QQ
"My absolute favorite sunscreen. It is light and not greasy. I use it as my moisturizer, not only sunscreen. Does not make your face oily, and is gentle enough for sensitive skin.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"This is a great SPF if you're just looking for a basic SPF. It provides great coverage/protection, and lasts most of the day. However, I was a bit disappointed to find out that it does not give you much in the way of moisture. I guess I've gotten used to facial sunscreens that give you a big moisture boost, but I was expecting a bit more out of an expensive product like this. Now, you can put moisture on separately, but that's time I'd like to spend doing something else. I did see that they have a version that provides more moisture so once I finish using this up I'll probably give that one a shot.",3,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I needed SPF with no white cast that would not break me out. This did the trick! It's a bit pricey and a small bottle, but you only need a little dab. This bottle will last a long time. Great buy!",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"This is recommended by my dermatologist. In the summertime, I use this over my serum..no additional moisturizer needed.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I have been using this for years. I have fair, sensitive skin and I can only say good things about this product. We moved a few years ago and our new doctor recommend it and was thrilled when I told him I've been using it for years. I highly recommend it.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"After searching for years, I have finally landed on this excellent sunblock for oily skin. Highly protective, I use it on my face and apply a dusting of powder. The finish stays for hours and it has a very high level of both a clear zinc oxide and niacinamide, an ingredient of great benefit for the skin. Most sunblocks with (is it 9%?) zinc oxide look awful on my somewhat darker skin. This is my second order of this product, and I plan to keep it in stock.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"This is absolutely the best sunscreen I have used. It goes on light and non-greasy, and never leaves a white cast on my face.
It goes on flawlessly under foundation, too. What other sunscreen can you say that about?

I have skin that is very prone to redness and irritation, but I actually look forward to putting on my Eltamd sunscreen, because it calms and moisturizes my skin. Pop it in the fridge for a nice chilling effect, it feels great on summer days!",5,One,B002MSN3QQ
"This sunscreen goes on clear and does not leave my skin feeling greasy or shiny looking. The thing I like most about this product is that it does not have the harsh vapors and scents I've experienced in many other sunscreens. I have sensitive eyes that would get irritated from the fumes of other sunscreens, often resulting in a headache. I no longer have that problem since switching to this sunscreen. The product is on the pricier side, so I only use it on my face (a little goes a long way). For me, it's well worth the cost to avoid the headaches and irritation I've experienced from other products. Overall a great daily facial sunscreen.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"This is the best SPF I have tried so far. It's light, it doesn't pill up, it didn't make me break out, and works well under makeup. I initially thought this was expensive but I will purchase again as it works well with my skin.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
My dermatologist recommended this brand. It's expensive but unlike all the many others I've tried it goes on clear and gives great SPF (46) protection. Doesn't seem to sting the eyes during the day. My skin is sensitive but this doesn't seem to affect that condition in the least.,5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"Definitely worth the cost as a daily facial sunblock...it's not too heavy...it leaves the slight ""white"" residue that most sunblocks leave behind BUT if you take the time to massage the product in your skin that will be diminished. I also have sensitive acne prone skin and I am happy to report that I have been wearing it for a month with no breakouts. I also live in the Caribbean so it's definitely getting a true test in protecting my skin during sun exposure lol.",4,2,B002MSN3QQ
"Tengo mi piel súper grasa, y dude en ponermelo xq cuando lo pones en tus manos se siente como una crema normal, pero al aplicarlo en mi rostro se siente muy hidratante y súper fácil de disbuirlo ... Me encanta , su olor es muy suave y deja la piel suave y sin brillos...... Lo súper recomiendo para pieles grasas",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I really wanted to like this sunscreen because it was so highly rated. It did go on nicely and did not leave a white film like many other mineral sunscreens. However, my skin just wouldn't tolerate it. Started burning almost immediately and left skin red and irritated after two days of use.",2,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I've tried at least a dozen sunscreens for my sensitive skin on my face. This product is the only one that didn't leaving a stinging sensation after putting it on my face or made my eyes burn if I accidentally rub them. It's also not greasy at all and rubs in well (no white streaks). It's water resistant, but I always reapply every half hour if I'm in the water and every hour or so if I'm just out and about in the sun. I love that it comes in a pump so I don't have to shake or thump a bottle to get sunscreen out.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"My husband is a farmer and has had melanoma twice so sunscreen is a must. We've tried everything on the market but he's has issues with redness,stinging and discomfort on his face after a 16 hr day in the fields. Not with this product!! He will never use another type of sunscreen after this. It goes on easily, invisible and non sticky. There is no skin irritation after working and wearing a cap/ hat all day. No strong odor either.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"Having sensitive and acne-prone skin, I am very careful when choosing skincare products. This sunscreen works beautifully! First of all, it calms my skin. Second, it kinda evens out my skin tone and fades red marks on my face. Last, it protects my skin from the sun, duh.

Buy it. I swear by this.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ

The product also moisturizes without feeling heavy or greasy. I'm very impressed and will definitely buy again.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"This applies very smoothly, absorbs quickly and very little smell. I have sensitive skin that is allergic to quite a few sunscreens and this one is very gentle and I have had zero reactions. Much cheaper than the Supergoop city serum I was using before this purchase. Will likely repurchase.",5,One,B002MSN3QQ
"I love this sunscreen. My absolutely favorite. I will not go out of the house without it. It doesn't feel like sunscreen and doesn't hurt my eyes when I am in a workout sweat. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it. The best I have ever used in all of my 40 plus years of wearing sunscreen.",5,One,B002MSN3QQ
"After trying many many sunscreen products I now only buy this Elta MD product. It moisturizes and provides sun protection. It does not leave any white residue like the zinc products do. Even my young children use this product without looking like they have white cream on their skin or any other issues. Also, we like that this sunscreen does not have the harmful chemicals other products contain.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
It seems this product crystallizes or something after being on the face for an hour. I'll touch my face to feel it and it starts to rub off. I can only give an anology of being in the ocean then rubbing off the salt that is left behind. I stopped using it after 3 weeks.,1,0,B002MSN3QQ

"This is the best sunscreen for acne-prone skin! I really noticed an improvement while using this as well. My skin looks smoother and more clear. I still had to add just a dab of my moisturizer to this, especially since I use a high percent retin-a micro. I wish there was a clear window to view how much product is left. I seemed to use the product pretty quickly. I am a black woman with deep complexion and the usual sunscreen cast was not bad for me.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ

I have an exceptional sensitivity to chemical sunscreens so I am forced to use only physical sunscreen with one exception (for some reason I can tolerate octixionate -sp-) There is always a catch-22 with physical sunscreens. Either they are so opaque you appear to be ghostly or if its not opaque the spf is so low its not worth using. The Eltamd UV Clear is phenomienal. I put it on under my makeup. In the summer it even provided enough moisture for my skin so I only needed to use it alone without a moisturizer. Bottomline I highly recommend it!,4,One,B002MSN3QQ

"This is the lotion that my dermatologist gives out as samples... which speaks to the high quality! This stuff is awesome, goes on clear, sets a nice stage for make-up, and leaves zero oily residue. I use many topical and oral prescriptions to keep my face breakout free which in turn makes it very sensitive, and this product does not irritate my face at all! The only negative is that the product does have a slight ""sunscreen smell"", however it isn't super strong and definitely is worth it!",5,0,B002MSN3QQ

"I am in my early 30s with very oily, acne prone skin. I didn't think that SPF protection and acne prone skin could live in harmony until my doctor put me on a skin regimen that included this product. I have been a faithful user of this stuff for 2 years and nary a breakout. I think it has helped fade older hyperpigmentation too. One minor issue is that I tend to look shiny after an application but I don't mind since I wear foundation and powder most days. As long as they make this I am buying it.",5,One,B002MSN3QQ

Great coverage and perfect for my sensitive skin.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"First day wearing it. Perfect. Not greasy like other sunscreens that lay on top of your face. This stuff absorbs into your skin like a good moisturizer. I don't wear foundation, but I do mix it with my tinted moisturizer/illuminator. It is white coming out of the bottle, but does not stay white once applied. I have a dark complexion like Queen Latifah and there is no white residue at all! Finally. Yes, it is more expensive than what you would find in the drug store, but for me, it is worth it. Something I can wear everyday knowing that I'm not looking like I stuck my face in talcum powder.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"Amazing sunscreen product, I received a “good” batch cannot relate to the other bad reviews on Amazon, but that doesn’t say you may receive a “good” batch as i did, since there is a discrepancy with other Amazon reviews on this item.

So I know it's beyond a month but can I still return it!?!?!?",1,0,B002MSN3QQ

I took a trip to the British Virgin Islands last summer, and I applied the product to my face every morning before going out into the blazing sun. (My skin is fair and is prone to burning.) I found that the sunscreen lasted all day. I was basically at the beach everyday from 11 AM to 7 PM. I spent some time in the water, but I tried not to get my face wet. Of course water still got splashed on it anyway, but I didn't notice any effect on the sunscreen.

One tip is to apply a thick coat, but make sure it gets absorbed.

Also, I took off one star because it didn't give me as much moisterization as I was hoping for. Overall though, a wonderful product!",4,0,B002MSN3QQ

This has been an absolutely lifesaver, while my skin still gets oily, it doesn't break me out or flake or leave white streaks! Absolute lifesaver.",4,0,B002MSN3QQ

This is my favorite face sunscreen. Esp for those of us like myself who have issues with rosacea/redness. No irritation whatsoever. I know others have reviewed that this seems to peel.....I've only seen that happen to me like 3 times. The key for me is to not use a ton....which I know is kind of defeating the purpose.

Its pretty thin compared to other screens Ive tried so I really like that, especially since I have naturally very oily acne prone skin anyway. The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is because, although its thin and not as coating, it would be much better if it had some type of oil mattifying ingredient such as the ""clean start"" matte spf 15 by Dermatolgica. Now I love that spf but its not strong enough for the protection I need. I continuously undergo an aggressive acne and exfoliating treatment, which occasionally includes; chemical peels, dermabrasion, lasers and etc. (not all at once and not close after one another of course).

Anyhow...I would definitely recommend this product.",3,0,B002MSN3QQ

"This sunscreen is great... if you’re white. Was excited to finally find a facial sunscreen that was moisturizing and wouldn’t leave me looking like a ghost. Unfortunately, I was wrong. While subtle, this sunscreen will give you a white cast over your skin and leave you looking dull. My skin is ordinarily vibrant, vibrant and glowy.

"PROS:
lightweight
great SPF

CONS:
greasy - my face is shiny after applying
still makes me break out

I wanted to love this product and had high hopes based on the reviews.

This particular product barely has scent. It sinks into your skin even though you feel you might have put way too much. My dermatologist tells me that people don't put enough to be effective, but how can you when the product just sits on your face? This product you can put as much as you want and it soaks in. I know I'm really protecting my face! It is a bit expensive for the size of the bottle (1.7oz), but I will be asking too much!",5,0,B002MSN3QQ

Between the two I'm confident I get protection from the sun while experiencing ""break-out"" free skin. My dermatologist recommended UV clear, I'm eternally grateful.

EltaMD UV clear is the only sunscreen I will use on my face now. I have very fair skin and light eyes so I have to be really careful about sunscreens. I like this because it's both a chemical and a physical sunscreen so it keeps me protected throughout the day quite well. Also the zinc and niacinamide are soothing to my skin. Sits great under my MAC studio fix makeup and there is no visible cast once you rub it in (and it rubs in so easily!) You won't want to use anything else after this!,5,0,B002MSN3QQ

My regimen consists only of washing my face, applying moisturizer, and finally sunscreen. I have combination skin. Oily T-zone. During the winter a bit dry. Of course I get the occasional acne too. I've tried several facial sunscreens that are oil free and for acne prone skin. They all felt very heavy, left my face very shiny and even more oily. After reading reviews decided to give this a try. What I like is its in a pump. One little squirt does the trick so no waste. The color is a light cream color but rubs on clear. It feels so light weight on my skin and does not look shiny at all! I've only had it a few days but so far am so very impressed. I haven't had a breakout yet and I almost always do when trying new products.

I have been using it for a few days now. So far it is great! It is oil free and I have seen so much difference in my skin. I have very oily skin. Most sunblock reinforces the prodcution of oil which of course will later cause breakouts due to the accumulation of more dirt. I really am very picky with skin creams. This is more costly compared to any other sunblock purchased at stores but it is a quality product. The only problem is that the bottle is small and I am sure to finish the bottle quickly.

"I don’t have sensitive skin at all but definitely acne prone which is why I bought this particular product. Anything with spf has always made me break out. Well this one is no different. I got pimples everywhere on my face from it and a few cystic ones I haven’t had for years. I take very good care of my skin and cleanse properly so I’ll have to stop using this and maybe save it for my neck, chest or body.",2,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I noticed that a lot of these reviews are written only after the first few uses of the product so I wanted to have more use out of it before giving my opinion. Before I get into reviewing I will mention what type of skin I have to give others an idea of what they might expect.

Acne has never been a serious problem for me like for some family members of mine. I rarely have more than 4 zits on my face at a time, but I probably spend about 4 months out of the year with zits on my face. I get ugly brown freckles from the sun (and not the cute kind) so I try to wear sunscreen, but it doesn't seem to matter what type I try and I've tried a LOT- whether they are non-clogging or oil-free or super light or sprays or sticks or lotions or soaps (yes I've even tried the sunscreen soaps) they all seem to make any existing acne on my face worse. IF I keep a healthy skin regimen I can usually use these sunscreens without them causing acne.. but once I already have it- pfft. Forget it. ANYTHING you put over those blemishes aside from acne medication or water makes it worse. I usually have to wait for the blemishes to dissappear completely before I can start using sunscreen on those areas again, or else they will never dissappear.

What I'd really like is a Sunscreen that doesn't just claim to not cause acne but actually CLEARS acne. Only because in my experience- products that just claim to not cause acne... end up causing it anyway or at least making the ones you already have worse. Products that aim to TREAT acne (such as certain makeup products that clear up acne while providing coverage) either clear it up or simply prevents it from getting worse. Such a sunscreen is difficult if not impossible to find. Probably because the acids used to clear up acne would only eat through any sunscreen product anyway.

But when I ordered this I was hoping that maybe they finally got around that problem. Because I ordered this with the hope that it would either help clear existing acne OR KEEP IT FROM GETTING WORSE. I personally have not found this to be the case. It IS the lightest sunscreen I have ever experienced. 5 minutes after putting it on you feel like you just washed your face with water only- It really is THAT good. So light it actually makes you feel you have nothing on and makes you wonder whether there's any actual protection from the sun at all. When I first started using this I was so surprised how good and light it felt that I became very excited thinking I have finally found 'the one'! But now that I've been using it for a few weeks it's become apparent that using this product daily over existing acne gives me the same problem that other products do. Just makes the acne that's already there worse. Perhaps not as bad as my other sunscreens- but still worse than with no sunscreen at all.

In conclusion- I think this is a great product if you have oily skin and are prone to acne because I do not think it will CAUSE acne to appear. However if you already have acne on your face and are hoping this is a sunscreen you can use over your already-acne'd skin without making what's already there worse (ie larger or cystic) , you will probably be dissappointed. So just like my other 'skin-clearing' sunscreens, I have to shelve this product whenever I have an outbreak.",3,2,B002MSN3QQ

Don’t know if the product is real but it broke me out. Stoped using it. Waste of money.,1,One,B002MSN3QQ
It doesn't play well with other skin care products. I've tried it with my usual products as well as samples of other ones trying to find a combination that doesn't cause my face to look like it's peeling and my clothing to look like I have a bad case of dandruff.,2,3,B002MSN3QQ
This is the best I’ve found for sensitive acne prone skin. And my purchase here does appear to be the genuine Elta product. It has a printed serial number and performs equally in my experience.,5,0,B002MSN3QQ
"I love this stuff! It really feels like a moisturizer, not a sunscreen, and doesn't smell like sunscreen either. It has never broken me out, made me feel greasy, or effected the look of makeup. It's also really hard (for some reason) to find sunscreens with decent ingredients, but this one is great.

I loved it right away, but didn't want to review it until I knew it was effective. It feels so much like a moisturizer, that it was hard to believe it would actually block the sun. Well - I wore this, and only this (not even makeup) on my face for a day out in the sun recently. I got red on my shoulders, neck, and everywhere else up top that I didn't have sunscreen on, but my face was completely unphased.

There's really something to be said for the feel/smell of something like this. I didn't think I would care much, but the fact that it feels good on my skin actually motivates me to wear it every day. It has also lasted a long time. I ordered this March 8th, and it's now August 3rd and I'm still on my first bottle. One pump is just a little bit more than I need to cover my whole face.

The packaging is great too. I love that it's a pump (that works well) and has a cap that actually stays on. That, and the size of the bottle, make it easy for me to keep in my purse so there's no excuse to be without it.",5,3,B002MSN3QQ

"Got a tester!!!

"SUNSCREEN: 5 stars. It's a nice compromise between a purely chemical sunscreen (which I'm trying to avoid) and a purely physical sunscreen that often shows up with a white cast or pills under makeup. Also has niacinamide, which is nice since it's good to layer different products with nicacinamide since they often don't appear in effective concentrations within any one product.

PACKAGING: 1 star for the terrible airless pump, which doesn't seal correctly (and caused some of the product to leak during shipment). The pump quit working on my second use. I was able to fix it by placing tape around the joint (area above the label) to fix the vacuum seal, but it's still annoying the packaging isn't manufactured correctly.",3,One,B002MSN3QQ
"Light scent of suntan lotion but not bothersome. I have allergies to all scented products and I have super sensitive skin. Very happy with this moisturizer, no allergic reactions and my skin didnt break out. Only qualm I have is that it speeds my already oily skin to getting oilier faster. Still not a deterrent. My top notch derm said that the best moisturizers for anti aging are those that have a good amount of zinc oxide and this one does. Very happy and definitely recommend.",5,0,B002MSN3QQ
I went to the dermatologist and I paid a couple hundred dollars on oral medicine and topical medicine. And this sunscreen my Dr recommend it to me.

"I'm a 26 year old lady with sensitive, acne prone skin. I have been reluctant to start using anything regularly because of the breakouts sunscreen has given me since my teenage years.

After wrangling my acne problem I have been determined to protect my skin and finally came upon this sunscreen.

I get mostly air and no product! I bought two bottles at the time, so this will be a costly lesson if the pumps don't work. I contacted the manufacturer and EltaMD said that they do not communicate with consumers, so you're only recourse is to talk to your seller.

Upon 1st use this feels like nothing but zinc oxide and it has difficulty absorbing into the skin. I know what the other ingredients consist of and feel like on my skin, and it's hard to believe they are present; I refer to the ceramides and hyaluronic acid, I just dont think they're in there. Disappointed.",1,127,B00F97FHAW
I like the CeraVe product line and use the night cream and it’s great but I think the SPF is the problem here; my skin instantly broke out in little bumps all over my cheeks after the first application.

"So I finally ran out of sample sunscreen moisturizers from higher-end brands like Elizabeth Arden (which are great btw if you want to pay $50 per tube), and I wanted to try something less expensive. After trying a few other brands commonly found at CVS, I found that most sunscreen moisturizers either don't absorb that well with an annoying pilling issue, or don't have a high enough SPF.

This sunscreen really does the trick, and I love that it has ceremides in the ingredients. I just use toner + this sunscreen in the morning and my skin stays moisturized throughout most of the day. One pump is enough for the entire face, too much may leave a residue or give you a pilling problem... I have dry/combination skin, no acne problems.",5,74,B00F97FHAW
"Great, oil-free moisturizer with SPF at a very reasonable price. It does not irritate my sensitive skin but it's made my face noticeably softer.

"This cream is not a moisturizer, it has the same texture as any sunscreen cream would have. It is very white and though my skin is super white it still doesn’t work.
I compared two moisturizing creams, this one and avene. I like the texture of avene better. This cream does not blend into the skin. Really bad.",1,37,B00F97FHAW
"It isn't a complain about the ingredients as they were listed already. But I personally prefer mineral based sunscreen to keep my skin irritation low. This was packaged in very nice to use pump style bottle and I like the bottle design a lot. But as for the content, this sunscreen moisturizer was not as sensitive skin friendly as I hoped for. I can still use this someday, but not all the time. I hope for the brand to come up with sensitive skin formula with mineral based SPF moisturizer. I still love Cerave and their products are just perfect for my skin most of the time, just not this SPF ingredients. No regret, but no repurchase.",4,22,B00F97FHAW
"This moisturizer is such a let down because the ingredients it lists are some of my favorite (hyaluronic acid, niacinamide), the texture of it is nice and non greasy, and it doesn’t make my face look oily like most SPF moisturizers do. It actually looks really nice on the spots where I manage to rub it in all the way - that’s where the caveat lies. This moisturizer is a nightmare when it comes to pulling and flaking off. It literally looks like I rubbed wet toilet paper all over my face with the amount of weird little white flakes and clumps that are all over my face. I have tried to use this moisturizer all types of ways to see if it was just user error - I have tried with and without other products underneath, I have tried rubbing and patting it in. Nothing stops the pilling and flaking from happening. I can’t even imagine how gross it would be if I tried to put makeup over this. I’m very disappointed and definitely returning this because I can’t use it if it’s going to make my face look like this.",2,10,B00F97FHAW
"Works well! I’ve only been using this for a week or so and in the beginning I wasn’t a fan. However, I learned to apply just a thin layer, enough to cover my face and neck. After doing that, it didn’t leave a white cast. It has the typical sunblock smell but it does it’s job! Just don’t over-apply it and you’ll be fine. For context, I‘m Indian and have caramel/peanut butter colored skin. I don’t know how it works for sensitive skin as mine isn’t too sensitive.",5,14,B00F97FHAW
"This is the only Product that has ever left white residue behind on my face. I use multiple products on my face both day and night, and unfortunately this product CANNOT be layered (even putting it on first will produce little white things). So if you’re going to use ONLY this product, go for it. But if you’re using other products with it, I would say to pass. Disappointed because it was my main SPF source recommended by Curology. It also is most likely tested on animals so I’m kinda mad it didn’t work out.",2,10,B00F97FHAW
Before using this product I suffered with mild adult acne. My skin is completely clear now -- my challenge is I have combination skin which ranges from normal to very oily. Before I used an Aveeno moisturizer during the day under my make up and my skin was never completely clear and I had to work very hard to make that product work with makeup. I'd get a new outbreak before the scars from the old outbreak cleared up. I like the fact that the thicker SPF formula absorbs well and plays nicely with make up. I am not sure what features/ingredients of this product cause it to work so well but it does not create a thick oily barrier that works against my very oily skin. I use a different product at night (Garnier's skin active moisture rescue for normal to oily skin). I will never be with out this product for as long as they keep making it.,5,11,B00F97FHAW
"I used this product for three days and by the third day I had to stop due to it doing the opposite of what I bought it for. It is a very thick formula and takes some work to rub it into the skin. I didn’t mind this too much because is did seem to create a barrier to protect my skin from the sun. However, on the first day of using it my skin became very dry and started to peel. Keep in mind I do have very sensitive skin. It’s just annoying to get a product that does the opposite of what I bought it for. It’s a shame because I had heard good things about this product. I thought I would share my experience, in case there any other sensitive skin peeps looking at this product. It’s been a week since I have stopped using the product and my skin is starting to get back to normal. I held off on writing a review because I wasn’t sure if this was what was causing the dryness at first, but after only another patch test I have confirmed that it was due to this product.",1,8,B00F97FHAW
"I have been using the daily moisturizing face and body lotion on my face. When I found this product specifically for the face including sunscreen I decided to give it a try. I really wanted to like it. However, it comes out much thicker than the daily moisturizing lotion, took longer to rub it in so you couldn’t see the white, and it made my skin feel tight and itchy. Will be returning this and going back to the daily moisturizing product.",2,10,B00F97FHAW
"Sadly, this doesn't seem to absorb into the skin-- a smooth white cast would be PREFERABLE because this is uneven and flaky, and it pills off. Honestly super disappointed because this is basically unusable on my face.

I do not have sensitive or dry skin, so this should just glide on, but it doesn't spread well and ends up with uneven coverage and will leave flaky bits that you can't ignore. I didn't even attempt to put makeup on over this as there was no way putting more product on my face would look anything but worse.

What a shame.",1,7,B00F97FHAW
"I used this two mornings in a row, and throughout the second day I developed a rash (lots of tiny white bumps and puffy red skin) on my eyelids and the surrounding area. I’ve never had any issues like that before, with any lotion and/or sunscreen, so this was a total surprise. Really disappointed that I wasted all this money.",1,18,B00F97FHAW
"Pros
– Moisturizes really well.
– Protects from UVB radiation.
– Doesn't smell.
– Comes with a pump.

Cons
– Leaves a white cast.
– Pills.
– Makes my face look sweaty when I'm hot.

Review
I'm finishing my second bottle of this moisturizer, and I really wanted to like it. I like the price and the fact that it's supposed to hydrate and protect your skin from sun damage all in one product, no separate sunscreen needed. And sure, it does hydrate really well: my skin felt silky smooth, and I even got complimented on how supple it was. The moisturizer also doesn't smell – all the more reasons to like it.

But, unfortunately, I couldn't. First of all, it leaves a white cast that is noticeable even on my very pale skin. I also noticed that it tends to pill. The moisturizer absorbs quickly after I apply it, but if I rub it a touch too much to spread more evenly, the sunscreen would ball up and leave patches of white residue on my face. Before applying this moisturizer, I just wash my face with the CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser, yet it still manages to pill. I haven't tried, but I also can't imagine what would happen if I used more products before it.

It also tends to make my face look excessively sweaty when I'm hot. It feels like sweat forms on my face and doesn't go away. It just stays in place, unless I wipe it. This doesn't happen if I don't wear this moisturizer and if I'm not really hot. To illustrate how bad it is, I ran to a friend's place in the winter and got a bit hot. When I came back from washing my hands, my friend asked me if I'd washed my face too. I didn't.

I am also concerned about how well it protects from UVA spectrum radiation. It is supposed to offer broad-spectrum protection, yet the manufacturer doesn't specify the UVA-related ratings, such as PA or PPD, which is expected in the US, but doesn't inform me.",2,6,B00F97FHAW
"Sooo... first of all, I agree with almost every other review on here. I use Cerave almost exclusively on my face and body and this product is a little weird but some of theirs are odd. I use the PM moisturizer and it works great so I decided to try the AM with SPF since I have dry and fair skin. It is VERY moisturizing but it’s consistency is VERY much like sunscreen. I do not use it under makeup for that reason; however it does leave a nice glow (almost dewy), not greasy if you decide to go makeup free.",3,7,B00F97FHAW
My face is always in a battle between being dry and flaky or breaking out. My skin therapist recommended this on the downlow instead of the $80 products her company sells. She says she uses this and loves it. I can see why. It hasn’t caused any breakouts.,5,12,B00F97FHAW
"I ordered this after I heard rave reviews from dermatologists about this product. I also ordered it because I own a bunch of other CeraVe products which I love. I switched from an SPF50 Cetaphil face lotion for this one, and I'm sad I did.
This moisturizer does NOT apply evenly and smoothly on the face... I don't know how exactly to describe it other than it looks like grease paint when applied. It curdles and when it dries, it flakes off making it look like dead skin. I'm sure the product does a great job of protecting against the sun and it IS good for sensitive skin, but definitely not on the face. I'm probably going to use this as a body sunscreen instead of a face moisturizer.",1,5,B00F97FHAW
"Perhaps this was an expired version of the product, but my test usage caused extreme skin irritation.

I’ve previously used this product with no problems when the dermatologist provided me samples directly, but the version that I received from Amazon caused terrible irritation on the area that I tested (wrist) about 24 hours later. I have not had a skin reaction to this magnitude in over 10 years.

The packaging didn’t have a seal when I received it, which I found to be surprising.",1,7,B00F97FHAW
"That's what I said about the CeruVe serum. And, NO, I do not work for CeruVe or any other brand of skin treatment. I hate to repeat myself, so read what I said about their serum. This is only the second moisturizer I've used that goes on white, disappearing in a few seconds. Try this if you have sensitive skin. My skin is only mildly sensitive, except for Strivectin, to which I'm violently sensitive. Sun protection all day, unless, I suppose, you were to be sun-bathing, like we did as teenagers--at least my generation did! I've spent an afternoon in and out of the pool with my granddaughters in Florida with no sun protection lotion on either face or body. I applied CeruVe moisturizer on my face in the morning. My shoulders, arms, back and decolletee burned quite red. My face did not. And I don't wear a hat! This product has no scent. So I had no allergic reaction to that. When somebody walks by me reeking of over-applied 'perfume', I have to reach for my inhaler. Oh, and, a little dab will do ya. No need to slather it on. overall, good product, good price.",5,5,B00F97FHAW
"I use Cers Ve products in general and like the quality very much. I do think this is of good quality as well. Not heavy at all like the cream. Feels non-greasy as stated and I like that is has spf. My only complaint, and it's a deal breaker for me, is that it is NOT fragrance free. The description on Amazon's title for the product, as well as under the details from the manufacturer says it is. My only assumption is that to them fragrance free means that they did not add any fragrances to it. However, this still has a slight sunscreen smell to it which, after putting on in the morning, I can continuously smell for approximately 1 hour. The whole reason I bought this was because it was the only one that says it was fragrance-free with sunscreen. Very disappointed in that. For anyone looking for a lotion for the face that has SPF, but is expecting it to be fragrance-free, this is not as trong as others I have tried and therefore would say it may be the best one, but it still has a fragrance. I started thinking to myself if I was just misunderstanding what fragrance free means. However, as a consumer, I would definitely say this is false advertising or at the very least misleading if they're reasoning happens to be that it's fragrance-free due to them not adding any extra fragrance to it. I would expect it not to smell like anything. Stupid me.",3,7,B00F97FHAW
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 I have been liking the product they got but the last one I received from amazon the pump did not work, even though i must have pumped like 100 times and still no lotion coming out. I checked the inside and looks like it only goes up half way and stuck there. Had to use the old lotion’s top to use for the new one.",3,15,B00F97FHAW
"My dermatologist recommended this to me. I used to have oily skin but it started becoming more dry about 5 months ago. I switched from Cetaphil daily moisturizer and used this CeraVe for a week but every time I used it, my face felt like it was burning. I thought it was just the first day or two but no, every day for a week my face was burning. It also dried out my face pretty badly. Switched back to Cetaphil and all the problems stopped.",1,7,B00F97FHAW
"This Product I would say is decent to good for a person who does not have sensitive skin, or acne prone skin. It does offer great sun protection, but it’s also a combination sunscreen, which my skin did not tolerate well. A few hours after applying the sides of my nose are so itchy and oily, and my face feels like it is slightly on fire the rest of the day , and my T zone is super oily. Granted, I do have oily skin, but I can tell when my skin is irritated, and when it gets irritated. So I’m gonna just completely go over to a zinc sunscreen, that is preferable paraben free. I love this company, they offer great products to a general group of people who want all of the bells and whistles when it comes to a moisturizer and cleanser or even a sunscreen. But, for my skin, I just can’t tolerate their products any more, and I have used this brand for over a year, maybe I’m sensitive to the Parabens in literally all of their products? I recommend Vanicream, much gentler compared to Cerave in my experience to fragrance, or Parabens ZERO irritants.",2,4,B00F97FHAW
"I had high hopes for this product based on the number of positive reviews. What I found is a product that leaves ""threads"" of lotion all over my face and neck. I tried to sweep off the residue but it was impossible to get it all off my skin. I have returned the product and will not recommend or buy again.",1,7,B00F97FHAW
"This product is ok, but I do not care for the scent and the ultra light version is much more gentle on my skin. The sun block works well and overall it isn't too bad, I just prefer the other one. The scent is the biggest turn off for me with this product.",3,11,B00F97FHAW
"I usually am a CeraVe fanatic. I buy all of their products because I have really sensitive skin. I have eczema and dermatitis and CeraVe usually has a really good nonirritating formula. I tried to add this facial moisturizer to my routine after I really liked the nighttime renewing cream. Boy was it a terrible mistake. The following day I had huge patches of dry peeling skin on my eyes, cheeks, chin. Its been 2 weeks and I have gone back to my old moisturizer and it still hasnt gone away. I had a lot of redness the days following that it looked like I had been punched in the face. I do not recommend this one if you have very sensitive skin such as myself.",1,3,B00F97FHAW
"I normally love Cerave, especially their PM moisturizer, but this was a disappointment. The product leaves a heavy white cast that takes as long as body sunscreen to massage in. Also, I often combine moisturizers with other products, either mixing them 1:1 or applying them in rapid succession. This lotion is the only one I've tried that reacted poorly with even non-exfoliating serums, leaving small, rolled, white clumps that looked like dead skin. A few other reviewers posted pictures nailing it.

It then leaves a dewy finish, but you can feel that's it's surface level moisture. When I wash it off with a gentle cleanser at the end of the day, my skin feels dehydrated as if I hadn't been using a moisturizer at all.

The best I can say is that it arrived as described, with a full and undamaged bottle. It also didn't break me out, and I haven't gotten even a touch of sunburn with it on. But Cerave's ""Ultra Light"" alternative is twice as good and worth the price difference.",2,2,B00F97FHAW
"I have hormonal, cystic acne (and taken pretty much every cream and pill for acne at some point) so needless to say my skin is now somewhat sensitive and prone to major outbreaks. My dermatologist has recommended cerave (as well as cetaphil) to use for everyday products such as face cleanser and lotions. This lotion doesn’t seem to cause any outbreaks (or make my face super red after application, which is so nice lol). Also, it is super light and blends in after application. Give it a minute or two after applying and it should be good! It doesn’t make your face smell like sunscreen either which is the only reason why I am still consistent with applying it. My boyfriend even commented on it, and said you could only smell sunscreen right after applying but a few minutes later he didn’t smell anything.",5,3,B00F97FHAW
"Let me say up front, my skin hates CeraVe products. I don't know why, but for some reason every single product by them irritates my sensitive skin. My eyes swelled up after using their face wash, and this moisturizer made me break out in an eczema flare up all over my face. I'm stumped because this brand is dermatologist recommended, and supposedly made for the most sensitive of skin. ANYWAYS, this is a decent sunscreen. SPF 30 is really the bare minimum of what should be on your face, but it does what it's supposed to. It's an awful moisturizer though. It is not nourishing or hydrating AT ALL. I had to apply a separate moisturizer under this product to feel adequately moisturized. It's not fragranced which I like, but it does smells like regular sunscreen. I didn't notice a white cast, but I'm very pale already. I only used this for 3 days, before my skin broke out in an eczema rash all over my face and neck.",2,5,B00F97FHAW
"CeraVe AM Facial Moisturizer is my 3rd favorite product in CeraVe’s facial product line-their Facial Cleanser for oily skin & their PM Facial Moisturizer being my top 2 favs. CeraVe is my go brand for facial products. With having oily skin & at one time acne, I’ve tried many products, some good, some no good. I’ve done a lot of research into what my skin needed for optimal look & health. I’ve always gone back to CeraVe. What they offer in their AM Moisturizer is gold for our skin. The 3 essential ceramides, niacinamide (B3-which helps build skin cells while protecting them from environmental stresses) & hyaluronic acid-which retains water to help the tissues in our skin well lubricated & moist as well as a ton of other benefits!) are 3 key ingredients our skin needs & is in this moisturizer. SPF 30 is a good amount of sun protection for our face. The lotion is scent free. The 3oz. bottle goes a long way for the price. This cream I don’t consider to be lightweight though vs. their PM moisturizer. It’s heavier. This is where it shows like it is more of a sunscreen cream vs. a moisturizer but it is doing nothing. This is the only downside for me with having oily skin. After cleansing & applying my toner & any serum I may use that day I apply this. My skin does react to it in a greasy type of way within 1 hour. That is if I put nothing over the moisturizer. To prevent this from happening I apply my favorite primer once the moisturizer has set in. Then I apply my powder, either loose or compact. Once all of that is in place I see no oil & I know my face has protection from the sun as well as benefiting from all that the moisturizer has. Since Winter hit & I’m not outside, some days never the AM I use the PM moisturizer which is much lighter. Overall this is the perfect moisturizer to entail into your skincare regime. I have it on my subscribe & save list so I save a little extra & order when needed. One bottle lasts me 3 months or longer. I hope this helps to give you an idea as to why this moisturizer is so good. Wonderful quality at an affordable price. Highly recommend!",5,One,B00F97FHAW
LEAVES WHITE FLECKS ON MY FACE,1,19,B00F97FHAW
"This isn't lotion WITH SPF, it IS sunscreen. Waaaaay to heavy for my oily sensitive skin. I put it on and it looks like I just did 40 situps. When I think daytime I think a light moisturizer that I can be seen in public with. I never go in the sun and if I did I would wear sunscreen. I don't need sunscreen as daily lotion. It's nasty. I returned it.

Not for oily skin!",2,5,B00F97FHAW
"I have very dry skin so I bought this for my moisturizer/sunscreen seeing as that's what its advertised for but let me tell you there's absolutely nothing good about this product and I'm actually surprised because I usually like cerave... 1. this stuff pils if I'm spelling that right you literately can't put anything else on with it because it just Goops up but almost into a powder if that makes at sense. 2. it is insanely dry you can't even rub it in before it dries down and the whole point of a ""moisturizer"" is for it to feel moisturizing! 3. you can see it all over your face it doesn't soak in and it completely ruins your makeup because its just blotchy all over your face. long story short absolute worst moisturizer I've ever used wish I didn't spend my money because I already debate buying something at this price. I wish I could get my money back and get the lightweight one",1,5,B00F97FHAW
"Okay... so here’s the thing with this product, it is good, it has quite good ingredients and it feels good on the skin however it leaves a terrible white cast and, as a dark skinned person the product doesn’t really fit me. It is CeraVe and it has its quality but for dark/black skinned people is a no no. Also try to avoid the eyes area because it makes your eyes teary and itches quite a lot (I experienced it in first hand).

Also it is way smaller than what I was expecting and let me give you an advice: this is a “Two in one” product; as it is a moisturizer AND a sunscreen it means that in order to get the SPF that the packaging of the product is claiming you need to use quite a lot of the product because the sunscreen properties are diluted in the moisturizer and as it is this small you’ll find yourself finishing the small little bottle in no time; so that’s something to keep in mind when you buy a sunscreen that has moisturizer in it.
In my very personal opinion, you should go for a product that is moisturizer entirely as well as the sunscreen, don’t play games with sunscreen, it is one, if not the most important step on a skin care routine.",2,3,B00F97FHAW
"This does moisturize my skin well, I like the consistency and smell too. I have really dry skin in certain areas(nose and forehead). I never used any moisturizer before so I bought this brand and cetaphil to try out and see what worked best. I used the cetaphil brand first and I got a very large painful bump on my nose, I thought it could possibly just be a coincidence so I quit using it for awhile and tried the cera v. During the time I used the cera v, I didnt have any breakouts or anything. It moisturizes my skin pretty good too. I figured I would try the cetaphil again. Sure enough the next day I've broken out on my cheeks and forehead! So I wont be using the cetaphil brand again. I'll stick to cera v for now. The cetaphil consistency was more like a cheap lotion. The cera v was similar to sunscreen. Both smell fine too. They have different ingredients, But basically claim the same thing. The cera v worked the best for my skin.",4,2,B00F97FHAW
"I ordered this facial moisturizer to replace one made by CeraVe that is no longer available. I was perfectly happy with the prior product and had been using it for over a year. When Amazon stopped carrying it, I opted for this one, which seemed similar. But when I put it on my face and attempt to spread and rub it in, it flakes all over my face. It doesn't have the consistency I expect with a moisturizer, but feels more like straight sunscreen. I returned it for a refund and will now search other sites for the CeraVe moisturizer for sensitive skin. It contains sunscreen but goes on smoothly.",1,2,B00F97FHAW
"I’m not sure if I got a bad batch or if there is some trick to using this, but every time I’ve tried to put this on my face it balls up in chunks and I have to wash it off. I’ve tried it with no products underneath, and I’ve tried mixing in a little bit of moisturizer to make it smooth out easier. Didn’t work. I love all of their other products, so I’m surprised this one doesn’t work for me.",1,3,B00F97FHAW
"I love Cerave, I use their Daily Moisturizing Lotion and Foaming Face Wash every day. I was so excited for this sunscreen but it was a complete let down. As previous reviews are mentioning, this product dries weird on the face and leaves a white residue and pills up whenever you rub your face. I gave it a few chances but it would not stop pilling up, looked horrible under makeup, and I also think it broke me out. Would not recommend! Sad to see my money wasted.",1,3,B00F97FHAW
"I like the coverage this provides. I purchased it because someone had recommended it as a daily SPF. I won't wear this daily as it's too heavy and thick, but for when I'm going out in the sun it does the job. A little disappointed that I heard it was light and good for daily use, but I don't find that to be true. I have very dry skin, and this sometimes is a little bit cakey. definitely does its job and protects from the sun, so I do wear it when I go out. But not a daily wear.",4,4,B00F97FHAW
"The pump on mine doesn't work, so it's disappointing. It smells like sunscreen and it's thick and VERY oily like one. It also leaves residue on my face... I applied and let it dry, but if I touch my face, dry moisturizer comes off. Ugh, I hate it!!!

UPDATE:
So, Ive been using for 3 days now and my skin is adjusting to the moisturizer. If I put too little, it's not enough. If I put too much it leaves my face white as a ghost. I finally found out the amount so my skin isn't as oily. BUT I am only giving a 3 star because it is thick and it's not oil free as it says it is. I'm not buying it again.",3,3,B00F97FHAW
"I've honestly been brand loyal to this product for at least 3 years if not more. I think I have fairly average skin, but I particularly love how well this lotion ""settles"" into my skin, and doesn't leave my face feeling wet or shiny. Three pumps each morning is all I need - I don't use the PM in addition, and though it's clearly up for debate what percentage is owed to this product, I am genuinely constantly complimented on my skin and complexion and youthful experience.... and literally the only facial product I use is this moisturizer every morning (actually, i wash my face with facial cleanser once a week, but that's it).

I've had issues with other products running into my eyes when I sweat, but that hasn't really been the case with Cerave, although you can inadvertently rub it into your eyes at which point it doesn't feel great...

My skin pretty much feels moisturized for the entire day after applying at ~9am. Definitely recommend giving this product a shot.",5,2,B00F97FHAW
"Not moisturizing enough.

I've used other CeraVe products without any problems so it took several months before I realized it was this moisturizer that was causing the rash & stinging on my face & neck. Within two days of stopping the CeraVe the symptoms started to fade.

On sunny days (in the mild Pacific NW, not the tropics) I had to add another layer of sunscreen.

Very disappointed in this product. I wish I could return it as I probably used less than 20%.",2,4,B00F97FHAW
"I like having moisturizer with spf to shorten my morning routine. I have to rub this in for a minute or so to get rid of the white cast, but it does dissipate with rubbing/patting motions. It’s thick but not as moisturizing as I like, so I find myself using more product or adding a different moisturizer on top, which sort of defeats the purpose. It doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin whatsoever, but I don’t think I’ll repurchase beacause my dry skin needs a bit more moisture. If you are using this just as spf or have oilier skin than me, you would probably really like it. It’s a good product, just not for me",4,3,B00F97FHAW
"I have combination skin and this was too heavy of a cream for me. I tried it because there were several beauty articles that recommended it, but I ended up washing it off because I feel like I had a mask on and my skin felt stifled. It leaves your skin looking shiny in an oily way. This might work for someone with dry skin, but combination and oilier, no.",2,3,B00F97FHAW
I have been using this product for years and cannot recommend it enough. I have sensitive skin and this is one of very few affordable moisturizers I have found that have SPF and don't bother my skin. One bottle will last me several months. Not oily or heavy but keeps my combo skin hydrated.,5,9,B00F97FHAW
"Long story short is-- this particular one has sunscreen in it. So you cannot put it on your forehead and sweat because it gets in your eyes and stings. Also, it's not recommended, by me, to put too close to your eyes because of the sunscreen.
It is wonderful for sensitive skin, amazingly even with the sunscreen, BUT it doesn't moisturizer very well at all. As in... your skin is moist and soft for a little while AFTER the application but does not stay that way. I don't recommend it but I can see where it could work for some. Cerave has a good line of products, just not really for me.",3,3,B00F97FHAW
"This formula rolls up when I try to run it in! If I don't rub it in, it leaves the classic zinc-sunscreen white residue. When I tried cutting it with a lighter moisturizer, still felt greasy for my dry/combo skin. On the up side, it was non-irritating, effective sunscreen and didn't clog my pores.",3,7,B00F97FHAW
Product is not absorbed by my face easily. Seems to lay on top of the skin and can see the white cream even after smoothing it in for some time. Does not leave my face feeling moisturized and within a few hours of using skin feels very dry and tight. This may be from the sunscreen it contains. My skin seems to react better to skin care products without sunscreen.,2,9,B00F97FHAW
"I've used several more expensive products for my face (like Olay and Clinique) but nothing has been more moisturizing and light as this moisturizer! I don't have the most sensitive skin, but it can break out big time if I'm not careful. This moisturizer does wonders for my combination oily skin and uneven skin tone with hyperpigmentation from acne scarring. The best part is that it's super affordable and amazing value! I'm also super lazy, so I love love love that there's a good amount of sunscreen in the product. (And not like the baby-dose 15 SPF which does absolutely nothing for your skin.) Definitely recommend this product!!",5,2,B00F97FHAW
"I usually use EltaMD Sunscreen for my face and I love it but it's a bit expensive so I thought I'd try CeraVe as my dermatologist told me this was a great brand for lotions and had peptides, etc., and I'm so glad I did. It absorbs quickly and doesn't affect or bother my makeup application or look white-ish or weird. I can use it without makeup too and it looks great. Very effective for blocking the sun, as a runner I am out in the sun quite a bit and it's been protecting my skin very well. I love it and it's half the cost of EltaMD and I think a little larger size too!",5,One,B00F97FHAW
"This was recommended to me by my dermatologist, so I bought both this and the Cerave PM moisturizer. This sunscreen/moisturizer combo is simply not hydrating enough for dry skin, I had to add additional serums to make up for it. In addition, it leaves a white cast (not a very significant one but still). It's also pretty awful under makeup because it pills. My face always looks patchy when I apply my concealer/foundation over it, which doesn't happen when I used any other moisturizer.

If your skin is combo/oily, and you're not wearing a good amount of makeup day-to-day, this is an okay option. Those with dry skin, pass on this. However, the Cerave PM is quite nice and hydrating!",2,2,B00F97FHAW
"MANY years ago, a dermatologist recommended this brand and this product, and told me to stop wasting money on expensive moisturizers. I got hooked on the entire line of CereVe products after that, and have used them for more than a decade. They are all fragrance free, and all packages contain a lot of product. I always have extras on hand. Never want to run out. This one is nice because it's not greasy at all, but has great sun protection. Definitely recommend. I always thought high end (i.e. expensive) skin care was better and a must as we age, but this product renders my prior thoughts incorrect.",5,One,B00F97FHAW
Does not absorb. Comes off in white flakes. This cannot be used as a daily moisturizer. I could not apply makeup over this because it was flaking off my skin. It smells terrible as well.,1,3,B00F97FHAW
"OH IT STINGS YOUR EYES! It just won’t soak in to the skin on my face yet somehow it still managed to slide down into my eyes, despite meticulous placement. It won’t come out despite hot water flush and skin wipes. Should I splash soap in there- will it help? Oh geez it’s been hours and my eyes still burn!! Never Again",1,4,B00F97FHAW
I'm glad I didn't read the reviews because I might have second guessed the product. I've been using it for almost a year now and bought a second bottle. It's the perfect moisturizer that's also hydrating. In the winter I use another thicker moisturizer underneath it but in the summer this with a serum under it is great. I've heard it pills with makeup but I don't really wear foundation and if I do I use a cream one. This doesn't make me break out at all or irritate my skin. I haven't found another affordable one that performs this well. It's not luxury but my skin loves it.,5,2,B00F97FHAW
"I really like this stuff. It's affordable and moisturizes my skin while also protecting me from the sun. It's great for days when I'll be outside but not for extended periods of time (otherwise I would apply another sunscreen). It doesn't seem to clog my pores and I have been using it for at least 6 months. I tend to use 4 pumps and apply all over my face and neck. I have medium/tan skin and it does not leave a white cast once it dries. Highly recommend, especially for the price. I will try their night moisturizer as well soon!",5,2,B00F97FHAW
"This product goes on light weight and does not leave you shiny. I was disappointed that the top was turned open and no seal on cap, so I wondered if product had been tampered with and unsafe or contaminated. The box it came in was smashed open inside my Amazon envelope so not sure if transport caused it to twist open or other!",3,3,B00F97FHAW
"As always, this company’s product is worth the money. Even on a cold windy day, it protects from wind burn. I usually put Vaseline on my cheeks when skiing, but this stuff does the trick and is way lighter on the skin. Their formula isn’t greasy or heavy whatsoever. It feels as if I am not wearing anything. Also, my usually shiny face is more matte even after 7 hours compared to when I don’t wear it. It doesn’t say anything about mattifying on the label, but it seems to also have that effect for me!",5,2,B00F97FHAW
"This stuff is horrible. It smells like and goes on like thick, old fashioned sunscreen and does not ever soak in completely, leaving a flaky film on your face that flakes on to your shirt like dandruff. It is nothing like you would expect a face cream to feel like and should just be marketed as sunscreen. It isn’t even that moisturizing as face creams go. I have used it for a couple days just to give it a try, but it is still pretty horrible. Don’t waste your money.",1,One,B00F97FHAW
"This product has all the right sunscreen (mineral-based)and all the best moisturizes (ceramides)fo your skin. Yes, it leaves a white cast, because it's made from minerals, not the less effective and more dangerous chemical sunscreens (that end up in your bloodstream too). Not suitable for oily skin, but perfect for sensitive to dry. Love this and recommend to all.",5,2,B00F97FHAW
"Cerave is a phenomenal brand that just SHINES in the eyes of dermatologists and consumers alike. And they did it again - they surprised me with how much moisture I can get out of a product that also offers a sun protection factor of 30. I think the only complaint I have is that it leaves your face EXTREMELY shiny, but that’s an easy fix with some oil absorbing sheets or even a very gentle pat here and there with a soft paper towel.",5,3,B00F97FHAW
Necesitaba una crema hidratante y algo que me protegiera del sol al mismo tiempo... eleji esto por el precio y las buenas reseñas .. si deja un poco de grasita en la cara pero nada que se vea mal .si usas maquillaje con eso puede arreglarlo no tuve irritación apesar de piel sensible ...es un precio justo la botella es mas pequeña de lo que esperaba pero contando que traer proteccion solar creo que es justo,5,One,B00F97FHAW
"I normally wouldn’t write reviews for a lotion specially one with so many goood reviews and me giving it a bad one but this one really ain’t it. I’ll be honest this is my first face lotion, I normally use my Lubriderm body lotion for my face as well but I decided it was time to start taking special care of my face so I decided to buy this lotion since so many great reviews, came out in a couple magazine articles plus it has SPF already. Got here Wednesday, put it on Thursday..skin broke out a bit I thought hmmm..plus a few dry spots which I purposely put more lotion there were even more visible. Okay put in on again, pores are now more visible which I’ve never had an issue with my pores. It’s Tuesday and I have a huge innie pimple on my chin which I’ve rarely ever gotten. Im givin up on my this bottle, I wanted to love it but didn’t work for me.",2,0,B00F97FHAW
"During the quarantine I have tried to focus a little more on improving my skincare routine which is why I began incorporating sunscreen to my daily routine. I was drawn to this product because its a 2-in-one moisturizer and sunscreen which allowed me to minimize the amount of products I would need to layer on my face.
The pros of this product are that it is a reasonable price, is moisturizing on my dry skin, has a reasonable SPF level (SPF 30) and leaves practically no white cast. It also works very well under makeup.
The con however, is that this product is a bit tricky to layer. I apply a vitamin C serum to my face before applying this product. When it comes time to apply this product if I don’t act quickly it begins to clump up as I rub it on my face. I do not notice this clumping effect when I use it by itself or if I quickly apply it and don’t give the product any time to dry on my face (clumping starts after about 30 secs of applying it if I go back and add more). This is something to take into consideration if you layer several oils or serums before applying your moisturizer.
I would also like to add that I have not noticed any breakouts or skin reactions when using this product. My skin is a bit on the dry side but it is generally not sensitive to products.
Overall this product gets a 4/5 because the pros outweigh the cons but that clumping effect is a bit annoying.",4,0,B00F97FHAW
"😫 I was really sad this didn’t work but especially because it made me get really bad rash or acne on my checks and forehead mid area
I usually don’t break out so I was shocked. This actually dried my skin out even more! So odd. Just wanna share my experience",1,4,B00F97FHAW
"For being an spf 30 , this is a great and easy to use sunscreen. It's moisturizing and not greasy/sunscreen feeling at all. I often use it on my neck and arms as well. It's well worth the money and protects from the sun as well as any spf 30 without aggravating my acne or giving me an allergic rash. I am allergic to a lot of personal care items so I have to use them with caution. I am so glad I found this one. I recently bought the spf 50 body version, and it is a lot heavier than this particular face cream, so keep that in mind if you try the newer body 50.",5,One,B00F97FHAW
"Caused redness under my eye and a lot of puffiness and tender feeling skin.
Felt great when I put it on up until some hours later my eyes got super puffy and skin everywhere was red and irritated. I removed immediately and applied my old product I hope the irritation goes away. I got it looking for something more moisturizing but my old product will have to do.",2,One,B00F97FHAW
"Unfortunately this product is a fake! And shouldn't be on Amazon.
The one on the right is original and smells good. The one on the left is the one l got here, it smells like chemical and gave me rashes on my face",1,4,B00F97FHAW
"I usually apply this on my face while it's still wet from me washing it. I've seen other reviews complain that this moisturizer leaves a leaves a residue and didn't really notice until one day I applied this on my face when it was dry. There is definitely a white cast with gross residue if you don't apply this on wet skin. This moisturizer works fine, just make sure it's applied to wet skin since that's when it works its best just like any other moisturizer. There are chemical filters and niacinamide in here so there might be some stinging for people with sensitive skin.",4,3,B00F97FHAW
"I have been using a PM lotion with great results. Decided to try the AM kind. I don't like it. It's white, thick and greasy. Feels heavier on the skin than the PM. Maybe because of the added sunblock? I regret spending the money on this and will continue using the PM lotion.",2,7,B00F97FHAW
"I give this Cerave moisturizer an average rating because of its beneficial ceramides and sun protection. One star was deducted because it is so thick I've had to unscrew the top and remove the nozzle in order to use it. Perhaps it is broken but it doesn't appear to be. The second star was left off because it does not play well with (some) serums, primers, foundation or other moisturizers. Pulling can occur and I've had it turn into a white film that is hard to blend. On its own, so long as it is the only moisturizer, it is good. I do wish it had a higher SPF.",3,One,B00F97FHAW
"I've been looking around for a facial moisturizer that contains SPF. Usually the product will either smell like sunscreen the entire time you wear it, or it's too oily and greasy for me to justify wearing it every day. I've been a huge fan of Cera Ve products for a long time, so it was a no brainer for me to try out their facial moisturizer. This product has been GREAT! It's incredibly light and non-oily. When you rub it in, it doesn't even feel like it's there. Highly recommend if you're looking for a lightweight moisturizer that contains SPF. I'll continue to purchase this product.",5,One,B00F97FHAW
"I use the CeraVe facial moisturizer, so was intrigued to see a sunscreen from my trusted brand. Its consistency is just a little greasier in the hand than the my daily lotion, but once its applied, it's not greasy feeling or looking at all. It protects well. My only gripe is the bottle was only half full. I had to tamp it down to get any out on just the third use.",4,2,B00F97FHAW
"My skin is really clear. I don’t ever break out and my previous moisturizers have left my face looking clear, healthy, and safe from the sun. I decided to try this one since it had good reviews but the cream leaves my face feeling drier and there’s a flaky residue. I’ve started to break out on my cheeks and I’m not happy about it.",1,5,B00F97FHAW
"I have fairly dry, sensitive skin, and my doctor turned me on to this line. I've been using this product for about two years, and I still love it. Even with my darker skin, I don't ever see a residue, and it absorbs pretty quickly. My only complaint is that it's not SPF 50, which is what my doctor recommends these days.",5,One,B00F97FHAW
"Update: After having this on my face for 1 day, got 5 new pimples the next day. Not sure how this is for sensitive skin but I've used other Cerave products and never had this type of reaction.

Disappointed in this Cerave product, expected better. Feels greasy and leaves pilling/flaky product. When trying to rub it in it pulls on the skin and creates balls of buildup. How can you put makeup over that? It also took 4 pumps to cover my face and neck, way too much! They missed the mark on this moisturizer.",1,0,B00F97FHAW
I love all the other CerVe products I'v tried but this lotion tends to be heavy and pill up on my face instead of absorbing. Takes a little extra time to rub the pills off my face but I still use it because I want the benefit of ceramides in my SPF. There is no other equivalent on the market.,3,8,B00F97FHAW
"There's no scent in this moisturizer, which I am fond of. I was told I have hyperpigmentation and sunscreen is needed if I'm out in the sun, I also have cystic acne, so I use the acne foaming wash from this brand as well. They both pair very well with each other, and it doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy or extra oily at all. I recommend this brand to anyone dealing with acne or even dry spots. I put a dab on my boyfriend's cheeks because he dries out there, and after one use it was visibly different. Highly recommend",5,0,B00F97FHAW
"Awful! It isn't moisturizing, and it rubs off immediately into little white blobs! As you can see in the picture. I had just applied this to clean skin, and this happened. It's greasy, heavy feeling too, in addition to peeling/rubbing off. 13 dollars for this tiny amount, and it is this terrible quality? Save your money and time!",1,One,B00F97FHAW
I’m pretty disappointed in this as a moisturizer. It’s advertised as a moisturizer with spf but it really feels more like just a pure sunscreen than a good moisturizer. It’s incredibly greasy and never seems to soak in which makes it uncomfortable to wear throughout the day. It doesn’t leave my skin with that soft feeling you expect from a moisturizer. Just too greasy. After a couple days I don’t think I can keep using it :(,2,One,B00F97FHAW
"This is the first sunblock I've ever found that I don't mind putting on my face. It isn't greasy and doesn't leave a nasty residue like most sunblock I've tried. It never runs into my eyes when I sweat. It's also a nice moisturizer. I actually use this after I shave, and it works a lot better than aftershave. It's really nice, and I got the PM stuff to use at night too. It does seem overpriced for what it is, but a little bit does go a long way, so hopefully it will last awhile.",5,0,B00F97FHAW
"I normally really enjoy using Cerave in my skincare routine. This product itself did it's job as a moisturizer and sunscreen. However, it had a tendency to pill on the skin :( I'm not sure if this happens to everyone but I like to put on their Vitamin C serum formula before moisturizing so I wouldn't know if it pills on a completely bare face as well!",3,One,B00F97FHAW
"I have light, naturally oily skin so I'm pretty picky with moisturizers just to be completely honest here.

The product itself applies like sunscreen: a white cream that you have to rub in and feels oily to the skin. If you compare it to facial sunscreen it's not bad, but I'm not looking for that (and there are cheaper alternatives) I'm looking for a non-greasy moisturizer.

I absolutely LOVE Cerave's ultra light moisturizer however.",2,One,B00F97FHAW
I found this to be heavy and not wanting to use it except for evening just before bed.. It is overpriced. after applying it leaves an unattractive glow finish to your face---------it might work for different skin types but I personally did not care for the product. It might be a good hand lotion.,2,4,B00F97FHAW
"I am using the facial wash, day cream and night cream. I bought this because it had very good reviews and to replace my Meaningful Beauty products. I have not been disappointed. I had no changes in my skin conditions when I switched ; no new blemishes, skin tone remains even, no oiliness or dryness. Very economical. My only objection with this day cream is it needs to be rubbed in a good bit or you can get a white tinge on your skin; i thinks its because f the SPF.",5,0,B00F97FHAW
"I wanted a product that I could use as a daily moisturizer with SPF for days I don't feel like wearing makeup. I have rosacea and this one is the first I've tried that didn't burn my eyes from the fumes being too strong. The only thing I hated was it left my face SUPER white. I felt like one of those old school lifeguards with a white nose, except it was my entire face. I'm sure it would be great under my makeup, but I wanted a product that would not turn me whiter than I already am.",2,0,B00F97FHAW
"I HATE this moisturizer. Every time I used it for a week it never absorbed and balled up and came off, I tried to wipe it off before applying make up and the rest of it just came off as applying my cream make up. It’s like a nasty sunscreen. I couldn’t figure out what was going on and came to read reviews and questions on here and see I’m having the same experience as many. Not even saving for below the chin, this moisturizer is more of a gross pain than any potential benefit.",1,0,B00F97FHAW
"I have to mix this product with other moisturizer in order to EVER apply it which is a big disappointment. Oh well, live and learn.",2,2,B00F97FHAW
"IMO, this product is more like a sunscreen than a lotion. This product is difficult to rub in and often leaves a dry, flaky residue. It is because of this issue that I use it as little as possible, obvi unhappy with the purchase. I can’t comment on whether or not it is a good moisturizer as I use it so little and my skin doesn’t feel any different. But I do have sensitive skin and I haven’t noticed any breakouts or itchiness since use. For now, I’ll stick with Cetaphil or find another product.",3,2,B00F97FHAW
I usually always go for Cera Ve Skin care products as my go to because I have very sensitive and dry skin. So I decided to try this moisturizing lotion for the SPF protection. I always apply this with the Cera Ve retinol serum before and then I apply the SPF lotion on my face but unfortunately it leaves flakes all over my skin. It makes very hard to apply makeup after when the flakes get all over my hair and face/neck area. For this reason I had to give this product 3 stars..,3,One,B00F97FHAW
"I did not like the white cast this left. I'm not sure how to describe this but it never seemed to absorb into my skin. I could rub my face or neck hours later and I would have little pieces of product on my skin. I think I've read other reviews that mentioned pilling so I think that's what I experienced. I don't like wearing makeup every day but when I wore makeup it would cover the white cast. However the pilling still occurred. Otherwise, it seems to moisturize okay which is why I gave it 3 stars.",3,One,B00F97FHAW
"love that this moisturizer has niacinamide and HA along with the classic ceramides, but the chemical UV filters in here (like most American/Western products) still make me smell like I’m going to the beach instead of just trying to protect my skin on an everyday basis :( I’m happy it doesn’t have added artificial (or natural!) fragrance ingredients to mask it, but the scent is still too strong to wear comfortably if you’re sensitive to smells.",3,One,B00F97FHAW
"No me gustó el producto. Te deja la cara muy grasosa, y al momento de secarse; te deja unos rollitos blancos cuando pasas tu mano para retocar el maquillaje o ponerte más protector.",2,2,B00F97FHAW
"This product will NOT rub into my skin! It stays on the surface for at least 2 minutes while I rub and rub it onto my face. It clumps and slides across the surface, but doesn't disappear for a very long time. After about 5 min, it finally goes into my skin, but it looks like I'm wearing ""white face"". For the size and function of this product, $13.00 is way too much. I wonder if it's old?",1,3,B00F97FHAW
"Great sunblock. However I wanted the day time night time set which I bought and this am facial lotion is not very moisturizing. Its white and cakes. Doesn't blend well. Which for sunblock is fine. As a daily moisturizer not so much. I also have very sensitive skin and it burns after gently exfoliating my face.

The pm facial moisturizer works much better and if using it before make up it almost acts as a moisturizing primer.",2,0,B00F97FHAW
"The product arrived quickly and intact. However, when I went to use it thinking that it would be creamy smooth, it came out clumpy and non dissolved so I ended up looking like a mime. Shaking did not help, nor did swirling a plastic stick into it in an attempt to emulsify it. I like Cerave moisturizers, but this was very disappointing.",1,2,B00F97FHAW
"It's moisturizing for my mature, dryish skin. But it doesn't blend in well, stays patchy.... guess it just doesn't play well with my other skincare. So I'm using it on places like back of the neck, shoulders, etc, so it doesn't go to waste, but won't repurchase.",4,One,B00F97FHAW
"I bought this when I saw it recommended by a dermatologist, and woke up with burning hives all over my face and neck. Now that I'm reading the reviews, I realize that it's not an uncommon reaction. I don't have sensitive skin and don't usually have a problem trying out new products, so this was a surprise. Sad bc it's a good price and has sunscreen - ended up giving it to my boyfriend who tried it and had no adverse reaction.",1,0,B00F97FHAW
"I liked that it has sun protection; but it just feels like I'm putting sunblock on my face--it feels thick and oily, and smells like sunblock too. Towards the middle of my day, I need to wash my face due to its oiliness (a problem I didn't have before). My dermatologist suggested trying their ""PM"" version; but that defeats the purpose of the AM version with sunscreen.",3,One,B00F97FHAW
I gave this product a 5 because it has enough moisture for dry skin. I suffer from dermatitis which has severely flared up since moving to a very humid area. This product has not irritated my skin. It goes on smoothly. I will definitely buy again. It’s advertised for oily skin but feel it’s more for dry skin.,5,2,B00F97FHAW
"I wanted to start using sunscreen daily as I know it's pretty important for skin health, but wanted a sensitive skin friendly option since most sunscreens are not meant for faces, and especially not for sensitive faces. The moisturizer worked fine except that it did leave a kind of noticeable white tint and was a strange texture even after massaging it in really well. I gave up on this sunscreen and switched to the Daily Moisturizer.",2,0,B00F97FHAW
"This stuff is great. I love the fact it uses zinc oxide for a sunscreen. I don't mind that I have to work it in until the white coloration is gone. It moisturizes well, just like CeraVe's excellent regular moisturizing cream. The only thing I don't like is the pump. Easy to use but leaves a lot of product in the bottle which you can't pump out--like 0.5oz!!!",5,One,B00F97FHAW
"I have heard great things about cerave products, and decided to try this moisturizer. It is truly awful. It sits on top of your face and doesn’t absorb in. So when you try to put makeup on over the top, the makeup also can’t absorb. If you wipe touch your face at all it wipes off in little balls. Imagine the embarrassment after you have got ready for the day and go out, only to look in the mirror and see places that your foundation have been completely wiped away. I had the PM moisturizer in my cart and I’m glad i decided to remove it. I won’t be using this brand again.",1,2,B00F97FHAW
"This moisturizer is thick, pasty even and does not blend into African American skin. It leaves a highly noticeable white layer that sits on top of the skin. This maybe ideal for sun protection however it is not appropriate for daily wear while going out in the public. This product isn’t designed for those with darker skin tones in my opinion. I will not purchase this again.",1,2,B00F97FHAW
"Used the old formula for a long time - great, absorbed no white cast issues - it also came in a tube like package. Purchased again as usual and received this new formula in the plastic oval packaging - TERRIBLE! Product seems to separate on the face and white stuff stays on your skin; you have to rub forever just to get it to go away. Extra shiny finish. So disappointed - looking for alternate product. Returning this.",1,0,B00F97FHAW
I have extremely sensitive combo skin and was super excited after reading about all the hype. I have really bad reactions to chemical sunscreens (my skin burns and stings and peels) and wasn’t aware that this was a combo sunscreen and not fully physical. This was my fault but I’m sharing this as a warning for people who may have experienced the same thing. This made the skin around my chin and jaw really rough and bumpy. It took a week for it to clear. Still looking for a sunscreen :(,1,4,B00F97FHAW
"For many years, I didn’t bother looking into using a proper facial moisturizer with SPF. But when I suffered a really bad acne breakout, my dermatologist recommended I start using one along with prescription ointment.

I’m soooo happy that I have found this! It works great. I have purchased it through Amazon and got great products (I see a lot of negative reviews). The trick to this moisturizer is using a tiny drop. It’s enough to cover your entire face and neck without the left over residue. I have not have a problem with new breakouts with the use of this and I tend to have oily skin!!",5,One,B00F97FHAW
"I bought this as a facial moisturizer, but never got to find out about that. After one use, my face had red blotches all over. Another reviewer reported the same problem. However, my face is not that sensitive, so I gave it a try. Throwaway item for me.",1,One,B00F97FHAW
"I'm terrible and put off wearing a facial sunscreen for years because I hated either the oilyness/white-cast or breakouts from wearing sunscreen, but this makes me look forward to wearing sunscreen on my face now. It has a unique kinda makeup primer consistency. This smells like sunscreen, but I think it smells good *shrugs*. It's never broken me out but my skin is more even and happy now. I also have more peace of mind knowing I'm protected daily in the strong California sun.",5,0,B00F97FHAW
"This is my 4th or 5th time purchasing this lotion. It isn't greasy and doesn't leave too much of a white tint on my skin (I'm African American- and on the darker side) like many moisturizers do, due to the sunscreen. It keeps my skin moisturized throughout the day really well and hasn't irritated my sensitive skin thus far. Will continue to purchase as it was a little cheaper on Amazon than at Walmart/Target.",4,0,B00F97FHAW
"I wanted to love this. It’s a great brand with great ingredients, but this product fell very short. It doesn’t feel moisturizing at all, after about 4 days of use my skin feels tight and dry. It is very thick and pills up in white beads and smears as you put it on. Very much like a sunscreen, not a daily moisturizer. It doesn’t bother my sensitive skin, so I’ll keep it as a facial sunscreen. Certainly can’t be used as a daily moisturizer though.",1,2,B00F97FHAW
"I’ve used this for almost 2 months and I am completely satisfied. THIS PRODUCT SHOULD BE THE LAST STEP TO YOUR MORNING SKIN CARE ROUTINE. It does it’s job and my face feel moisturized after it’s applied. I usually add it last to my skin care routine in the morning, right before I do my make up and so far nothing to complain about. This is also found at walmart, and my derma recommended it to me because of my sensitive skin.",5,0,B00F97FHAW
"I bought this as a daily moisturizer to apply under my makeup. It has awesome skincare ingredients which is what drew me to this product. However, this product does not blend into my skin. It will leave white streaks and the more I try to run it into my skin it will ball up. The past few times I’ve tried using this, I’ve had to wash my face and completely start over.",2,One,B00F97FHAW
"I can’t use this lotion because it peels off after it dries. Even if I don’t wear it under make up, it peels off in white beads.

It also stings my eyes when I workout.",1,7,B00F97FHAW
"It has taken me years to find a daily facial SPF or moisturizer with SPF that doesn't make me break out, even though they all claim that they will not cause breakouts. This one has not caused any breakouts, it's not greasy either, but it still feels very moisturizing. I do wish they would create another version with SPF 50, but I am so happy to have finally found one that works so well. It does have a slight sunscreen scent, but it does contain sunscreen! It does dissipate within a minute or two though. If you have oily skin and/or acne, this one's for you!",5,One,B00F97FHAW
"Application is extremely difficult. The thick texture prevent you to rub it in evenly, resulting in an uneven white cast. I personally don’t mind a mild white cast if it is even, but this product dries down into white patches and makes me look ridiculous. In addition, the thick textual also makes it more prone to balling up and pilling. I believe most people are buying spf moisturizers because they don’t want the hassle of applying subscreen in the morning. However, this product is just going to make your morning even messier.",2,2,B00F97FHAW
I like it. It is for sure a dupe for the La Roche-Posay one also the same feel but once I spray my Rose water mist this one just gets funky on my skin. It coagulates and I will get little while pieces on my face which means it doesn't mix well with whatever is in the rose water. So I then am not able to use it. So I alternative between them. I bought this one because I use the PM one and love it. This one is thick but I will say it doesn't leave a white cast on your face just rub it in well to get it warm and it will bland well.,4,0,B00F97FHAW
Love this sunscreen. I am on my 4th product. This actually cleared my skin and improved my complexion. I am not sure why but it did help may be cause of the less chemicals used in this.,5,3,B00F97FHAW
"Okay so I love this cream. The reason for the docked review is because apparently since it’s a “moisturizer” I was reading from another party that it gives significantly less protection from the sun...I bought it solely because I love cerave products and needed an everyday sunblock so this seemed perfect. I guess I’m going to do more research but yeah the moisturizer and everything about it is great it’s just that I read elsewhere that you’ll need another everyday sunblock with it, which defeats the whole purpose for me.",3,0,B00F97FHAW
This product barely absorbed into my skin. It is not moisturizing at all. It’s basically just a mineral sunscreen which leaves a white cast on my face. I’m guessing it probably provides sun protection but don’t buy if you are looking for moisturizing properties.,1,2,B00F97FHAW
So first off I wanna say I LOVE Cerave skin care products.. heard SO many good things about this one from dermatologists I follow.. so I really wanted to love this one but it leaves a white residue that pills up and looks like your skin is peeling!! Looks HORRIBLE! Forget about getting makeup on over it! Tried this multiple times just running errands and had to wash it off it looked so bad and clumpy. Stay away from this one.,1,0,B00F97FHAW
"I received this product on October 16 of 2019 and the sell by date on the box is 3/20 so the product is obviously quite old. The pump top also doesn't work. Amazon is replacing. Hopefully the replacement will be more acceptable.

I should add that I've been using this product and the product itself is excellent. I just have to be careful as to where I purchase it going forward.",1,One,B00F97FHAW
"I gave this a 4 because it is rather thick and if you want to make up on over it, I found it to make putting on foundation a little clumpy. If you let it soak in for a few minutes and then apply the makeup it is much better.",4,One,B00F97FHAW
"Love this. Saves me an extra step in the morning by combining moisturizer and lotion. Even my man uses it in the AM because its hassle free.....now if only they made one with a tiny bit of foundation to tint the skin then it would be amazing but I honestly cant complain
This is my 3rd bottle. I like the push application. Saves me time and protects my skin, cant complain",5,0,B00F97FHAW
"I normally use this brand for moisturizer, but this is the first time trying the AM lotion. I do like it, but the price is high compared to the regular moisturizer. This bottle is a lot smaller. So far sun protection has been fine, I wish the SPF was a bit higher. I have sensitive skin and this irritates the skin under my eyes and makes them water. Not terribly, but it’s uncomfortable for a couple minutes. I plan to ask my dermatologist for a different option.",3,0,B00F97FHAW
Applied this in the AM without anything else and while its ok (slightly greasy) it would slightly pill on my face (this occurred for my friend too - worst for her though than me ). I love cerave and love the PM lightweight moisturizer but this particular product did not work for my skin. I have seen other people in the reviews have an issue with this so I would just prepare that this might happen to you.,1,One,B00F97FHAW
"I had high hopes for this sunscreen because I love Cerave! However, as many other reviewers stated, it doesn't
' sink in and peels off the skin just minutes after applying. It even caused a rash on my cheeks. It also leaves a white cast on my skin, and not evenly. So, I had white spots all over my face, white peels, and just looked weird. I will use it for my hands only",2,0,B00F97FHAW
"I wanted to like this product so much, but unfortunately it became a disappointment for me.
First, it leaves white stains on your skin and it's very hard to blend it.
Second thing is that by the evening I had whiteheads all over my face. As my skin is sensitive, I wouldn't recommend it to people with the same type of skin.
The good thing about it is moisturizing.",2,0,B00F97FHAW
"this is a terrible product. does not moisturize your skin, and leaves white residue behind. it’s really sticky and gross. when you apply it and rub it in white balls start forming and its not an appealing look. it is very thick and one squirt barley covers your nose. a waste of money",1,One,B00F97FHAW
LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!! I use it every morning because you can always use the protection. It’s very moisturizing and it does protect me from the sun. I also bring this to the beach and reapply after I go into the water. I have pretty dry skin & this is great start to my morning,5,2,B00F97FHAW
"Never used a moisturizer with spf in it and didnt know it caused aging and other problems. Once I started using this in combination with my other face products i noticed a difference. My face had a more natural glow and shine, scarring went away but that might've been from the other products. Only negative is that if you sweat with this holy balls your face gets greasy.",5,2,B00F97FHAW
"I've never had a problem with CeraVe products before but this was just beyond disappointing. It left a whitish residue on my face afterward and took forever absorb into my skin. When I looked at myself in a mirror in public it was visible which parts of my face had absorbed it and which didn't because part of my face was visibly lighter than the other. (My skin tone is light brown). Would not recommend. However, the CeraVe ""PM"" version of this product (without the SPF) is a lot lighter and works much better. If SPF is not a strong consideration for you, I'd recommend that one. If SPF is a priority, do not buy this product.",2,One,B00F97FHAW
i use this as part of my skin care routine because i use a rather harsh face mask once a week that makes my skin very sensitive. it’s the perfect balance of moisturizer and spf,5,3,B00F97FHAW
"I love the PM version and use it daily, but I'm not a fan of this. Very chalky, moderately bad white cast, and I feel like it just sits on the skin for a long time. Using the amount necessary to actually get the SPF coverage feels gross. I'm using mine up by using small amounts thinned with a hyluronic acid toner or a few drops of squalane oil and also using a separate sunscreen. In the future I'll stick to the PM formulation.",3,One,B00F97FHAW
This is a good product for morning use but it doesn’t keep my skin moisturized all day. It feels dry again a couple of hours later. After using Neutrogena Hydroboost I have to say this product just doesn’t compare. My face felt dewy all day even through the night with Neutrogena. I gave it a shot but it’s just not for me. If you have dry skin you may want to pass on this one.,4,0,B00F97FHAW
"I love the Cerave tub so much I decided to try this out. I needed a good spf during the day. I love how moisturizing this is, especially now in the winter when my skin gets extra dry and sensitive. It is a pretty versatile lotion as I can also use it during hot weather when my skin can become combo/oily and dry in some areas. I am very pleased with this product!",5,0,B00F97FHAW
"This product was recommended to me by a dermatologist to treat my rosacea. I have been using it for a few years now and the results are incredible. I rarely have flair-ups... pretty much only when I go out in the sun and forget to apply the Cerave.

PROS:
- Very effective for rosacea
- Unscented
- Lightweight
- Non-greasy
- Good value - a bottle can last months for me",5,One,B00F97FHAW
This is not that great of a product. It barely sinks into the skin without aggressive rubbing in and end up pilling up and literally balls up and flakes off. It’s not very moisturizing either so I have to end up using another moisturizer in conjunction with this product which defeats the purpose for me. I’d rather buy a different because because this doesn’t work well with other products.,2,One,B00F97FHAW
"The moisturizer works well and is great against UV rays. The only con I have is that, as someone with darker skin, it leaves a white cast, but It will go away if you rub it in enough. It also leaves a shine, which is great if that is what you want.",4,One,B00F97FHAW
"The Ultra-light was out of stock so I’ve decided to go with this product. BIG mistake! If you’re planning on using this as a daily face moisturizer I would not recommend. I don’t use makeup yet, it leaves a flaky white film on your face. The consistency is the worst of all face creams I have tried.",1,One,B00F97FHAW
"This product is kind of thick because it’s mineral sunscreen. I was hoping it would be a little smoother because it’s cerave, but it still has that “hard to rub in” feel to it. It also leaves a SLIGHT white cast if you have a tan. I do Like that it has a pump. I don’t know if I would purchase again... I like my moisturizers to go on a little easier.",3,0,B00F97FHAW
"I am normal to dry skin, I love how moisturized it leaves my skin with out drying it out even when I sweat, there is no sticky feeling. When applied (and since it is the last product I apply) I have noticed it flakes, maybe it’s just me, maybe it’s other products I use before, I’m no pro so I just gently dab it in now with my hands and it seems to help.",5,0,B00F97FHAW
"Good 2 in 1 combo - sunscreen & moisturizer.
Only SPF 30, Zinc oxide 6.3%. Need 2x. to 3x applications. Affordable & not bulky container fits perfect inside my purse...can carry around all day.",5,One,B00F97FHAW
"I will return this. When the product info said ""InVisibleZinc Technology"" I thought it was a mineral sunscreen, but it also has Homosalate (and other chemicals) which is something I don't want to absorb into my skin on a daily basis. I learned my lesson to be ever vigilant reading ingredients. I trusted the CeraVe brand when I should be more careful.",1,2,B00F97FHAW
"No matter how I apply this product, it pills. It looks like I have white flakes all over my face. I have fuller brows and have to brush the white bits out of my brows. I've tried it right after washing (step 2) and as the last step in my routine (step 4), and pills every single time. I won't be repurchasing.",2,One,B00F97FHAW
"I didn't have any problems with a white residue and I do enjoy that this particular sunscreen isn't perfumed. However, I do have a terrible time with it pilling off when applying primer or foundation. I've tried waiting 15 minutes before applying anything over it, but the product sometimes even starts to pill when I'm just trying to rub it in.",2,One,B00F97FHAW
"As a dark-skinned individual, I can only use certain kinds of spf -- the ones that are completely transparent. Otherwise, the sunscreen leaves the white looking layer on my screen and it is very obvious. So, I was disappointed to find out that this product does not cater to dark-skinned individuals. Other than that, this product may be great. I just don't want to walk around looking gray.",2,One,B00F97FHAW
"I agreed with someone reviewers, this is more like sunscreen than face lotion. It is a little greasy to me and thick. Smells exactly like sunscreen. My face feels sticky when it is on. I can't use it everyday...feels too heavy any sticky. No breakouts and no sunburns using it and I have sensitive skin, but it wasn't what I expected or hoped for.",3,0,B00F97FHAW
"This moisturizer leaves a white film, peels off, doesn't absorb well. Not satisfied. Won't buy again.",1,4,B00F97FHAW
This moisturizing lotion with SPF feels more like sunscreen than lotion. My face did not feel moisturized or hydrated after using the product but felt very dry and tight. Would recommend applying another moisturizer before this one if you want to use it as sunscreen.,1,3,B00F97FHAW
"Good stuff. CeraVe Facial Moisturizing Lotion AM has all the right ingredients and, most importantly, an SPF of 30. The science (no clinical tests) is still out on ceramides and niacinamide, and hyaluronic acid won't penetrate to where it might do best, but it doesn't hurt to have them in a lotion. I've found that this formulation goes a long way: you only need a pea-sized amount for head and neck.",4,0,B00F97FHAW
"This must be an old bottle! I've used this product before from the dug store but the liquid in this bottle was too thick, it appears old!!",1,3,B00F97FHAW
"I’ve been using this consistently for a couple years now and highly recommend it. It is very moisturizing. I always put it on each morning, since it has SPF, whether it’s under my makeup or on by itself. My grandma has sensitive skin but I had her try it and she says she likes it too! Will keep buying this!",5,2,B00F97FHAW
"I wish they would take out all the SPF ingredients in this moisturizer because the white cast is terrible and you have to rub it in, which is never good. If I need SPF, I would use the Krave Beet Shield. The US really needs to catch up with the rest of the world when it comes to UV filter ingredients. BESIDE THAT, this lotion is very moisturizing and really helped my skin produce less oil. I would overlook the debacle and give this a 5 star",5,0,B00F97FHAW
"I was excited for this but Im pretty tan (black and Mexican) and bc of the sunscreen it left a pretty heavy white cast on my skin. I love the way it felt on my skin, it’s moisturizing with out over doing it.",3,One,B00F97FHAW
"I have oily skin in summer and combo skin in winter. This is a bit too heavy for me in summer. I love it for winter.
In summer I prefer the Cetaphil Dermacontrol Lotion to lightly moisturize while keeping oil under control and prevention of UV damage (I don't burn, but I want to keep my skin smooth, healthy and spot-free as I age).",4,3,B00F97FHAW
"I use CeraVe products routinely and was excited to see and try this one, but I was disappointed when I tried it. The cream is like a heavy white paste that goes on like a mask and doesn't absorb well at all. It is not a lotion and doesn't make my skin feel as nice as the regular moisturizing lotion. I'm not sure how well the sunscreen part works, but I don't like it well enough to continue using it.",2,0,B00F97FHAW
"Leaves a white cast and pills up when I tried to rub it in. Would not buy again. Mixing with a better sunscreen makes it usable enough that I won’t waste it, so I’ll get through this bottle. Did not irritate my skin, did seem moisturizing, if a little bit greasy.",2,One,B00F97FHAW
Greasy! This moisturizer made my face shiny and was so greasy even the hair around my face would look oily a few hours into the day. I tried it for a week hoping it would get better but unfortunately did not. I have normal skin so maybe this would work better on super dry skin?,2,One,B00F97FHAW
"Perfect for daytime wear for skin that requires moisturizer and sunscreen during the day. Since it's oil free, it hasn't caused any type of breakout while providing daily protection. I pair this with the night time version.",5,One,B00F97FHAW
Just listen to the other reviews! I bought this one by mistake thinking it was the another cerave daily moisturizer. It leaves a white film and sticky feeling. Yuck,2,One,B00F97FHAW
"I’ve never used a daily moisturizer before. One day I was looking at my skin with some red spots and acne and I decided to start a real skin care routine, with this moisturizer for the morning. It goes on like any other sunscreen and takes a little rubbing in and makes your face look white, but it dries nicely. The moisturizer doesn’t look shiny, and keeps my face looking matte all day, plus it gives me the benefits of sunscreen which I also have ignored for my whole life. I have normal skin and don’t react to much, but this causes no breakouts or anything, and I feel like my face looks more filled out and evenly toned.",5,0,B00F97FHAW
"It does a good job moisturizing and providing decent sun protection. I bought this because I have sensitive skin on my face and I like it, my only problem is the thickness. I usually mix it with my daily moisturizer because I don’t want to apply such a thick product to my face all day",4,One,B00F97FHAW
I bought it because of the raving reviews. I wish I could return the item. it makes my eyes water. I got huge pimple after a couple days of use. Very thick consistency and not easy to spread. I had to really go in and work hard to get rid of white caste. I highly DO NOT recommended this moisturizer/sunscreen. I'll stick to my Korean Sunscreen.,1,0,B00F97FHAW
"I’ve been looking for moisturizer for my 58 year old face and this product is great! I’ve only used it for a few days but my face is so soft; even after I use witch hazel to clean my makeup off at the days end. Goes on like sunscreen, has no smell, it’s not heavy-feeling nor greasy. Recommended to a friend of same age; she is going to try the product. Will definitely buy again AND the buy 2, get a third free is a great bonus",5,3,B00F97FHAW
"I was using a Neutrogena daily moisturizer with SPF 35 but thought I'd try this product instead since I love all other things CeraVe. Keyword is definitely ""other"" in this case. Like many of the other reviewers have said, this product definitely leaves a residue on your skin after you apply it, and if you plan on applying anything else on top (like primer, foundation, etc), it will pill even more significantly. Also, the few times I managed to apply all my makeup without trapping the nasty moisturizer globs under my foundation, I noticed my makeup wore horribly throughout the day. For context, I've been using all my other products for years, and I'm used to how they should look after 10 hours of wearing them.

So I would say if you're looking for a daily moisturizer with SPF to layer underneath primer/foundation/powder, LOOK ELSEWHERE. This product is probably work for you if you're going to be otherwise barefaced.

That being said, the CeraVe nightly moisturizer is lovely, and I do enjoy their standard moisturizing cream as well as many other products. Not trying to hate on the brand, this product just didn't work for me.",3,0,B00F97FHAW
"This product could be better. I wash my face with the Cerave facial cleanser, use witch-hazel cleanser, apply Vitamin C serum, then the facial moisturizer. After the Vitamin C, I wait a few minutes before applying the moisturizer and it seems to leave my forehead feeling amazing, but once I get to my cheeks and chin, it starts to leave residue. Then I have to wipe it off, and it's like what's the point of this if I have to take it off after. I have also tried it without the Vitamin C moisturizer, and it still does the same thing.",2,0,B00F97FHAW
"I have basically switched to all CeraVe products at this point. This is another great one. I always had a deep hate for sunscreen on my face as it makes me break out every time. This one doesn't make me break out at all, very non-greasy, and it really protects my face. I put it on every morning. There is no scent.",5,0,B00F97FHAW
"Great product! This lotion has good SPF, not greasy and absorbs into my acne prone skin. It does not cause breakouts and gives me a nice glow under makeup.",5,One,B00F97FHAW
"This leaves a film that ends up peeling and only gets worse when you try to rub it in. It leaves my face feeling dry. No amount of more or less of the product changes the results. As this was recommended by a dermatologist, I am extremely disappointed.",1,2,B00F97FHAW
I had a sample of this product from my Dermotologist and loved it. It was creamy and moisturizing. I use the PM version of this product as well. The AM product that I got from Amazon as well as from the drug store is nothing like the sample. It stays on white and feels like pure zinc oxide. I will use it at the beach and use the PM version and sunscreen instead.,2,0,B00F97FHAW
I’ve been using this for a few days it works good I don’t notice my skin getting dry which is good...... but on the bottle is says moisturizer and sunscreen and on the back of the bottle all it talks about is sun block and skin cancer prevention so yes it doesn’t dry my skin but it might be sunscreen,4,0,B00F97FHAW
I loved the Creve Pm lotion so I gave this a shot. Much disappointment the fact that it is incredibly hard to blend it into your skin. I’ve used many spf moisturizers and this has been the worse kind when it comes to absorbing. You literally have to rub it hard into your skin which is not good for your skin! White specks appear throughout the day. Would not recommend!,1,One,B00F97FHAW
"I got this sunscreen because of how hyped it is on tiktok and youtube. I would pass on this. I tried using this sunscreen alone. I tried using it on top of other products like hylarounic acid and it doesn’t blend into my skin. It’s very thick. It doesn’t make my face oily but it just does not blend. It sits on top of my skin like how a heavy, matte foundation would. And if I try to work it into my skin it starts piling. Time to search for another sunscreen after this",2,0,B00F97FHAW
"The lotion had lumps in it, even when I smoothed it between my hands. How old is this product? Should it have been sold. I don't use it.",1,2,B00F97FHAW
"This is an interesting product for me. I use it as more of just a sunscreen. I put on my regular moisturizer then this over it. It’s very white and takes a minute to really rub in...just like sunblock. You also have to put it on while your face is damp or with another product already on your face bc putting it right onto dry skin did not work well. It peeled and rolled. I have dry skin though so I’m sure that played a part. If you have oily skin try it and let me know! It is a good SPF product to have, wouldn’t fiend for it though.",4,0,B00F97FHAW
I like this stuff but it is a tad greasy. It also kinds of enhances any bumps or blemishes on your face.. like makes them way more noticeable.,5,One,B00F97FHAW
This product is so thick it's impossible to even run in your face. It feels thick and oily and leaves a white film on your skin because it's so impossible to rub in. Definitely not light. Used it twice and will not use again.,1,One,B00F97FHAW
I'm typically a big fan of this brand but I honestly hate this product. I only give it two stars because it's nice sunscreen. Don't use this for moisturizer as it doesn't work. Thick and gloopy. Hard to work into the skin. Makes my skin feel gritty and dirty.,2,One,B00F97FHAW
"This moisturizer didn't leave my skin feeling amazing like other moisturizers I've used in the past, but it's decent enough. It doesn't absorb right away, so rubbing it across your face will help. Plus, you might as well distribute it across your skin evenly.
I mainly bought this moisturizer due to the SPF rating. It definitely smells like sunscreen, but it's not overpowering and it's pretty manageable. I would recommend not using too much of it, otherwise, it may leave your face looking a little white.",4,0,B00F97FHAW
"My dermatologist recommended this lotion, so I suppose it’s a decent choice from an ingredient standpoint. It has a horrible, think and paste-like consistency, however, leaving my face feel like I ran around with a slimy film for the rest of the day. Given the residue it left on the skin, applying makeup over it wasn’t an option either. The lotion pilled and makeup became cakey - unfortunately can’t recommend this one.",2,One,B00F97FHAW
"This is a nice moisturizer, but I personally didn’t like that it made my face sticky and shiny, and I’d get white buildup and the product would flake all over me and look like I have dandruff. You absolutely cannot touch your face with this moisturizer. I recommend trying something different or using 2 separate if you want moisture and sun protection.",3,0,B00F97FHAW
This product is very thick like a regular sunscreen and smells like sunscreen. I definitely won’t be buying it again. I usually cough up the big bucks to buy Coola and will definitely be doing that in the future. This doesn’t spread well and just smells like I’m going to the pool/beach... bleh. Not an everyday morning moisturizer.,2,0,B00F97FHAW
I like the CereVe brand but if you don't let any skin care or moisturizer dry down before you apply this it will pill up quite badly. I ended up gifting it to someone else and it works great for them.,5,One,B00F97FHAW
"I was really excited to start using this product which is why returning it was not a decision I made lightly. I use their PM Moisturizer and it's worked really well for me but this one? It's texture is incredibly thick and takes awhile to work into the skin to get rid of the white streaks. And once it dries, you're left with residue that makes applying a smooth layer of foundation near impossible. The search for a great moisturizer with SPF continues...",3,0,B00F97FHAW
"Since I love the PM version of Cerave Moisturizer I thought surely I'd love the same moisturizer but with sunscreen. Well it is thicker, stickier and oilier than the PM version. I can't use it since it clogs my pores. I'm disappointed in this one but will still use the PM day and night.",2,0,B00F97FHAW
"I have super dry skin and live in vegas so its even worse than before. I’ve been using it for 2 weeks as well as all the other cerave products and it has made such a difference. I dont feel like i need to moisturize every hour. Usually any new facial products, make up, face wash, moisturizers make me break out into hives due to super dry skin but i had no reaction to this. Absolutely love this brand now.",5,One,B00F97FHAW
"Very thick, didn't absorb well, and didn't seem to moisturize. Disappointed because I was told that this is a preferred ""drugstore"" brand dermatologists. Maybe I just bought the wrong product.",1,2,B00F97FHAW
I’m pretty sure this works for a lot of you but no thanks. It’s greasy it has a smell to it and it pills. It sticks to my dry patches and overall is just awful. I use tons of actives so I need a sunscreen that can plump my skin and hydrate it as well as protect it from the sun not clumpy and shiny.,2,One,B00F97FHAW
"This is fairly lightweight. I have oily, acne prone skin, so it makes my face shine more than it may for others with dry skin. I use Retin-A, and I can definitely tell when I've forgotten to apply this in the morning.",5,One,B00F97FHAW
I absolutely love this product I even bought the p.m. facial moisturizing lotion too but I got that one from Walmart for the same price I just found it but anyway works great I can see a very big difference I usually have dry and oily skin but it has mostly cleared up in my makeup looks flawless now,5,0,B00F97FHAW
This moisturizer was recommended by my Dermatologist years ago and I have been using it continuously since then. I grew up and live in Florida and the sun can be brutal. This moisturizer includes sunscreen does the job. It is also light weight and goes on easily.,5,2,B00F97FHAW
This really protects against the sun amazingly! The only problem I had is that the product left a white finish on my face and also it did not provide a lot of moisture. I use this product for the sun protection but I have to apply it directly after using my regular facial lotion since it does not provide enough moisture alone. It is definitely a good product in preventing sun burn and sun aging but I hope CeraVe works on the formula to make it moisturizing and more of translucent finish.,4,0,B00F97FHAW
"How to say my feelings about it,I like cerave brand, but not this lotion. it is not good for me. I don’t know why the white mud will be rubbed after applying the face. I do think about may be because of it can not match my toner,but I do try 2 different toners and also try don't apply toners, the white mud still come out. I'm not have a sensitive skin,and my skin always healthy, I just want try a different facial lotion. I'm disappointed at this. Only one thing I feel good about Amazon service, I get a broken box lotion first time, the customer service sent me another one soon.",2,0,B00F97FHAW
"This lotion was recommended by my dermatologist. However, it makes my sensitive skin burn and it also cakes up and leaves dry pieces of lotion on my skin. I even tried it on my hands and it did the same thing. Huge disappointment. I'm past the return window so my money is wasted",3,0,B00F97FHAW
"I don't love the feel of this on my skin. It feels and smells very much like just straight-up sunscreen, not at all like any moisturizer I've tried. It's feels like it kind of just sits right on the surface of my skin with a slightly tacky feel. It doesn't feel like it absorbs into the skin well. I am happy to receive SPF protection and the smell is not unpleasant. However, I didn't purchase this to be my SPF, I wanted a moisturizer as I already have a separate SPF. Just doesn't feel like it's actually doing anything to help moisturize my skin.",2,One,B00F97FHAW
I’m not a fan of this moisturizer though I LOVE the PM facial moisturizer lotion. I’ve repurchased it probably 3 or 4 times now and use it morning and night. This AM moisturizer leaves a slight white cast on my face and it’s hard to get it to fully sink into your skin. It doesn’t work well with any other products whatsoever. I’ve had this moisturizer sitting on my shelf for months unused. The search for a good moisturizer with SPF continues.,2,0,B00F97FHAW
"I wanted this facial moisturizer/ sunscreen for more of an everyday use to apply before my makeup. However, i noticed my makeup did not set well on top of this product. Also, it made my face look very shiny and sticky. It is a good face sunscreen, and I would recommend for more of a beach day face screen.",3,One,B00F97FHAW
"This is really nice and light on the skin. Absorbs quickly and doesn’t leave you greasy. It does have a very light sunscreen smell but I hardly notice if after I put it on, and it’s not unpleasant. I have very oily skin and this doesn’t make me oily or greasy throughout the day.",5,0,B00F97FHAW
Love the CeraVe line! This is a light product to apply but my only issue with this is it does start to pill up and rub off. Being from Arizona I know sunscreens and they shouldn’t do that so that’s a big issue.. other than that i think it is doing what it’s supposed to!,4,0,B00F97FHAW
"I personally did not like this moisturizer — but keep reading. The consistency was very thick, and just sort of slid over my skin instead of absorbing. Instead of throwing it out, I gave it to my boyfriend and he loves it! It soaks into his skin easily (I’m guessing because he has bigger pores? Idk). He said it’s very moisturizing and he likes that it has SPF.",4,0,B00F97FHAW
"Product arrived open, out of its individual box, and the lotion was all over the packaging and other items in it too.",1,4,B00F97FHAW
So far so good...just purchased a month or so ago along with other products from the same line. My skin is looking so much better now than it ever has. I have suffered with acne since a teenager and I am now 35. Doesnt make my skin greasy and can put makeup on with no problems.,5,0,B00F97FHAW
I actually feel bad about giving this product a lower review because I do like this brand for other items but I just didn't care for this moisturizer. I think it's because of the high SPF in it that it feels sticky and heavy on my skin. I wouldn't order this again.,3,0,B00F97FHAW
"Agree with the bad reviews on this...this was peeling after I applied it. I rubbed it in and immediately the more I massaged it in...The more it would start to flake off. Also tried it on brand new washed face and did the same so it’s the product, not my skin or other serums I use before sunscreen.",1,0,B00F97FHAW
"I know products like corn flakes settle, but I didn't expect a thick face lotion to do the same. The bottle was at least 1/3 empty!",1,One,B00F97FHAW
This stuff is awful. Ya know the stuff that life guards in the cheezy movies wears on their noses? This is that stuff. Its SUPER think and SUPER greasy. I couldnt imagine wearing this as an everyday routine. I'm a huge fan of CeraVe but they really missed the target with this one.,2,0,B00F97FHAW
"The cream doesn’t moisturize at all and it doesn’t feel nice to the skin. The texture doesn’t feel nice, it takes long time to absorb",2,One,B00F97FHAW
"I've used this moisturizer for 7 years and haven't looked for another one since. Having sensitive and dry skin makes me have trust issues with many products that could potentially cause breakouts. This. One. Doesn't! My skin feels moisturized all day. I guess the only con is that it may feel oily throughout the day (4-6 hours). This may not be good for severely dry skin though. During winter, I needed two layers to cover the flakes and dry patches.",5,0,B00F97FHAW
"This was recommended by my dermatologist and I absolutely love it. It is completely fragrance free, goes on thin, does not feel sticky or greasy. I love the added bonus of sun protection. It will not make your make up slide. In the summer I use it for my hands as well. Highly recommend to any one, men or women.",5,0,B00F97FHAW
"I haven’t really been out in the sun to test the effectiveness of this yet but I was hoping I could apply this and be done with it - you know a perfect moisturizer, and although it doesn’t irritate my skin it isn’t moisturizing enough for my skin. I even applied another dose and it still isn’t enough for me. Bummer.",4,One,B00F97FHAW
"Much more of a sunscreen than a daily moisturizer. It is ok for my sensitive skin, but seems to clog my pores if I use it daily. Much more of a sunscreen texture and thickness too.",3,One,B00F97FHAW
"Totally amazed how well this moisturizer does my face. Moisturizers typically make me break out or I get super oily (like, can’t wear eye contacts oily)",5,2,B00F97FHAW
"It is an okay daily moisturizer but it is very thick and if you get it near your eyes they sting, even after it’s absorbed into the skin. I won’t be repurchasing but I’ll use the bottle.",3,One,B00F97FHAW
"Great for everyday use. Goes great as a base underneath makeup. Never leaves skin feeling oily. It does have an initial strong sunscreen scent, but it does not feel like you are wearing sunscreen. It has zinc oxide, which is ideal because that ingredient helps the sunscreen stay on, so you don’t have to worry about reapplying after sweating.",5,2,B00F97FHAW
I’m not sure why people rave about this. It’s horrible! It never completely absorbs into the skin. I’ve tried using it under my make up and it literally makes it to where I can wipe off my makeup with a swipe from my finger. I also tried using it alone with out wearing any makeup and it still didn’t work out. It just makes me feel like a giant grease ball.,1,0,B00F97FHAW
"not sure if i read reviews before i bought this product, so this is my bad. but this is just a sunscreen, you know how that is, kind of greasy, stays on the surface of the skin, makes your face feel hot when you are outside because you have this oily mask on your face.
i will use it up this summer, probably on my arms.",1,0,B00F97FHAW
This product isn’t hydrating at all. Leaves skin with a white film. Wish I could return it,1,2,B00F97FHAW
It smells much like sunscreen and leaves white overcast after applying. definitely seems moisturizing but it doesnt blend into the skin the way a sunscreen moisturizer should,3,One,B00F97FHAW

Nice product. Dermatologist recommended. Would buy again. Not heavily scented or heavy on skin. Soaks in well and does not irritate,5,One,B00F97FHAW
Al igual que la pm esta crema es súper buena solo que no exageres con pa porción no necesitas aplicar grandes cantidades del producto en el rostro lo que si es que si estás al sol sigue las indicaciones de repetir cada dos horas por lo demás todo bien,5,0,B00F97FHAW
"Its the best moisturizer ever its amazing for sensitive skin, couldn't recommend it more. My skin doesn't feel like the Sahara desert anymore, felt like I've been touched with a (lightly moist) coat of love. I could honestly probably write an entire essay on this product in MLA format, its just that good, its pretty inexpensive as well, go ahead try it out chances are you'll like it and end up just as addicted as I am.",5,0,B00F97FHAW
There’s something in this cream that my skin Is sensitive to. Used it twice both times my skinned got irritated and my face is covered with fine rash. I had great hopes for this lotion since it’s dermatology proven :/,1,2,B00F97FHAW
"I am so obsessed with this! And the fact that it has SPF in it makes it even better!!! I use it every single day without missing a beat! I honestly think it has transformed my skin from dry to very, very hydrated! I will forever be a fan of Cerave products!!",5,0,B00F97FHAW
My go to daily morning moisturizer for years. I wear it religiously and it never feels heavy on my skin. I was recommended this brand from a dermatologist and I’m so glad that I switched from other brands that I would had been using over the years.,5,One,B00F97FHAW
"This product seemed very thick when I first used it. I soon realized that it’s not a moisturizer, but a sunscreen. The directions and application suggest using 2 hours before sun exposure and that it helps with sun protection. Thinking it was a moisturizer, I used it for a couple days and saw dry rashes breaking out on the bottom of my face. Terribly advertised product.",1,2,B00F97FHAW
"I have super sensitive skin and I'm battling severe psoriasis, this lotion is amazing. A little goes a long way, if you put too much it tends to leave a little bit of white cast. Massage into skin gently but thourougly. No break outs, no redness, works really well for extremely sensitive skin",5,0,B00F97FHAW
This spf is just ok. It’s very greasy leaves my face super shiny. The white cast does go away after some rubbing. It’s a thin light weight lotion. I wouldn’t mind trying something else after this. I’m not sure I would buy again. ToO greasy! There is no odor from this.,5,0,B00F97FHAW
Purchased for my husband. He’s used this product for years and never changes.My husband has tender skin and is susceptible to skin cancer. This product does help to protect his skin and absorbs well. Moisturizing and not greasy! Great product.,5,0,B00F97FHAW
"Leaves a white cast and residue on your face after applying. The sunscreen is also thick and hard to apply evenly, not at all like Cerave's moisturizing cream.",2,One,B00F97FHAW
If you’re here because of a Tik tok video... let me save ya time and money lol the 1 thing I looked for in a sunscreen is no white residue or glossy finish. I came to order this because I thought it would be Matt because of that Tik tok and unfortunately it wasn’t true... ugh I am definitely disappointed this made my face glossier and never went “Matt” also leaves a slightly white residue and when you try and blend it out more it starts clumping up .. 🙃,2,One,B00F97FHAW
"I have very sensitive skin and needed a morning moisturizer. I have oily skin and am medically diagnosed with cystic acne. This moisturizer did not aggravate my acne or sensitive skin. It's very lightweight also, so it could be used under makeup.",5,2,B00F97FHAW
I absolutely love this lotion!!! It feels light on your skin yet provides deep moisture. It has been wonderful for my sensitive skin and provides great sun protection. I now use their whole line of skin care !!!,5,One,B00F97FHAW
"I have really sensitive skin and it is hard for me to find sunscreen that doesn't irritate me. I previously used Purito, a Korean brand, that's way more expensive and even that irritated my skin. I tried to use this CeraVe one and it is amazing so far. Very moisturizing and lightweight. It feels just like a moisturizer with sunscreen, which I absolutely love!",5,2,B00F97FHAW
Beware. Leaves a white residue and also balls up on the skin. Wish I would have read the other reviews that experienced the same occurrence before I purchased.. Will use on my arms and chest.,1,2,B00F97FHAW
This stuff has been wonderful for me! I have not had any irritation with it and it moisturizes my skin without feeling greasy. I also do not get a white cast with this one. I also love the fact that my skin is getting protection from the sun as well!,5,One,B00F97FHAW
I like some Cerve products. This is not one of them. I have pretty dry skin and this product did nothing for me. Might be fine for someone with normal/oily skin but definitely not for someone with dry skin.,2,One,B00F97FHAW
"Much to my wife's disappointment, this product was not moisturizing at all. It clumped and left a thick residue on her face after immediate application. Not sure if it was a bad batch, or just reacted poorly with the Vitamin c serum used underneath, but after reading the prior reviews, sounds like this is a common occurrence. Will not be purchasing again.",1,2,B00F97FHAW
"leaves a white cast, lots of pilling with any other product i use and difficult to spread across my face to the point where i’m stretching my skin. i have to use a little to prevent the white cast so it’s even worse because it’s a little bit that i have to really work across my skin.",2,0,B00F97FHAW
"Very irritating to my eyes, doesn’t absorb well and tends to clump and peel off my skin.",3,2,B00F97FHAW
"My favorite lotion with sunscreen! I love this product! I use two pumps in the morning to protect my skin from the sun. It’s a good thickness, soaks in well, and doesn’t hurt my eyes. Highly recommend! I love cerave and this is another great product.",5,One,B00F97FHAW
When I purchased this I thought it was more like a facial moisturizer than sunscreen. It does hydrate my skin well and the sunblock is an added bonus but I feel like it's hard to spread evenly due to the texture being more like sunscreen.,4,0,B00F97FHAW
"I know cerave is hailed as the best for sensitive skin but I broke out in small hives every time I used this product and I can usually tolerate most moisturizers fine. I also found it kind of greasy, but I would have dealt with that had it been moisturizing enough (it was just okay) and didn’t make my skin worse. I ended up giving it away. Glad I only ordered a small bottle to try.",1,3,B00F97FHAW
After years of using a certain product suddenly my skin was breaking out constantly! I wanted to experiment with something that was oil free. I now use all of Cera Ve’s products and my skin has never looked better.,5,One,B00F97FHAW
"I really like this stuff. The cap prevents any spilling when I travel as well. It goes on smoothly and one pump is plenty. I have mildly sensitive skin around my eyes and some SPF moisturizer gives me watery eyes, but this doesn’t!!",5,0,B00F97FHAW
"I wanted to like this product but sadly I don’t. I tried it once, it made me break out. I tried it a second time, thinking maybe it would be better. It wasn’t. I am not prone to breakouts either. Won’t be recommending or purchasing.",1,0,B00F97FHAW
"I can’t Eva,hate how well this moisturizes or protects from the sun because i was unable to use this product because it is SO THICK. It’s like putting butter on your face if butter were less smooth. It felt disgusting and I don’t know what to do with the bottle now because I will never use it again. What a waste of plastic packaging! ‘‘Tis is a shame because the PM moisturizer is really good.",1,One,B00F97FHAW
Love this moisturizer!!!! Not greasy like some can be. I have very dry skin and this works well.,5,2,B00F97FHAW
"I bought this to replace my daily sunscreen and its a great substitute for that! No white cast, and good ingredients. However, since this is also marketed as a moisturizing lotion, I do have to say it does the opposite and dries my skin out. So I need to use a moisturizer under it to make up for the dryness. It's a small inconvenience for a great daily sunscreen though!",4,0,B00F97FHAW
"My girlfriend bought this for me to get me a light moisturizer with decent sun protection. I used to use the play moisturizer but the SPF wasn’t enough.
According to her I have combination/oily skin no acne. She also has the same type but acne prone.
This moisturizer has very basic sun protection (SPF 30)
But it is kinda thick, very hard to blend in and it leaves a horrible white cast.
I asked for a refund/return and got no answer (patently terrible customer service too!)
Will not purchase again.",1,0,B00F97FHAW
"I have tried this moisturizer for one month so far. I have used it with the gentle face cleanser from Cerave. Every time I go into the sun for more that 10 minutes, my cheeks begin to burn and itch. I do not have sensitive skin. I use moisturizer because I have normal to dry skin and I wanted sun protection. You would think that this product, since it is mostly advertised as a sun screen, would perform better in the sun. But I unfortunately hurts to wear when you go into the sun.",1,One,B00F97FHAW
"Feels like light regular facial moisturizer and
I love how it doesn't feel so thick, oily and heavy like other sunscreens. It doesn't exacerbate my rosacea with being unscented. I love that I can use it for my kids and not feel guilty about putting lotion with unnecessary chemicals on their face.",5,One,B00F97FHAW
"I’m a long-time user of CeraVe products, and this is a good addition to my collection. I much prefer having lotion with spf rather than dealing with two separate products. This one gives me the impression that the gazillion lines in my face are a little less obvious—whether they are or not is, to be honest, pretty immaterial. I will buy this product again.",5,0,B00F97FHAW
"I really wanted to like this because my dermatologist always recommends cerave but it’s not my favorite. I have fair, super sensitive skin and while it did not irritate my skin, it does leave a white residue behind and it’s really hard to blend in.",3,0,B00F97FHAW
"I love how this product is safe for myself, my husband, and our 10 year old daughter. The product does not clog pores for the 3 different skin types in our household.",5,2,B00F97FHAW
This moisturizer made me break out almost immediately. I mentioned it to my friend and she said the same thing happened to her and other friends who used it. Definitely do not recommend.,1,3,B00F97FHAW
"My dermatologist recommended this lotion to me after I was having some trouble with eczema on my face. I'm really happy with using it so far and just bought another bottle. It definitely didn't irritate my skin further (I've always had very sensitive skin) and it even seemed to help calm the eczema patches. It does a really good job of moisturizing my skin as well, even in winter. I like that there is SPF in it too. I know it's important to wear sunscreen every day, but I have sensitive/combination/acne-prone skin and it's always been harding finding a sunscreen that didn't make my skin feel slick or tacky with so many products on it. This doesn't feel heavy or leave my skin feeling greasy and I like that it's both sunscreen and moisturizer in one.",5,0,B00F97FHAW
"Good luck to me 😂.
I bought it to prove how well my dry skin works. For now, I can only show you how my package arrived. and Well, really blindly I can recommend the brand, because a product that I have tried is CERAVE Resurfing Retinol SERUM, and it has done wonders on my face with pimple spots.",5,One,B00F97FHAW

"My face did not like this product at all. =[ It leaves a white filmy residue on my face and if I try putting makeup over the top it starts coming off of my face as little white flecks. I also started to break out from it, which is not something I am used to having happen. I am pretty disappointed in this product, which is sad because I love CeraVe products normally.",1,2,B00F97FHAW
"a lot of people recommend this sunscreen because Cerave is a reliable brand but let me tell you this, if your skin is acne prone D O N O t buy this. I have pretty normal skin but I tend to get minor breakouts but this sunscreen amplified it. At first I thought maybe it was because I was using my normal lotion and sunscreen so the next day I decided to just put on the sunscreen. Big m I s take. •_• I woke up with clear skin and by night time I felt like (and looked) like greasy 12 year old . *sobs* my clear skin . This might not be the case for everyone but If you have hormonal/or acne prone skin save your money.(also leaves a white cast)",3,One,B00F97FHAW
"It's good a sun screen but its too thick and does not moisturize the skin. You need to wear a good moisturizer before applying this. it is so thick that it also shows up the white patches but effective for mild sun at SPF 30. If you need stronger protection , you should look at atleast 50 SPF.",4,0,B00F97FHAW
"I love Cerave and use tons of their products, but this is a no go. It felt so heavy and even pilled up when I rubbed it in. I even felt like it was clogging my pores. It felt like if you were at the beach and you had no makeup on and wanted straight up sunscreen. Not the daily moisturizer for under makeup that I expected. Would not recommend.",2,0,B00F97FHAW
"I'm sure the product works as it says, I had no reactions, but my face looks like an oil slick, an unattractive look, reminds me of my grandmother before going to bed years ago!
As with other CeraVe products, the pump is adequate at best.",2,0,B00F97FHAW
"I normally like this brand a lot so assumed this would be good. This does not feel like a moisturizer, it does not absorb well and pills up HORRIBLY on your skin. You have to barely rub it at all before it starts balling up. Forget trying to apply makeup over this. I'm sure the spf is effective enough but as a moisturizer? No. Very disappointed to have paid nearly 15 bucks for this.",3,0,B00F97FHAW
"I thought I’d buy this instead of the Cardon moisturizer +SPF for men and save some money. I ended up having to buy it anyway. It leaves flakey residue on my beard that makes it look like I have beard dandruff. It does also leave some on my face but I’ve found I can manage that if I rub it on my hands enough before applying. 3 stars cause it does the job for the price.

Also, beware this product has ingredients that can aggravate Pityrosporum Folliculitis/fungal acne. Found that by searching the product up on the folliculitis scout website.",3,0,B00F97FHAW

"Provides good sun protection and moisture, but is quite expensive, so I’d love to find a product that isn’t so pricey. The thickness of this lotion requires a thicker than usual coverage which is good for skin, but depletes this small bottle even more quickly.",3,One,B00F97FHAW
"It smells like sunscreen, and goes on like sunscreen but then rubs in really well. Seems pretty weightless too",5,3,B00F97FHAW
I’m really liking this moisturizer so far I searched for a while to find a moisturizer with a higher SPF. this is great! it’s smells a little like sunscreen but it goes on it disappears . Make up goes on nicely over it. Love it!,5,2,B00F97FHAW
"It wouldn’t be a bad product except it “balls up” on my face. I tried waiting 20 minutes to apply it after washing my face and not using any other products under or over it but it doesn’t matter what I do, it won’t absorb fully and the product flakes off of my skin. Annoying AF.",1,2,B00F97FHAW
Love this product. It made a great improvement to my skin & appearance. It only takes a couple weeks & you will notice a very good difference in your facial skin.,5,One,B00F97FHAW
"The moisturizer not being oil based is awesome, but that might be as far as my compliments go? This product never seems to fully absorb into my skin, and I spend most of the day feeling like I need to scrub it off. It says ""with Sunscreen"" but it seems more like a sunscreen first and a moisturizer second. (It also reacts terribly with CeraVe's Hyaluronic Acid Face Serum -- When layered on top of it, it pills and flakes off.)",3,One,B00F97FHAW
I have purchased this item from numerous stores in the past. It typically is sealed and the top is locked. The box of this product was in perfect shape but as soon as I opened it and took the lotion out you could see the bottle had been dropped and had black scuffs all over. I looked inside the box to see if it was on the inside of the box but it was clean inside the box which means the product had to be outside to get those marks. Disappointed for an Amazon product. I will think twice before purchasing these types of products on amazon,1,0,B00F97FHAW
I have ridiculously sensitive skin because I use a retinoid and benzoyl peroxide in the evenings. This does a great job at maintaining moisture and protecting my acid mantle. It smells like sunscreen but I’d rather have a product that works and doesn’t irritate my skin than one that smells pretty.,5,0,B00F97FHAW

"Coming from Eucerin's facial moisturizer, I really like this! Doesn't make my face look very white at all, comparatively. It still does a tiny bit, but I'm guessing that's unavoidable if it has sunscreen in it.

It is a little less liquid than the Eucerin, a little more dry when applying. Not as big a fan of that, but it's not too bad.",5,0,B00F97FHAW
"The first few times I used with -- over my moisturizer and, sometimes, other products, it pilled a lot. It was frustrating because there was no way to wipe it off. And it left a white cast when used with other product. However, I seemed to have figure out the trick: use this completely on its own. I used this first thing in the morning (after using Cerave cream the night before) and it went on nicely. No white cast or pilling and feel moisturizing.",4,0,B00F97FHAW

First of all, this leaves a white sheen as well as bunches up and leaves streaks that you cannot rub in.",1,One,B00F97FHAW
Amazing product as always! Highly recommend to everyone.,5,2,B00F97FHAW

"Accidentally purchased 2 of these not realizing it was a sunscreen moisturizer. The formula is so thick, even when you use a tiny amount. So it takes a while to soak into your face and leaves a white residue. Literally like putting water babies sunscreen on your face. I ran out of my regular cerave yesterday and opened this today and was very disappointed. Went to return, but the window closed yesterday.",2,0,B00F97FHAW

"First of all, when it arrived the box was actually completely OPENED and smooshed (but I used it anyway since the bottle was still sealed). Not only does this leave a tiny (so it’s awful for WOC), if you rub not even hard, it will actually come off. So it’s awful for everyone.

I even saw where someone posted their old bottle ingredients with the new bottle and shown where they’ve changed the recipe. I’m very disappointed and I wouldn’t have ordered this if I had known it would make me break out like this.",2,0,B00F97FHAW
Great for sensitive skin. This is a lightweight moisturizer. It sinks in your skin and does its job. I wouldn't recommend it for dry or aging skin that requires something a little more heavy.,5,0,B00F97FHAW
One of the best sunscreen moisturizers on the market. Been using this for a few years. I also love the Cera Ve cream for deeper moisture at night or in the winter. Great line of products at a reasonable price. I’m a physician and I recommend this to my patients.,5,One,B00F97FHAW
"Excellent drug store line of skin care. CeraVe works to protect the moisture barrier of the skin, and that makes a noticeable difference. I have combo skin. The entire line is great quality.",5,One,B00F97FHAW
"I like the product a lot, it didn’t leave any traces like other people said, and me and my wife have very different skin, it worked for both of us, the only bad thing is the smell, i wish it was a little more subtle but it’s not terrible, I just think it could be better",5,0,B00F97FHAW
"Maybe the product just doesn’t work with my already desert dry skin, but it made my entire face so dry it was flaking! Threw it away after a couple attempts to use it. Waste of $$",1,3,B00F97FHAW
Lightweight and super soft. In the summertime it doesn’t leave your face feeling heavy or dewy which is amazing. During winter for my face it isn’t always enough moisture but I have very dry skin!,5,0,B00F97FHAW
"This is what my dermatologist recommended. It has zinc in it, which offers better sun protection, but it is light and doesn’t turn your face white. I’ve been using it daily for several years and have never felt the need to switch to something fancier.",5,0,B00F97FHAW
"leaves white cast like crazy, pills under makeup, doesnt feel super moisturizing. however a little goes a long way, don’t have to use a ton of product to cover my whole face. still overall disappointed, this brand is usually on point with their products",3,One,B00F97FHAW
"Really smells like sunblock, after purchasing I went back and read reviews, wish I would have done that in the first place. Seems like this isn’t the actual brand but fake. Packaging doesn’t match the actual store brought product I have previously purchased. See picture, no LLC. Do not recommend buying any beauty related products on Amazon anymore with how many fake products I’ve received, how can Amazon allow such false advertising? Who knows what your actually putting on your face",1,0,B00F97FHAW
"NOT for people with sensitive or rosacea prone skin. Felt like my face was burning even after only a few minutes of use. As an alternative, I cannot recommend Sunprise’s SPF 50+ sun cream enough. It absorbs effortlessly and is perfect for sensitive skin.",2,One,B00F97FHAW
"I have sensitive, acne-prone skin. This moisturizer feels really good after applying my various morning treatments, and the SPF stays on all day. I can tell, because sometimes at the end of the day when I rub my eyes, they get irritated from the sunscreen. But that's to be expected. The pump administers the perfect amount of product, and I don't have to use a lot. Recommend.",4,0,B00F97FHAW
"So expensive creme and malfunctioning cream provider. After unlocking the top by turning it right, I'm able to press it but the cream doesn't come out, ever. It's not even possible to take the cream using finger when opened the bottle so there is no workaround to take the cream out if the cream provider doesn't suck out the cream. The mechanism is ridiculous.",1,0,B00F97FHAW
"This lotion is moisturizing, but is fairly thick and smells like sunscreen. I'd recommend it just because added SPF is always good, but it's not as lightweight as their nighttime lotion.",4,0,B00F97FHAW
The few moisturizers I’ve tried made my skin dry and flakey. This doesn’t do that so it’s become my holy grail especially when I go to the beach. The salt water dries out my skin and makes it tight but this keeps my face feeling moisturizered and protected all day. It’s definitely has a sunscreen consistency to it so a little goes a long way.,5,0,B00F97FHAW
"What I like is that my skin did not react. I have psoriasis and sometimes a cream with sunscreen will cause a reaction, but not this time. It is also a good price. The cream is light and has no cheap perfume smell.",4,0,B00F97FHAW
This AM formula is nothing like the PM formula as far as consistency. I love the PM but this was thick and gloppy. Didn't enjoy at all.,1,2,B00F97FHAW
It’s a little thick (because it’s SPF 30) but I love it. I have such dry skin and it works without feeling greasy. I also use the PM and the face wash. Overall a great product to add to my routine.,5,0,B00F97FHAW
"I’ve been using this for a couple weeks now. The product definitely has a sunscreen texture, which I don’t mind I wanted something with a decent spf.
Though I personally feel as though it doesn’t moisturize some problem spots as well, as I end up with a couple dryer areas.",4,0,B00F97FHAW
"I used this product one time and my whole face is now red, burning, irritated, and swollen. This is NOT for sensitive skin. I would not recommend this to my worst enemy. It's awful.",1,0,B00F97FHAW
"This is my new favorite moisturizer! No white casting on my skin, everything absorbed wonderfully. My skin is sensitive and prone to breaking out and I haven't had any issues with that.",5,0,B00F97FHAW
"I read the reviews about this product pilling and bought it anyway because it’s one of the most recommended SPF lotions. I tried it when I got it with absolutely no other products on my skin and it pilled like crazy!!! I have no idea what’s wrong with this formula, but they need to fix it. The white cast was really bad (I have very fair skin and it was super noticeable even on me) and it was super hard to rub in since it kept crumbling on my face. For reference I have normal to combo skin.",1,0,B00F97FHAW
"We use this everyday, all year long. I use it under makeup. Much less expensive than moisturizer from the makeup companies. My husband is a golfer and I got him to start using it. Everyone in the family uses it since two family members have had skin cancer on their face, chest and neck. It's an easy proactive thing to do.",5,One,B00F97FHAW
"Beauty professionals everywhere ask me what I use, and I say CeraVe and they just nod... yes, keep using that! I’m 60 and my face is the same as when I was 30..,,",5,2,B00F97FHAW
"I apply this under my makeup every morning, then spend the day working outside under the intense Texas sun, but you couldn’t tell by looking at me. The sunblock in it works wonders!",5,One,B00F97FHAW
"Unfortunately, like many other reviewers, the product irritated my skin. After a couple of uses, my face is covered in little bumps and super dry skin. :'(

the quest for a good face sunscreen continues...",1,One,B00F97FHAW
"Good for combination skin. I had cetaphil and this is better. My skin is not oily. Kinda pricey but worth coz it will take awhile. Also, don’t apply a lot. Just right and massage a little. Worth the money",4,0,B00F97FHAW
"This is very sticky and tacky, which should not be the case for a sunscreen with only an spf 30. No white cast and very nice ingredients, but doesn’t work well under makeup and makes my skin feel sticky and tacky for hours.",3,0,B00F97FHAW
"This is the only spf 30 moisturizer that I've found that's not too thick/greasy for daily wear. Goes on smooth and doesnt make my makeup slide off like most spf 30 does. It is greasier than spf 15s, though.",5,0,B00F97FHAW
"I’m considering returning this product. I’m very disappointed. I used it for the first time and it left a flaky white film on my face. Also, I understand it has spf in it, but it’s more a sunscreen than a moisturizer. I have had plenty of moisturizers with spf and not one smelled and applied exactly like sunscreen.",1,One,B00F97FHAW
My face burns with this thing I don’t like it,1,One,B00F97FHAW
I feel this product would work best on dry skin. I do not recommend for oily or acne prone skin as it personally made me breakout overnight.,3,One,B00F97FHAW
"A little greasy for people with mixed skin. Also, it can get kind of chunky if you apply it on top of serums. But otherwise it’s a pretty decent, lightweight moisturizer.",4,0,B00F97FHAW
I have acne prone skin and so far this is the first sunscreen I've used that seems to do it all for me. It's moisturizing without being too oily or heavy and didn't make me break out like most sunscreens do. It also has niacinamide and hyaluronic acid which is a plus. Perfect for everyday sun protection :),5,2,B00F97FHAW
"I had high hopes for this product but it left a film on my face almost like it’s a cleanser not a lotion and my face did not feel moisturize at all, Had to wash it off",1,0,B00F97FHAW
I love this CeraVe lotion! It's very gentle on my face and moisturizing. Not to mention its SPF 30 is another plus. My only concern is that the lotion is white and can leave a dull and pasty undertone for my skin if I'm not wearing makeup. I actually purchased it as a dupe for the Fenty moisturizer. A few beauty blogs recommended this product as a dupe but it would be 100% perfect if the formula were tinted a slight light pink (like the Fenty moisturizer) or maybe a yellow?,4,0,B00F97FHAW
"It's a lot thicker than I anticipate. It took quite some time for the weird shine to wear off. It didn't break out my skin, so that's good, but definitely won't purchase again.",3,0,B00F97FHAW
"This moisturizer didn’t give any bad reaction to my skin like what other reviewers have mentioned. However, the texture of this moisturizer is very thick & feels like a sunscreen. The only thing I like about this product is the pump design on the bottle.",2,0,B00F97FHAW
"Not a fan of the incredibly light formula. I have dry skin & this is the least moisturizing of their products - love their other ones, but this isn’t my favorite spf.",3,0,B00F97FHAW
"It didn’t feel like moisturizer, it felt like sunscreen from the beach. It’s way too heavy and you have to RUB it in or your face will be left white. Go for the lightweight one, it works great and feels sooo much better.",3,0,B00F97FHAW
First time buying this - it replaced my cetaphil moisturizer w/sunscreen. This one feels a little bit lighter but still strong enough to keep me moisturized and protected. Love it,5,0,B00F97FHAW
I've been trying to find a daily SPF moisturizer for a while now and this is it! This one is light enough to not cause breakouts and doesn't irritate my skin or eyes.,5,0,B00F97FHAW
I used this product after a treatment for cancer on my face. It’s light and most important it has a sunscreen to protect my skin. I highly recommend this product!,5,One,B00F97FHAW
My friend told me about a dermatologist client of hers with amazing skin. She couldn’t believe her age! She said her secret was Retin A and CeraVe AM Moisturizing Lotion with sunscreen. This is my second bottle of the moisturizer lotion. I don’t go out without it on.,5,0,B00F97FHAW
"Its lightweight and looks good underneath makeup but if my eyes water at all, it blends with the formula and burns but I think that may be with any sunblock based product.",5,0,B00F97FHAW
"Perfect morning moisturizer. It’s lightweight, not oily and easy to apply. The only downside is that the sunscreen smell is a little too strong. However, 10/10 would recommend.",5,0,B00F97FHAW
"I love CeraVe as a brand. This is a great daily sunscreen/moisturizer.
Pros:
Not greasy
Light
Easy to apply
Neutral scent
Cons:
I guess for some people it breaks them out",5,One,B00F97FHAW
I started using this product and after two days of using my skin was bright red and burning. I stopped using it and now it is so dry and peeling all over. Don't recommend for sensitive skin,1,One,B00F97FHAW
It hasn't made my skin react badly but it is not impressive as a sunscreen. It does not sink into my skin that well and leaves white flakes on my skin. I am not buying this again.,3,0,B00F97FHAW
this is a great Light weight daily moisturizer with sunscreen. My go to.......,5,One,B00F97FHAW
It great for my skin. It a mixture between dry and oily.,5,One,B00F97FHAW
"It pills a lot. Takes a lot of time to settle on the skin and it is not as smooth as a mosturising cream should be. I wish I could return it, but unfortunately I’ve thrown the packaging. I expected better from cerave😢",2,One,B00F97FHAW
"So i used this today in the AM. I wish i hadnt bought this. It gives a white cast, is thick, and not very moisturizing. I feel like if i touch my face or someone else does, the product is going to come off. It was very hard to blend in; it felt as if i were applying foundation instead of a moisturizer. i am going to return.",1,One,B00F97FHAW
"Turns out I'm allergic to this and it burnt my face (badly). Everyone is different, but I was really quite soar and red for days after that. Thought I should say something.",1,One,B00F97FHAW
"I previously rated this 3 stars, but I have returned a star because I figured out a way to apply this and avoid a strong whitecast and avoid the pilling. Still I do not think this is much of a moisturizer. It feels like a regular sunscreen with added ingredients found in moisturizers. I do love that this product is so gentle though. I have had absolutely no issues with burning (sensations or from the sun), and in today's world of products, I think this is amazing.",4,0,B00F97FHAW
this product came unpack aged suspicious it was used.,1,One,B00F97FHAW
No good. It leaves white cast and overall not moisturizing and not fun to use. I thought its going to be moisturizing lotion that has sun protection. I won’t buy again and don’t want to recommend to people. I think ingredients are not bad but no good,2,0,B00F97FHAW
Was hopeful after reading reviews on this product but I can't even tolerate using it because of how strongly it smells of sunscreen once applied. Consistency is that of sunscreen as well,1,One,B00F97FHAW
"I’ve been using this everyday for over a year now and love it. I have sensitive slightly dry/normal skin and this easily spreads and absorbs for easy application. It doesn’t leave my skin oily or sticky, although I like to add another sunscreen on top of this moisturizer.
Great Product!",5,0,B00F97FHAW
"Great sunscreen, moisturizing and it’s not heavy or pasty. I have olive skin so there’s no white cast. However I have sensitive acne prone skin and I feel like sometimes I get pimples because of it. But I’m not too sure that’s why I give it a 3 out of five.",3,One,B00F97FHAW
"pretty good for a moisturizer. it doesn’t feel sticky or greasy and leaves my skin feeling soft. my skin i also isn’t super sensitive though. as for sun protection, i’m naturally pretty tan and wanted to use it for the moisturizer.",3,One,B00F97FHAW
I don't hate this stuff and I use it before spending a day outside but its thick and feels like sunscreen. It applies like sunscreen.. leaves a white residue that you have to keep working into your skin. There are probably better facial moisturizers out there.,3,2,B00F97FHAW
Recommended by Dermatogist works great!!,5,One,B00F97FHAW
"How about the sunscreen effect? I don’t know yet, but I can’t put makeup on my face after it’s been rubbed with mud.",1,2,B00F97FHAW
"I wanted to love this product because I love CeraVe but honestly, it smells too much like straight up sunscreen and it leaves my face looking shiny. Just buy a different moisturizer.",3,0,B00F97FHAW
It's pretty thin but still leaves a bit of a white residue. I wear it on my face every day and I don't have a reaction to it. (My skin is very sensitive.),5,0,B00F97FHAW
"My dermatologist recommended this sunscreen & I love it. It blends well without white residue & does not have a strong sunscreen odor, absorbs quickly so you can put makeup on shortly after applying.",5,One,B00F97FHAW
"I've been using this for several years (and every time I try a different kind of sunscreen, I like them less, so I always go back to this one.) I have very sensitive skin.",5,0,B00F97FHAW
"Thick, heavy and pasty. A slight white hue is left on the skin after application. Does not absorbs quickly. Several allergen ingredients. One of the top ingredients is alcohol which drys your skin. I will not buy again. I now use Aveeno its everything CerVa wishes it could be and not harmful to my face and does not contain carcinogens.
I do really like how the cream comes out from the push pump. It's just the right amount.",2,0,B00F97FHAW
I love CeraVe generally but this one doesn't penetrate the skin. It crumbles and stays white on the skin. That means that I have to keep on searching,3,0,B00F97FHAW
"I have light/tan skin but I had much difficulty getting the whiteness of the lotion to actually soak up and blend into my skin. There would always be spots I missed, leaving white residue on areas such as my neck line etc.",2,One,B00F97FHAW
"This leaves a white sheen on the skin that does not go away with time. On my dark skin especially, the sheen has a particularly horrendous effect. I do not recommend for people with dark skin or warm undertones.",3,0,B00F97FHAW
No satisfaction here!,2,One,B00F97FHAW
"I purposely bought this product because alcohol was not listed as an ingredient..then I receive the bottle and sure enough- alcohol is in an ingredient. I cannot use this and will be throwing it in the garbage, just as I essentially did with the $13 I paid for it....",1,3,B00F97FHAW
"I use this every morning, without fail. I think of it as putting my shield on before braving the Texas sun. Gotta prevent those wrinkles!

I don’t find it to be very oily, and it absorbs pretty quickly. Sweating on hot days briefly when heading to the car results in a mild sunscreen scent and residue. It goes away quickly upon cooking off, though.",5,One,B00F97FHAW
It leaves a terrible white cast. So I definitely don't recommend this for other brown and black people.,1,2,B00F97FHAW
"I was super disappointed by this product. I use the night cream which is amazing. However this product isn’t worth the buy. It won’t rub into your face and feels like you’re just rubbing all the dead skin off as you’re applying and then it just sits on your face.
NOT WORTH IT.",1,0,B00F97FHAW
It is a great moisturizer with sun protection,5,One,B00F97FHAW
It’s very thick and hard to apply on. Totally turns your face white. Doesn’t feel like a moisturizer-more like sun screen. It’s not easy to apply to your face.,2,One,B00F97FHAW
My new fave spf moisturizer. I have sensitive eyes and I have no issues with this product. A little goes a long way and my skin is protected.,5,One,B00F97FHAW
I’m disappointed because I love the CeraVe products. I thought this would be a nice facial moisturizer with added sunscreen. It doesn’t feel like a moisturizer. It is thick and white and takes a while to rub it in. Then my face feels so tight. Make up is not easy to apply over it. I’ll save it for summer use as a sunscreen only. Not a moisturizer.,1,One,B00F97FHAW
"I was really excited to try this facial lotion, I have acne prone and oily skin and read many positive reviews. I used it one time and a few hours later my face and eyelids were on fire and red. My face has reacted this way previously to sunscreens, so I'm assuming it was those ingredients that caused this.

Would not recommend if your skin is sensitive to sunscreen.",2,0,B00F97FHAW
You can definitely tell that it has sunscreen in it. It leaves a white overcast and is very greasy. I would only use this during summer.,4,One,B00F97FHAW

"Terrible product and the upsetting part is, it has high reviews. I can not use this for a daily face moisturizer I would not recommend at all. It leaves a flaky white film on my face and gets worse after applying makeup. It is the worst of all face creams I have tried. Do not waste your money...I’ll be throwing this product away.",1,One,B00F97FHAW
Caused cystic acne. Would not recommend for anyone with sensitive skin. Also made my skin appear oily,2,One,B00F97FHAW
not worth the price but could just be my skin vs the formulation. left me with a slight but noticeable cast (i’m fitzpatrick 4) and pilled a lot especially noticeable on any facial hair it came in contact with,2,One,B00F97FHAW

"Its advertised as a moisturizer but its just sunscreen. I wanted a moisturizer with SPF, not just a straight up facial sunscreen. I'll still use it for that reason, but certainely not daily. Feels very heavy on my skin....like....sunscreen.",2,0,B00F97FHAW
My only complaint is you can see and feel the sunscreen. I like it in moisturizer or foundations where it’s a little more discrete. It’s thicker like a sunscreen and you can visibly see the white tint with more oily texture. I started using their PM moisturizer instead.,2,0,B00F97FHAW
Amazing face lotion,5,0,B00F97FHAW
Love this product. Leaves my skin soft. Not sticky.,5,0,B00F97FHAW

"I don’t like the feel of sunscreen. You can definitely tell it has sunscreen in it, but once it absorbs there is no residue. So it’s a win in my book!",5,0,B00F97FHAW
Doesn't stay and pills no matter what you do.,1,One,B00F97FHAW
The only thing I dislike is the white tint it leaves. I'm a POC and with a fair tan complex. You see a white tint after applying this so maybe apply it early on if you are heading out. Other than that I like it! I,4,One,B00F97FHAW

"I recently discovered of this wonderful moisturizer.
I've been looking for a great moisturizer with sunscreen without breaking the bank. I am 51 years old & picky about what I use & I really love this moisturizer for my daily moisturizer",5,0,B00F97FHAW
So the product itself is amazing. Unfortunately the pump doesn’t work at all so I’m stuck unscrewing it and slathering it on my face by rubbing whatever’s on the tubing onto my face.,4,0,B00F97FHAW

"Really great everyday moisturizer/sunscreen combination. I apply this 15 minutes prior to heading outdoors and even with sweat, the formulation does not make my eyes itch. If the products get in your eyes, do rinse out thoroughly. Overall, really enjoy the moisturizer/sunscreen combination.",5,0,B00F97FHAW
"Awful. I was hoping for this to be my new daily moisturizer but I hated it upon first use. It’s really thick and hard to rub in, making your face appear white. It feels and smells more like a thick sunscreen than a moisturizing lotion.",1,0,B00F97FHAW
My fave face lotion ..,5,0,B00F97FHAW
"First amazon review ever? I’m a pretty man, so I tend to notice the daily sunscreens that leave behind the white residue making me even paler. This one did not change my skin tone at all. It’s smell vanishes when you put it on, and it’s not sticky at all. I would recommend this one.",5,One,B00F97FHAW
"3 oz sunscreen moisturizer pump is difficult to push, even with a hammer, must be defective, bought 3 all same.
I use cleanser 14 oz and moisturizer 12 oz in pump with no pump problems.
3 oz sunscreen moisturizer does not moisturize like the 12 oz pump.",2,0,B00F97FHAW

"Trust me, when you start using this product, forget about other things. Love it!",5,One,B00F97FHAW
"Only used once, only in the sun for an hour. Later that night my face was bright red and burning. Woke up the next day with my eyes so swollen I could barely open them. Very confused because this brand is usually safe so not sure if Amazon is selling a fake or what.",1,0,B00F97FHAW
"Great for the price, but I felt it was a bit too ""sticky"". It's quite thick and doesn't feel very light. I will use up this bottle but will probably not buy this again.",4,0,B00F97FHAW
Too oily.,3,0,B00F97FHAW
"Best product on market for acne control with dry skin, container is too small and is wasteful of plastic.",4,0,B00F97FHAW
"Over-priced Suntan Lotion. This has the feel of ""No Ad"" suntan lotion. Feels greasey and does not blend into skin (stays white). I thought this would be a good moisturizer but it not. Also, it does not make it easy to apply make-up.",1,0,B00F97FHAW
I thought this moisturizer was really disappointing. It does not at all melt into the skin or feel like I’m hydrating my skin. It feels like a sunscreen. I will save it for make up free summer days but otherwise I will not use this.,2,0,B00F97FHAW
Product applies clumpy. Very difficult if not impossible to spread evenly on face. Heavy. Will never buy again.,1,0,B00F97FHAW
"This product leaves a mask on my skin and I'm pretty pale. I've tried rubbing it in more, but when I do it crumbles into little white flakes that look just awful. I put it on only to have to wash it off right after! I don't recommend this product.",2,0,B00F97FHAW
"My bottle arrived and the pump didn't work, I was quickly offered an exchange no questions asked. As always CeraVe doesn't disappoint in a quality product that does what it says it will do.",5,0,B00F97FHAW
"Feels soft to touch initially but as you spread, it's hard NOT to pill. Using this up as quickly as I can as a face and body sunscreen so I can get rid of it quicker. The SPF protection is solid but the application is not great.",3,0,B00F97FHAW
"It was moisturizing, but it still felt oily on my skin and left a white cast. I normally love CeraVe’s products, but this just didn’t measure up to me. Their Hydrating Sunscreen Face Sheer Tint SPF 30, however, I absolutely love (with some moisturizer under it).",2,0,B00F97FHAW
Best bang for the buck. Has all the $$$ chemicals that the expensive brands charge more for. It’s all you need at a bargain price. Isn’t oily and a little goes a long way.,5,0,B00F97FHAW

"I’ve been using this product for 2 weeks now and every time I put it on, it leaves white streaks on my face. It’s not moisturizing so I can’t continue to rub/pat into my skin. It clumps up",1,0,B00F97FHAW
CeraVe doesn't moisturize your skin. Maybe it is just a sunscreen. I have dry skin and was nivea moisturizer all my life. I switched to CeraVe and results of using it for a week is the dry patches in the pic. I never had such dry patches before.,1,0,B00F97FHAW
"This is too thick and cakes up. Leaves your skin flakey, dull and oily. I have normal skin . Would not buy this brand again .",2,0,B00F97FHAW

I wish I read the reviews more carefully before purchasing. The other one star reviews were spot on! This lotion pilled on my face and NOTHING I did could get it to rub in. It also burned my sensitive skin. It immediately turned red and inflammed. I would not recommend!,1,0,B00F97FHAW

It is light and goes on easy. It takes a minute or two to soak into your skin which is why I’m giving 4 stars because it can make the hair around my face greasy if I don’t put powder on top of it. I don’t typically wear foundation and powder so that is a bit annoying.,4,0,B00F97FHAW

Non greasy feel,5,0,B00F97FHAW
"Bottle is nice and tiny, good ingredient list. It doesn't feel heavy after applying, doesn't look bad either.
The only problem with it is that it is hard to absorb, you have to rub it for quite a while before the whiteness goes away",5,One,B00F97FHAW
This stuff was so exciting at first. It did not go well under makeup. I also wore it without make up and the little white bits of material residue were left on my face throughout the day.,2,0,B00F97FHAW

Stinky & leaves face greasy.,1,0,B00F97FHAW
Non irritating but the sunscreen component does make it less moisturizing. I only use this during the summer and always apply the pm moisturizer before using this to ensure my skin is not dry.,4,0,B00F97FHAW

"I’ve tried using this product on its own, under makeup, without makeup, with other moisturizers, small amount, and a large amount.

"I don’t like the consistency of this, it is too thick, it’s like a cheap sunscreen that you bought for the beach, leaves my face so sticky and not very moisturizing, this is not something you want on your face just after clean it.",2,0,B00F97FHAW
I bought it because it calls itself face lotion. It is sunblock. The small print on the bottle says that its only use is for sun protection. I wanted to buy lotion for sensitive/dry skin. I bought sunblock.,2,One,B00F97FHAW
I bought this as a daytime moisturizer with sunscreen protection. This lotion flakes off my face. It is awful!,1,0,B00F97FHAW

"This is absolutely my favorite moisturizer! I have combination skin and HATE sunscreens, but love this product. It soaks in fast and goes great under mineral and liquid makeup.",5,0,B00F97FHAW
I didn’t like how it pilled up so easily and didn’t seem to blend into my skin very easily. It made my mustache look like I had white stuff which was not flattering. Also made my skin oily.

I've found that unless I fully exfoliate my skin (with an electric facial scrubbing brush) the lotion does not absorb into my skin and will rub off (like dry skin) before it's fully blended into the skin.

"Jan 15 2019

I do not know if it is the real Olaplex or not.
But I love this stuff. I started bleaching sessions since October 2018. I probably bleached 9x since. I reached to a point of extreme damage where my hair felt soo weak it would not even air dry on its own. It felt & looked like noodles & very gummy. It would take me maybe an hr to brush out my hair because of all the damage/breakage.

I started taking better care for my hair.
I stopped using 10$ shampoos & started buying quality shampoos & deep hair conditioners + hair masks + oils + oraganic virgin oils.

All these products did work for saving my hair , I did see improvement in time.

But with one use of OLAPLEX ❤
Made my hair very soft & silky + healthier looking .
I usually use a special detangling brush because of all the knots I get from breakage & from all the bleaching I've done to my hair.

With Olaplex 3 I no longer struggle to brush my hair or run my fingers without them getting stuck in my hair from tangles of dryed brittle hair.
This stuff is just what my damaged hair needed.
This was just half the bottle used on my 26inches of hair. I still have half left.

At first I was hesitant on buying because not only was it very expensive but it is a very small bottle.
I am soo glad I bought this.

"I have used a whole bottle of the olaplex now. While i have seen some results, they were not as great as I expected. I have since tried several other products, including Redken PH, and Pronexa Bond repair.  Hairgenics Pronexa Hair Bond Repairing Complex  The Pronexa bond repair is superior in just about every way. Smells better, has a better consistency, and I got vastly better results in fixing the damage to my hair, and this was AFTER going through an entire bottle of olaplex. Redken PH was also decent, but I prefer the pronexa",3,"1,446",B00SNM5US4
"There are a number of reviews here claiming that the product purchased through Amazon is fake...to find out if this is true, I purchased one bottle here on Amazon and one directly from the Olaplex website (the product price is the same, but I saved $5 here on shipping because I am a Prime member)...I compared the two on appearance of packaging and product and on performance. Verdict: identical. The stuff ordered through Amazon is NOT fake. That said, it's expensive either way, and not a miracle worker, but if you have damaged hair it's worth a try-- I have babyfine processed hair so I will continue to use it-- and I will buy it confidently through Amazon.",4,"3,164",B00SNM5US4
"As many reviews stated, this is the worst thing to happen to my hair. My hair literally broke in half. I didn't change anything about my routine.

"It was a sad day after using this ""Olaplex"". This product did not work, but further damaged my hair... I actually slept in this product, which could have just dried out my hair? I'm not sure... but it made by hair more tangled and brittle. How?! I don't know. I have naturally dark brown hair and lightened it with manic panic about 3 months prior to using this product and had routinely used deep conditioners and coconut oil, but decided to try olaplex before going another shade lighter and that was a sad mistake. Literally had to cut off my ends as there were straw like. I've postponed re-bleaching my hair and I've been using coconut oil treatments once a week to recover from this product. Good luck!",1,601,B00SNM5US4

I went to get it colored to give it a break from the highlights, I was going to change it to a strawberry blonde, which I have been many times before and other than blonde, its the only other color I like on me. When I went to the salon, they messed up the color. I ended up with hot pinkish, purple roots and a grayish auburn, mid-shaft to ends. I was in the salon that day for 7 and a half hours. They had to bleach my entire head and leave it on to get all of the screwed up colors out of my hair, resulting to EXTREME chemical damage and breakage. I went in with my hair being all one length to having bangs that were never even cut into my hair. My hair was destroyed and they had to take over 5inches off just to get the ends to LOOK healthy. My hair now sits on my shoulders and has broken pieces all over the top and mid section and all around my hair line. I have literally cried about this since it happened 5 weeks ago. It took me forever to get my hair exactly the way I wanted it and now I am starting over. My hair is no longer manageable, it is kinky and dry and looks it! The salon I had gone to was a new salon closer to where I moved. Prior to this salon I had been going to my original hairstylist for 15 years (I'm 30) so half of my life one person has touched my hair. I live two hours from her now so I decided to give a different salon a try and it was a mistake. I will now be driving 2 hours to go to her every 8 weeks. I texted her about 2 weeks after this all happened and she told me right away to order this product. I didn't hesitate. I ordered it and received it the beginning of this week. I have used it twice so far and I will tell you what, after the first time I noticed a difference! I am excited to see after a couple months and using this 3 times a week (Extremely damaged hair should use it more than once a week). I also have been sleeping with it on over night which I notice gives me better results. This is not a conditioning treatment, so it does need to be shampooed out. I have a feeling this product will be what saves my hair. I will post before and after pictures once I actually do my hair so you can see the difference!",5,"1,394",B00SNM5US4
"After my stylist left the bleach on entirely too long, my hair needed major help. My ends felt stringy, rough, and mostly just broke when touched/brushed/were wet. It was a mess.

I ordered this product from Amazon rather than the olaplex website because I needed it NOW. When I read some of the reviews that said it was fake and counterfeit, I got nervous and ordered the other one directly from the company.

This is the exact same product. Both this and the one I ordered direct have significantly improved the condition of my hair. I can actually touch it again and it feels like hair instead of hay.

Oddly, the label on the one from the company was bubbly and looked more fake than the Amazon bottle. I don't know if ALL these come from the same distributor but I'm glad I got the real thing.

I would definitely recommend trying this if you have damaged hair! If your hair is generally in good condition, I'm not sure the type of results you would get. I imagine it wouldn't be as drastically different as mine.",5,802,B00SNM5US4
"I bought this bc the hype about Olaplex, and my hair is normally black and lifted to a level 9, so I do have breakage, damage, split ends etc. So I used this about 3x now and my hair is softer, shinier, but still has some breakage, and you know those white ends at the end of my hair shaft from prior breakage at the bottom. So I got paranoid reading some reviews that it's not real blah blah. So I bought 2 from the Olaplex website and they are the same, same consistency, same smell, same bottle, same effect. So unless they manufacture dupes better than professional knockoffs this is legit Olaplex and you just have to keep doing the treatment until your hair is at your desired health.

BTW: AMAZON OLAPLEX ON THE LEFT, OLAPLEX DIRECT FROM WEBSITE ON THE RIGHT",5,766,B00SNM5US4
"Extremely disappointed. I have the real product ordered from the company. Both color texture, scent is miles off. Not to mention result. It does NOTHING! I guess at this rate I am relived it didnt damage my hair. It is like dirty colored water. Also the bottle is a clear &obvious faux. The plastic used, the label who peels of if it gets wet even indicate worthless glue! The print on the label is a poor copy. The faux #printed under the bottle doesnt even contain any accurate code. The cap is even inferior & doesn't stay on properly. It seem Amazon got a major problem with faux products lately. I used to shop a ton on Amazon ,still do. But dont think I can continue that practise any more. Hair products, skincare, supplements, make up...Who want to spend thousands at Amazon in a month &get products that does nothing or worse cause damage in some cases? Stay away from this seller for Olaplex 3!",1,104,B00SNM5US4
"I was foolish and tried to bleach my hair myself and dye it purple. Of course that didn't turn out so great. I bleached it twice in one day because I couldn't get my natural dark hair light enough. After it dried I was horrified at the damage I had done and my hair wasn't even blonde lol. My hair was FRIED. When I touched the ends it felt like pubic hair. Sorry for my description but that's the best way I can describe it.

I took the risk buying this on Amazon. I was worried it wouldn't work since I never did step 1 and 2 but oh my gosh it worked. After watching tutorials on youtube on how to properly apply it to damp hair I was surprised at how much better it felt. It's not a miracle product, ladies and gentleman. I still had to cut some of my ends but I didn't have to cut as much as I originally anticipated. I may update pictures when i'm in better lighting so you can see proof.

Piece of advice. Apply on damp hair. This helps you use less product. Section your hair and make sure your hair is saturated. Trust me, you don't have to use the whole bottle even if you have long hair. A small amount will coat your hair. I have hair past my shoulders and have done three treatments and still have a lot in my bottle. Also, use a wide tooth brush on your hair to make sure it is coated evenly.

I left it on for about 15 to 20 minutes and then added a hair mask on top of it and waited about 10 more minutes with it wrapped. After that I rinsed it with cool water with a tiny bit of shampoo at the scalp area.

I did not towel dry my hair since it can be harsh on brittle hair. Instead I gently twisted my hair to remove excess water. While my hair was damp I applied oil only to my ends and let it air dry.

My hair feels amazing! Good luck guys! If you guys have just dry hair you probably don't need to do all the steps I did but I totally destroyed my hair. And i'm telling you, just the product alone made my hair feel soft.",5,146,B00SNM5US4
"Let me start by saying this thing is a miracle worker! I've been hearing about this for years but never had a damaging chemical process that I'd need to use it, until now. I decided to dye my hair blue, it's something I have been wanting to do for years but didn't want to bleach my full head, I have reddish brown hair, a medium to dark brown, that I dye with permanent hair color, so I bleached my entire head with 40 volume peroxide and bleach powder, luckily my hair bleached easily to a very pale blonde that I didn't need to bleach again, but that first round destroyed my curly hair. I have loose curls/waves and my hair looked like brillo when it was dry. I was so nervous, I couldn't comb through, it was elastic, it was a mess. I then dyed it using Arctic fox hair dye which is vegan, no chemicals and moisturizes the hair. My hair then looked great color wise, it was soft but looked fried, and I mean fried!!! That was Last Monday, so I spent the week doing loads of Argan oil, had to flat iron it to help hide the extreme damage, but still the ends would look super dry and pretty much like brillo, and we had the worst week in NYC, hot and very humid, which didn't help at all. So I decided to buy this, was skeptical about the ""Fake"" reviews, so I bought directly from amazon and not third party sellers, just to be extra sure. I received the product sealed, looking fine. The consistency is thick, its very concentrated. I washed my hair with sulfate free shampoo to remove all the Argan oil i used and then put Olaplex all over my hair, combed, put a shower cap and let it stay for 2 hours. Then rinsed, shampooed and put a ""It's a 10"" hair mask for about 10 minutes and massaged it on my hair. And wow, just wow, my hair felt like hair again, I was able to blow dry it straight with a comb, and NO and I mean Not a single hair got stuck or broke off on the brush! My hair is back to life! It's soft, shiny, super strong and I""m so happy again!!! This pic is from a couple of hours after I used it and you can see it looks like hair and not a steel sponge! Only one application and it already did that, can you imagine with regular use?",5,79,B00SNM5US4
"Olaplex is only a silicone bonding agent! There’s nothing miraculous or special about it!! Silicones are like glass and is like a temporary bandaid for your hair. Olaplex just causes silicones to bind to your hair so it seems like it’s repairing the hair but it is not! Does silicone repair your hair? No, so Olaplex just causes silicones to cling to your damaged spots...",1,71,B00SNM5US4
"Just bleached my hair pale ash blonde from a virgin level 2 black. Only shampoo once or twice a month, no or VERY rare heat, hair masks in lieu of washing about once a week. So my hair started out pretty healthy and stayed pretty healthy through the bleaching and toning but it got a bit dry on the ends.

I used it after bleaching and before toning. I’ve only used it once but have also been doing hair oil treatments and some other hair masks I’ve never used before through the whole ordeal so it’s hard to pinpoint what helped most. I’ll update after a few weeks of use but whatever the cause, my hair is 99% back to its former glory (1% taken off because it’s got way more volume now which I’m assuming is due to some inevitable damage that I cannot feel with my fingers) even after 3 bleaching processes with 30 volume and one toning session with 20 volume. If you’ve already got unhealthy hair and you don’t take care of it, I doubt it’ll help you but it will probably help maintain healthy hair through something like bleaching.
Note: I gave it 5 stars because it’s worth investing in but ideally I’d knock off a star because the bottle is so small (expected this. added carmex to a picture for scale) and you have to use so much even for a guy like me with shortish hair. Just not cost effective enough for me to buy it more than once seeing as I take good care of my hair.",5,64,B00SNM5US4
"MAGIC!!!! I swear this stuff is made from Unicorns. I was doubtful, given that I have tried the gamut of hair conditioning treatments (yes, yes, I know this is NOT a conditioner, but a bonder) and all I have to say is WOWZA! After some really harsh processing (got my hair from dark dark brown to very very blonde so I could add funky colors (currently pink), my hair more closely resembled hay than it did actual hair and as the weeks went on, the breakage started getting worse. I tried this at my last feeble attempt to salvage my locks after a friend recommended it and I am BLOWN AWAY by the results! It really does work. I won't lie and tell you my hair is back to it's normal state, but it is SIGNIFICANTLY improved. It is smoother, softer, and even has some of the weight back! This was just after 1 application (I left it in for an hour as the website suggested for my level of damage). I can't wait to see if it gets better with the next application. I am definitely sold.",5,62,B00SNM5US4
I purchased Olaplex after reading tons of both positive and negative reviews. What I learned: 1) You must was your hair with a clarifying shampoo prior to using Olaplex 3. The chemical bonds can’t reconnect if your hair has build up from product or hard water. 2) Olaplex needs to be washed out of your hair with a clarifying shampoo. 3). Olaplex is not a conditioner so it will not hydrate your hair. If you have dry damaged hair you must apply a conditioner after using Olaplex. If you follow these three steps you should have a successful outcome. I’m 48 years old and have been bleaching my hair since high school (30 years). I am pleased that my natural waves have returned and the frizz is gone after using Olaplex 👍,5,52,B00SNM5US4
"But... 1 had used my bottle twice and my hair did take to bleaching much better. Now saying that.... it didnt make my hair shiny or bouncy or moisturized as it just helps to protect the hair in between or after a bleach process. This is NOT a conditioner or miracle mask. If your hair was dry before... it will be dry afterwards that is why I would suggest (and instructions say) a deep conditioner after you wash out this formula.

What I did try was the overnight process. Seemed silly. I'm a level 2 color and processed to a level 9. over the course of 4 years I have bleached and colored and removed color to add color and strip color and bleach some more, etc. I'm a bleach b. Cant help it. I'm also a 3A/B hair texture... half black and Asian. By year 4.... i had stopped going to the salon which uses olaplex 1 and 2 in my hair (which explains why I was able to bleach and dye my hair so much with barely any damage at all). ... and I would say 98% of ends are breaking off... i had cut about 4 inches of hair off and i still see i need to cut another 4!

I pulled out my olaplex and said what the heck and kept it on overnight with my heating cap on. Wash it out the next day and deep conditioned.

I used my regular oil and heat protectant, blow dry on cool setting and flat ironed my hair (which I stopped doing for a week) and my split ends literally looked like they disappeared! I wish I did a before and after. Much better results than just leaving it on for 10 minutes (which helped but I got an even better result leaving it on overnight). My hair looks healthy and it actually feels stronger. Yu have to personalize what you use after using this product to get the best results.

Really good stuff!

UPDATE: uploaded a few pictures of the changes in hair color I go through.. my hair has remained long and strong using olaplex. Its incredible how often I can change my color now.",5,73,B00SNM5US4
"This product is “meh” at best. I have a head of fully highlighted every 6 weeks long blonde hair. It’s naturally wavy/straight. I washed my hair, towel dried it, and applied this. I’d leave it in anywhere from 2-8 hours. I even had my hairstylist just put this in instead of blowing it dry, to try and save my hair from damage. Honestly, I noticed zero difference. If anything it’s maybe slightly worse off, a little more coarse. I’ve tried 3 bottles of it now, using it once or twice a week. I really wanted to give it a solid try. The one star is because it’s a good “detangler”. When you put it in your wet hair it becomes very silky(then you wash it out and your hair is back to it’s no noticeable repair state). If you have a little girl with lots of tangles and a sensitive scalp.. I’d use it for the purpose of brushing them out. Other than that plain old coconut oil left in as a hairmask delivers better results... so save your money, and don’t buy into all the hype(I sooo wanted to believe the hype). I’m zero percent less damaged and $80 dollars out.",1,54,B00SNM5US4
Excelente producto lo he usado desde hace 4 años vale la pena pagar el precio mi cabello es rubio y jamás se maltrata ni con la plancha se lo he recomendado a varias amigas y quedan igual de impresionadas que yo con los resultados restaura completamente las puntas abiertas y maltratadas por la decoloración,5,41,B00SNM5US4
"I bought Olaplex no 3 from Amazon a few years ago and it was alright. I probably washed it off too early.

Since I bleached my hair recently, I wanted to get hair treatment products such as this to prevent further damage.
I bought it from Amazon again and let it sit on my hair for good 30min (few days before bleaching, bottom half had some bleached and dyed hair). I think it made my hair a little softer but not a miraculous result.

I'll be using this more often on my bleached hair and come back to update my review.

By the way, I saw so many reviews saying that this is not authentic here on Amazon and so I ordered the same thing from Sephora to see the consistency and the packaging. The only difference (very subtle) I see is that:
the label sticker on Olaplex no 3 from Amazon is not smooth and has that vertical fold/crack going down caused by the bottle shape beneath it. The bottle from Sephora looks exactly the same and the code is the same on the Amazon one but the sticker label on the Sephora one is smooth.

I looked in close on both bottles and the Amazon's bottle is not completely smoothed out where the halves (the bottle is plastic and it's obviously made from sticking two halves together) meet are not sanded smoothly so the vertical center line sticking out causes the sticker to crease.
The one from SEPHORA though also has that verticle line in the center but it looks like it's smoothed out really well or something so while you can see the line, the surface is really smooth = no crease on the label sticker.

Other than that, the consistency of the product, the fragrance, the stickers, prints, fonts, quality are exactly the same.

I think it's important to get these from Amazon and make sure it's not sent from other sellers.",4,32,B00SNM5US4
Amazing. It's literally the best thing I've used for my hair. I have silver hair so I mix in my pravana silver with it and leave it in overnight. My hair was a level 6 and I had to lighten to a 10 almost 11 to get my hair this color and I've lightened close to half a dozen times. My hair has never felt better.,5,306,B00SNM5US4
"This left my hair very dry. I’ve read a lot of good things about this and had very high expectations but to my dismay, it did not deliver. My hair is very fine and thin and going through a bleaching process to go blond. I was looking for something restorative and conditioning and it didn’t deliver. I felt like the price for the amount was also a ripoff. I found a sample packet, at Walmart of all places, of this stuff called Hi•Pro•Pac Color Treated & Highlighted Hair Defense and it works AMAZING. And the packet was only like 2.00. Hello win.",1,27,B00SNM5US4
"Yes, it is worth it! This really works, and has done wonders for my hair. I went to the salon and they overprocessed my hair to the point of frying it. I have used this product twice to fix the damage. I still add my normal products after shampooing & conditioning, and find they penetrate better. My ends still look dry (albeit less so), so I still add oil to them every night. However, when I wake, I cannot help but be satisfied that my hair looks like hair and not hay.
***I would recommend watching a YouTube video on how to use this. It is expensive and you don’t want to incorrectly use it or waste the product. Stephanie Nicole has a good segment on how to use this properly and not waste the product (Just google her name and Olaplex). I have tons of product left after using this twice, much more than what even Olaplex indicates and my hair looks incredible.
My hair type: Super fine.",5,24,B00SNM5US4

"My hair is pretty healthy; I endured a full set of highlights bimonthly for about 15 years, so my ends aren't fantastic, but I haven't color processed in almost a year and have been taking Nutrafol for 4 months, so the first 6-8in of my roots is about as good as it gets. I ordered this product as a Prime Day deal because I had been eyeballing it for a while with the idea that it would bring my bleach damaged ends back to life until they were finally all chopped off, and I gave it a good 3 weeks of exclusive use to see if maybe there's an adjustment period, but I'm convinced that this product is just not meant for people with fine hair (or oil glands). In the first week or so my hair started falling out waaaaaay more than usual; I would end up with a handful every time I washed (falling out from the root, not breaking off where the bleach damage was). I've had issues with excess oil since giving birth about a year and a half ago, but this made it so much worse! I wash my hair in the morning, and usually could go a day in between if I threw it up in a bun, but while using the Olaplex system I would have to put my hair up before I even left work for the day; if I had plans in the evening I would have to go home and wash my hair beforehand because it would bee too dirty to go out after an 8-10hr day, even hidden away in a clip. The No 4 shampoo and No 5 conditioner smell great, and the first few hours of the day my hair felt nice and had good body, but after lunch it's all downhill. The No 3 treatment is what caused the most fallout in my opinion, and the No 6 bond smoother leave-in made it feel tacky and tangle easily. After my month trial run I decided to switch back to my beloved patchouli CannaCell shampoo and conditioner, and I am so much happier at a quarter of the price! Now to focus on regrowing what this garbage stole from me :(",1,15,B00SNM5US4
"I've been using Redkins PH-Bonder treatment for a few weeks and decided to give this a try. My hair was pretty broken after my last bleaching/toning. After one use, waiting until my hair was completely dry, I noticed that the texture of my hair appeared dryer than it did before. I found that the Redkin product works much better and it's WAY less expensive. Hair feels much silkier with the Redkin product.",2,26,B00SNM5US4

"***Caution*** this is not salon quality. I did not notice until it was too late. If you look in the top left corner this is labeled “take home”, you want to find one labeled “professional use only”. Also this seller does not accept returns :(",1,24,B00SNM5US4
"Middle aged women who has been lightening (ok, bleaching) her hair for decades also blow drying and curling iron. Had a short round of chemotherapy 3 years ago and my hair was DEAD. Completely brittle and split ends, it didn't even look like hair anymore. I was about to give up on trying to grow it out to pony tail length and thought I'd give this product a try as a last ditch effort.
I'm a skeptic, but honestly after one use my hair looks fantastic (stranger compliments fantastic). I am currently pretending that my hair is in a bob hairstyle and I like my hair FLUFFY so when I hear 'this product makes my hair so silky' I hear 'flat'. Not the case with this product, my hair look healthy and had so much body. If this is what one use does- I'm a believer.

Follow Up after 2 months: Still love this product. I have done 3 treatment now and my hair looks fantastic. Healthy, shiny and fluffy- no more dead hair. I have barely used a quarter of the bottle, so one bottle lasts quite awhile. I'll make it to shoulder length now.",5,13,B00SNM5US4

 See my video for a walkthrough from start to finish. To start, my color treated naturally frizzy hair was not damaged, just dry with the ends feeling rough and especially dry despite fancy deep conditioners. I’m growing my hair out To donate again so I won’t Be getting many trims. The ends needed help because they were heading to splitsville if I didn’t do something.

Summary is that the Olaplex softened and moisturized my hair and made it feel quite a bit thicker when I run my hands through it. The thicker feeling hair is nice because my husband likes to run his hands through my hair and likes when it feels fuller, which has been difficult since going through menopause. Olaplex is not a miracle to transform hair texture or type. I have naturally fine and frizzy hair. While it helped with the dryness, it did not transform my naturally frizzy hair. I will have to continue my search for the frizz cure.

In before and after pics, the before are on the left.

Overall, I like this product, but I don't like the price, so it loses a star. It is very expensive and unless continued and repeated use has a compounding effect, I don't think I will purchase this again.",,10,B00SNM5US4
"My daughter is very into all of her instagram beauty gurus , and one of her favorites has been using this product. She also wants to try all the different colored hair dyes they use. She has dark dark brown hair , so she’s had to bleach her hair a few times . We went to a salon and had an Olaplex treatment and were amazed by how soft and healthy her super damaged hair looked and felt. This isn’t the entire treatment that you get in a salon, it’s the product to use at home to maintain the treatment , or skip the treatment and use on its own. I recently had most of my really long , dark brown hair bleached and colored and I could barely comb through my hair. I thought I was going to have to cut a lot of it off. I bought this to see if I could salavage my hair . Without having the salon treatment , just using this on my own , my hair was super soft and silky ! Even healthier than before I bleached it. I have to use it two to three times a week to maintain the perfect smoothness , but I only used it once this week and my hair still looks pretty good .",5,13,B00SNM5US4
"I love this stuff! I've got overprocessed hair and wish I had started using this stuff sooner. It brought my curls back to life after just one use.

"Works wonders on my hair. My hair has been very dry and damaged from too much straightening and curling from hot tools and my ends were starting to look terrible. To be honest, I have thin hair, do not get hair cuts often, and I blow dry and straighten or curl my hair almost every single day so my hair goes through a lot on a daily basis. I heard about this product from a relative who is a hair stylist and she said she uses it often and it is amazing for your hair. I used it for the first time a few days ago but I did not have much time to keep it on for very long so I left it on around 15-20 mins and after blow drying my hair it looked much healthier. My hair was silky and soft with less visible damage and that was only after 1 use. I am very positive it will only get better the more I use it and the longer I keep in on my hair if it worked well after only one 15 min use.",5,14,B00SNM5US4
"There are two common reviews that I want to address. 1st, that the product is damaging their hair. If you need Olaplex, your hair is already damaged. You hair is falling out and breaking because you bleached it. Olaplex is amazing but it isnt going to glue your hair back together. What it will do is bond your hair that hasnt yet reached the point of breaking and it will help but some hair cannot be helped. 2nd is that the product is too expensive for what you get. (sigh) So here is the deal, You tried to bleach your own hair because you thought it would be soooo much cheaper. Your hair is burned and falling apart so now you want to find a cheap way to fix your hair. (sigh) Insert Brand Mondo rolling his eyes. Good product costs money honey. You are welcome to get something cheaper but remember that you get what you pay for.",5,8,B00SNM5US4
"I’ve had olaplex before in my salon after a lightening treatment, so after my latest bleaching, I decided to purchase an olaplex product. My hair was finally long and healthy and I thought it could handle a lightening for summer. I was really upset to find my hair was suddenly dry and frizzy and felt like straw. I was a little hesitant buying this product from Amazon as opposed to the actual website, but after reading mostly good reviews, I figured I would try it out. I was also leaning towards buying it here since, as a prime member, I got free ONE DAY shipping. My package came the next day and I was a little skeptical. My package looked as though it had been opened a bit and there was no packing slip. But the bottle looked okay and still had the tamper-proof seal so I decided to try it out. I could tell it was the real deal almost instantly. My hair felt soooo much better even before I dried it! Really happy I decided to ignore the few reviews on here that claimed the product was fake since it definitly isn’t!! Will absolutely buy again when I run out!!",5,16,B00SNM5US4
"THIS IS NOT A CONDITIONER. If you still think this product is a conditioner or expect it to perform like one, stop reading. I have been getting my hair done professionally since 2008 and am very conscientious/knowledgeable about hair products/processes. I hadn't been able to find a hair stylist who is multi-talented (past typical hair color/balayage knowledge) and have been to 5 different stylists since May. I went to a different hair stylist for a full set of highlights 1 week after getting color/balayage done that was not done how I asked. The salon does not have Olaplex or any conditioning treatments, so my hair was subjected to 100% bleach. It looked and felt fried. My hair was no where near what I was looking for, so I booked with yet a different stylist for a new full set of highlights, color etc. I knew if I didn't do something to condition my hair before then that it would not tolerate any more chemicals without breaking off. I used the Olaplex 3 for 3 days straight. I left it on for 4 hours then washed with Amika Normacore shampoo followed by Marc Anthony Damage Repair Mask. My hair looked and felt incredible. My stylist confirmed that whatever I did helped and that it allowed her to spend 6 hours on my hair. I would recommend Olaplex 3 to anyone with severely damaged hair from lightening/chemical treatments. I would not use it more than 3 times per week as too much protein will cause damage.",5,6,B00SNM5US4
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Ok let me start by saying, what happened to my hair is the horror story they give you at the salon about why NOT TO bleach your own hair at home.
I had GORGEOUS hair. For reals! It was long and thick and healthy and full and big and beautiful.
And it was red. Which i had dyed it consistently for a year. I decided (got a bug up my butt) i wanted to go back to my natural blonde. Que horror flick music.
End result was hair so damaged i had to cut it all off including shaving off the back into an undercut to eliminate the severe damage.
My goal for the last 4 months has been to avoid getting it wet, avoid washing it, and keep it moisturized at all costs!
I bought this as a hail mary. My hair has reached the state of non stop breakage. Ive got 2 inch long bangs. I did not cut these hairs. They broke off. Seriously.
I wasnt expecting a miracle. I just wanted to touch my hair without it breaking instantly.
I got what i wanted, after one application.
I can run my hands through it and its NOT BREAKING!
THATS INCREDIBLE!!
I plan to use it 2-3x/week as recommended for seriously damaged hair.
Im very happy!

& yes the bottle is small. Its 3.3 ounces. Thats small. But i have very thick hair and when you apply it to towel dried hair it spreads like crazy because its super creamy.
I barely used any in my first application and i made sure it was on ALL the damage. Double the amount in front!
I expect that my results will only improve with continued use.
I wish i could afford the shampoo and conditioner. Alas, not this pay period! Mortgage and such! 😂😂
So my suggestion is......
BUY IT!",5,6,B00SNM5US4
"My hair's color treated and it's only slightly damaged and of course super dry. my hair is pretty long and after saturating my hair with it HALF the bottle was gone and I was ok with that because that's what happens when you have long hair. After leaving it on my hair for 1.5-2 hours I shampooed and conditioned as usual and blow-dried my hair but I have not noticed any change, difference whatsoever. A 14$ treatment (since half of the bottle's gone after one use) and NO change at all?! that's very disappointing. I'll be doing the process one more time next week and update if I see any difference after 2 times use. Bottom line: it's a very expensive treatment and not really worth it. I DO NOT RECOMMEND it unless you have money to burn or you're bored!",1,10,B00SNM5US4
"Nothing short of a miracle product! I went to a stylist to dye and color my hair (no, not box dye!)...something I usually do myself but thought I deserved a treat! Anyway, many friends go to her, I’ve seen her work so trusted her. She knew most of my hair was already bleached under the fading pink. Turns out she used a 40vol bleach, leaving it on too long as well. I never use anything over 20. My virgin roots went from near black to a light blonde so quickly...I said “woah, how’d that happen so quick!” And asked her about the volume she used.
Anyway, now i know what that “straw like”
Hair is I’ve heard people refer to. Now I know extreme brittle and extreme breakage.
It’s never been so damaged in my life ... started treating it with various products that helped some but not much. A friend recommended this, I trusted her and , omg. I’ve only used it once, leaving it on for about 2.5 hours...and my hair already feels like hair again. Still damaged of course, but hair, not straw!! Can’t wait to use it again! My hair is saved!!!
——It’s legit (a stylist friend of a friend told me
that i COULD buy the real thing (as offered on their website) off amazon...but to be sure amazon was the distributor)
—-Worth every penny
—-Is the best product for damaged hair I’ve ever used (and I’ve used almost all of them— all salon grade, expensive, well known quality brands ).
I seriously want to write them a thank you letter.",5,10,B00SNM5US4
"This product is a bit of bother to use, so you really want it to work. I tried it 2x as I always run 2 experiments. Both times it totally straightened my short fine wavy hair. I use curly girl techniques/products to enhance my curliness, so straight was not the desirable result. It lasted a week in each case and I had to work to get it curly again. It was softer, smoother, ""younger"" looking hair. I think it would be great on long straight hair. Or perhaps tightly curly hair that does not straighten so easily. The first time I only left it on the recommended 10 minutes. The next time after watching a few videos I applied a more generous amount and left it on 30 minutes. Same result... Straight Hair! It DOES remove frizz, that's for sure.",3,7,B00SNM5US4
"1st & foremost , This olaplex NO3 is the EXACT olaplex NO3 I purchased from a sephora store on vacation in Las Vegas✔ The bottle DID have a seal on it✔ & the fragrance & the consistency is the EXACT same IF NOT actually a bit more potent (& I'm not sure if that may be the case because of the Vegas heat/traveling etc) BUT this is a 👍 thumbs up! I was WORRIED due to other reviews BUT PERSONALLY this was great. ALSO AS A HAIRDRESSER Myself OLAPLEX NO3 is NOT a miracle product, it's ALSO NOT A CONDITIONER is a BOND REPAIR, which pretty much puts a so called ""coating"" on the hair while moisturizing, to keep the hair STRONG when styling to prevent FURTHER breakage , Split ends etc.... it ALSO adds SIGNIFICANT Healthier Hair Luster and Shine. But the KEY to this product working is **READ DIRECTIONS** you HAVE TO leave this in your hair for about 10 mins or longer AND THEN SHAMPOO/CONDITION your hair, its TRULY amazing of the Significant shine✔ movement✔ , Bounce✔ if seen after doing this treatment on MY hair, AS WELL as Human Hair Extensions/Human hair Wigs (which is of course longer hair!) & REALLY made the hair AFTER letting it Air dry &/or blow drying/styling LOOK AND FEEL BEAUTIFUL & pretty much REVIVED. Is it permanent? NO, but just RE Treat your hair! No product IN THIS WORLD ""gets rid of split ends"" BESIDES A SCISSOR Trimming them off! Your hair will be revived with protein and using a decent shampoo (I personally use Schwarzkopf Gliss Fiber Therapy Shampoo) and a VERY NICE Conditioner (I either use NEXXUS OR Schwarzkopf Gliss Conditioner) AND AFTER doing the entire process CORRECTLY, it is Significant difference... some people may look for a BRAND NEW head of hair, NO! But it DEFINITELY REVIVES and you will not regret it! Just use it CORRECTLY and ONCE A WEEK! You will not regret it!",5,5,B00SNM5US4
To say I am shocked and upset about the size of this product and what I paid for it is insane!! ($30.00) Had a realized the bottle would be microscopic I would have not purchased it. For the price point it should have been a much larger bottle. This product better make my hair as soft as a baby’s ass for the amount I just dropped on this.,1,14,B00SNM5US4
"If you bleach your hair to make it blonde, you simply must use olaplex because it justnplaun works. Bleaching strips each hair shaft, makes it thinner, brittle and dry. Olaplex number three helps build it back up, repairing weak spots. You end up with hair that almost feels as if you hadn't bleached it. Your hair is stringer and sleeker again, instead of ""fried"". I remember long ago Kim Kardashian saidnshe leaves it on under a shower cap overnight and washes it off in the morning. I tried that and the sound of the shower cap woke me up too much and was coming off and messy. So now I just put it on generously and out it all up in a clip for several hours as I hang out around the house and wash it out, condition and air dry. I love this stuff and have bought it many times now. I have sort of long and thick hair- so I get three treatments out of one of these little bottles. It is so worth every penny for me. P.s. it does not add moisture to hair, but rather adds proteins etc to build and heal hair.",5,6,B00SNM5US4
"I’ve seen several people say “This isn’t a fake, I compared the real one to Amazon’s and they look exactly the same.” If people ACTUALLY did that, they would notice that the ingredients list from Olaplex’s site compared to Amazon’s “Olaplex’s No 3” IS VERY DIFFERENT. I didn’t realize this (because of the 50,000+ reviews with an average of 4.5 stars, I just purchased it without comparing first) at first. Then I used it and it didn’t live up to the hype. So I did some digging.

Olaplex’s Site Ingredients List:
Water, Bis-Aminopropyl Diglycol Dimaleate, Propylene Glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Glycerin, Hydroxyethyl Ethylcellulose, Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Quaternium-91, Sodium Benzoate, Cetrimonium Methosulfate, Cetrimonium Chloride, Fragrance, Polyquaternium-37, Tetrasodium EDTA, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Etidronic Acid, Ascorbic Acid, Phytantriol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Panthenol, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Citric Acid, Potassium Sorbate.

Amazon’s “Olaplex No 3 Ingredients List:
Water, Bis-Aminopropyl Digycol Dimaleate, Propylene Glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Retinol Palmitate (Vitamin A), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Phytantriol, Panthenol, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Wheat Amino Acids, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Hydroxyethyl Ethylcellulose, Quaternium-91, Cetrimonium Methosulfate, Cetrimonium Chloride, Fragrance (Parfum), Polyquaternium-37, Tetrasodium EDTA, Magnesium Nitrate, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Magnesium Chloride, Methylisothiazolinone, Etidronic Acid, Potassium Sorbate, Phenoxyethanol, Citric Acid, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Benzoate, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil.

The ingredients list isn’t even close to the same. If you want genuine Olaplex, get on their site and find an authorized distributor or buy it directly from their website. Very disappointed!!",2,3,B00SNM5US4
"First of all, let me start of by saying if you receive a product without a safety seal, or you are familiar with Olaplex and the product just doesn't seem ""right,"" definitely send it back. Amazon gets it's products from MULTIPLE distributors, so unfortunately there is sometimes a (small) chance of getting a fake product. However, that being said I am pretty familiar with Olaplex, and the product I received was 100 percent authentic.

I had made the mistake of being super impatient with my hair coloring process and did wayyy too much in a very short amount of time. My poor hair was NOT happy. It looked frazzled, poofy, and my color looked uneven/patchy and dull. I was afraid I would have to do a professional keratin treatment to get it to look healthy and shiny again.

I had not done an Olaplex treatment in a pretty long time, and certainly hadn't done it on hair that had been pretty significantly damaged. I decided to give my hair a few days break and ordered Olaplex 3 off amazon. When it arrived I had put so many products in my hair to keep it tame, that I knew I needed to shampoo it first. I put the Olaplex on towel dried hair (thoroughly saturated the strands) and let it sit for 90 minutes.

I shampooed my hair again with sulfate free shampoo the second time around, and then deep conditioned my hair for 20 minutes. While I was rinsing my hair, I could already tell that it fell so much better. After I styled my hair I was amazed. My hair was 95% better after just one use! I would have been surprised to see it even 70% better. This stuff is now my holy grail hair product. The more you use it, the more it is supposed to mend the hair. I can't wait to see what it looks like after a couple of more washes!

My hair is shiny, the color looks even and professionally done since it corrected the dry patchy areas, and it feels so silky. I didn't have to do a 4 hour keratin treatment and kill my naturally curly hair for several months. My hair looks awesome and I feel like the price of this product is 100% worth it. You just need to make sure you are using it correctly. It is NOT a conditioner, it is a treatment that repairs the bonds in your hair. You still have to shampoo the product out and condition after. I highly recommend this product!",5,4,B00SNM5US4
No seal on the product! I bought this in at the end of April received it may and had a salon treatment so I haven't used this product my fault for not looking at the bottle right away! it is now the beginning of August and I wanted to use the at home product since my hair is now feeling very dry from the summer sun and heat styling ! Well low and behold I went to open and realized that the bottle does not have a seal! I do not feel comfortable using this product since it is not sealed and i am well past my return window. :(,1,14,B00SNM5US4
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 I always recommend this product to my other friends who bleach their hair. My hair is extremely damaged and all of Plex save my hair. The only thing I don’t like is that Ola Plex doesn’t come with a very large bottle. It is a little bit expensive and you don’t get that much. I wish we could have a little bit more for the money we spend on it. However I do really like this product and I have recommended it to two of my friends this week.",5,9,B00SNM5US4
"My hair has been incredibly dry and brittle for years. I’ve tried everything!!! I’ve even changed medications as my hair stylist said that could be the problem. Diet, supplements, treatments, masks, you name it. I was about to give up. My hair is incredibly damaged and I started to think I would be doomed with this hay for the rest of my life. I read reviews of this product and I thought, why not?

I honestly am still shocked at how well this works. Even professional treatments have not had this kind of impact. After 3 uses I saw a dramatic shift in my hair. I can’t wait to continue using it more regularly to see the full results. If you’re over 25 with very damaged hair, just try it!",5,10,B00SNM5US4
"THIS product is NOT the REAL Olaplex! I just finished a bottle up from the salon and when this one arrived at my house I compared the ingredient label.(I’ve used Olaplex on and off since 2015) This is different. It smells and feels different. The instructions are different also. However, it still contained the main bonding ingredient so I decided to try it. It made my hair feel worse and some broke off! I tried to save a few dollars and it was not worth it! Just order it directly from the company and don’t be out your $28. I want my money and my hair back! >=(",1,12,B00SNM5US4
"whenever i go get my hair done, my hairstylist always uses an olaplex treatment for my hair and i always leave the salon with the smoothest and silkiest hair even though i’ve been dyeing it for years! i saw that they sold a mini version on amazon and i was so excited to purchase it. after just one use, i noticed my shower drain was completely clogged and the amount of hair i found was alarming. i then proceeded to dry my hair and comb it and i was left with another alarming amount of hair. i’m so scared all my hair is going to eventually fall out. i cant even run my fingers through my hair without at least a strand coming out. my hair feels so thin now and it didn’t even make a difference. my hair feels softer when i use conditioner. i am so mad!!!",1,8,B00SNM5US4
"With *REPEATED* use, yes there does seem to be some improvement. I think it's fair to say that each person's experience is going to differ from other's. My experience is with recent excessive hair processes, my hair became very badly damaged. I began using Olaplex again after taking a long break and with repeated use, there is an increase in some shine, less burn frizz, less sticking out dry pieces, overall less brillo looking hair and more a return to healthier looking hair. No miracles, but with repeated usage (so far about 3 weeks) there is a noticeable difference. My hair first felt better, then slowly began to look better. I'm using it not as instructed, but every time I wash my hair I mix it with a deep conditioner and leave it on in the shower for as long as I can (5-10 mins) during my morning shower. I just don't have the luxury of time to follow the instructions as-is. Nonetheless, with consistency, I do see an improvement. I'm glad I got it. I did hope for better, but it is improving the quality of the hair to a degree which honestly was badly damaged. I recommend but will say, there's just been no magic wand for me with this. If my schedule was different and I could follow the instructions to a T, then maybe it would be closer to a miracle, but since this isn't possible at this time, I'm pretty happy.",4,4,B00SNM5US4
"A friend recommended this product after my Aveda colorist did a balayage treatment on me for the first time. I have (or should I say HAD) long thick blonde hair. I used the product twice and started to notice a tremendous amount of breakage. I went back to my salon on Friday to address the problem and he asked me whether I was using this product (by name) and when I said ""yes"" he gathered his employees around me to demonstrate what happens when a color-treated blonde uses this product. They've had a number of clients have the same problem so he told me to throw the product out immediately. I was at the salon for 4 hours, and to avoid cutting my hair into a chin-length bob - I have to avoid blowdrying or flat ironing my hair for the next 3 months. I wash my hair twice a week, and let it air dry whenever possible. This is ridiculous. I look like I have a birds nest in the back of my head. Can't return it to Amazon (window expired) so now I'm throwing it away. Unreal.",1,6,B00SNM5US4

"First of all, I was nervous about possibly receiving a knock-off product. I believe that what I received is genuine, based on the results I have gotten thus far.

I ordered this after I severely damaged my hair through bleaching. Certain sections of my hair literally felt like gum. I knew if I combed through those sections, the hair would literally break right off, and some of it did!. I panicked but did some research and ordered this product. I read other reviews/instructions and here is how I used it.

1. Wash your hair very gently (because it is already presumably damaged, like mine was) to get rid of any product build-up and oil. The olaplex needs to be able to penetrate the hair, so your hair should have NO PRODUCT of any kind in it when you apply the olaplex. If your hair is clean, just rinse it so that it is wet. Do not use conditioner, leave-in conditioner, or any oils. Just wash it and rinse out the soap with water. (My hair is already so damaged that I don't like the idea of washing before AND after, but it is necessary with this product. So when I wash before applying the olaplex, I will wet my hair in the shower, apply a little sulfate-free natural type shampoo onto the actual hair--whereas when I usually wash, I concentrate on the scalp and just let the suds fall down the length of the hair--and gentle suds the product, then rinse with water. I do this to just get the build-up off because when I rinse out the olaplex, I will wash it properly and I do not apply any olaplex directly on my scalp or roots. This is just another step I take to try to preserve what hair health I have left.)
2. Towel dry very gently so that it is damp, not soaking.
3. Concentrate the product where you have the most damage. Once you have saturated those areas of your hair, put a little on the rest, and gently comb through.
4. Immediately put on a plastic shower cap to keep the product from drying out. Also, this helps use the natural heat from your body to (presumably) assist the olaplex in penetrating your hair.
5. Sleep on it! I leave it on for 12 hours at a time.
6. In the morning, rinse out the olaplex, wash your hair, and then use a good conditioner.

I did this twice, then did a variation where I did steps 1-6 above, but after applying the olaplex and before applying the shower cap, I also applied a hair mask over top, slept on it for about 11 hours, and finished up the steps as written above.

(This is my variation on getting the best results, so be sure to adapt this to what works best for you.)

The directions say to use this 2-3 times per week for severely damaged hair. I have used this three times so far and cannot believe the results. My hair is nowhere near 100% healthy, but the areas that felt gummy now either do not feel gummy at all, or are about 75% improved. I am pretty sure that if I did not purchase this, I would be sporting a pixie cut right now. I plan to continue using the olaplex 2-3 times per week and eventually drop the frequency when I feel my hair is healthy enough to do so.

I've read some reviews complaining about the cost of this product, and it is no doubt pricey. For me, it has been 100% worth it because my hair was literally about to fall off if the wind blew too hard. I am so grateful to have saved it. After 3 applications, I have barely made a dent in the product. I would estimate that I've used maybe 10% of the product? Maybe 15%. My hair would be categorized as long, it is past my shoulders by several inches (but not super long, like not down to my waist or anything.)

Other reviewers have pointed out that this is NOT a hair mask or deep conditioner, and it is not. My hair does appear shinier after using it, and it may be softer, but it is in a way that it feels healthier. Your hair will not feel like you just used a hair mask/deep conditioner. It will feel stronger, less frizzy, more manageable, and I have also noticed that what breakage I do have from the bleaching is not noticeable because those hairs are more weighed down (does that make sense?)

Overall, I am EXTREMELY happy with this purchase. I was skeptical, reading all of these reviews stating that this was THE MIRACLE product, but I am sold on it now. I will continue to use the product and update this review if needed. I would say that if your hair is severely damaged, the price is worth it, and the product does exactly what it claims to do.",5,3,B00SNM5US4
"I’ve always spend a fortune on my blonde hair, from Professional services to using high end products. My hair has always been in great condition, thanks to Pureology and Redken.

Believing the hype on here, I decided to take the plunge. From the 1st application, I instantly noticed a change in my hair and NOT a good one. “No way was my hair like butter” like someone on here mentioned. Again, based on the exaggerated reviews on here decided to use it again. OMG 😳 my hair became so weak it started to break. I kidd you not, THIS PRODUCT WILL DISINTEGRATE YOUR HAIR! I felt like if I was applying Sally Hansen Hair removal onto my hair. I wanted to cry as I saw my hair falling into the drain. I wish I can say that I’m magnifying, but no. My once beautiful hair is now ruined.

Do yourself a favor save your hair and money.
Do. Not. Buy. This.....Listen to the one star reviews on here, the ladies know what they are talking about.

If you really want hair like “butter” I suggest you buy Redken.",1,3,B00SNM5US4
I learned about this product a very long time ago when I wanted to bleach my hair. I wasn't sure if it would actually work or not despite seeing all the great reviews. I recently bleached my hair from a dark brown almost black to a honey blonde which looked great but absolutely dried out my hair. I knew I had to get my hands on a bottle of Olaplex to repair my hair somewhat. I was skeptical of ordering through amazon due to some people saying that amazon is not a licensed distributor. I don't know if this fact is true or not but the formula does work. I think it may be watered down though. One thing I must say is I saw it eliminated frizz which was an important factor for me. My hair is pretty thick and just a little frizzy still. I will definitely buy this again and continue to use it but purchase directly from Olaplex.,4,8,B00SNM5US4
Olaplex is a lifesaver for my hair. In the last 4 months I've had my hair bleached from almost black boxed hair dye to a blonde bayalage. Needless to say that caused a pretty decent amount of damage in my hair. I have used the olaplex system twice and it has done wonders for my hair. It looks so much more healthy and shiny now. It feels stronger. The number 3 is perfect for upkeep. Highly recommend for fellow bleach blondes.,5,18,B00SNM5US4
"What the HECK!?

I have very short bleach blonde hair and I bought this to help with bleach breakage. I followed the directions, applied it to damp hair thoroughly and decided to leave it on for an hour. As I'm rinsing my hair to prepare to shampoo clumps of my hair are falling out. I rinsed out the shampoo applied little conditioner and quickly got out of the shower. It's hair drying now but I can see that there is still hair falling out.

I've been obsessed about my bleach hair breaking and I wish I wasn't, because I would have never bought this product to begin with. I wanted to strengthen my hair but instead it, it broke it all off. I'm on the verge of tears and I'm afraid I'll have to cut my already short hair even shorter. Please do yourself a favor and stop obsessing and just condition your hair. I wish I had!",1,4,B00SNM5US4
"Get this immediately if your hair is damaged to the point where you're looking into this product! I wish I would have taken a photo of my very damaged & dry hair - it was rough, dry, brittle - embarrassing. I opted to get this instead of the shampoo & conditioner. Very glad, each small bottle is 28$. The Repairing Treatment lasted about a month, washing my hair once a week for that month (I usually wash my hair only once a week anyway).

The directions says to leave it in for 10 minutes - after I applied a good amount around 9pm, I covered my hair with plastic wrap, secured with a head band and washed it out the next morning, around 7am. My hair felt amazing! Like silk!!!

However - 2 days after the red ring around my head disappeared, I visited the drug store & bought some cheap, disposable, plastic hair covers that I used next time. They did not leave that red ring & I didn't have to hide for 2 days!

Olaplex is awesome, I wish it was less expensive - but it most definitely delivers! Order this ASAP!!",5,4,B00SNM5US4
"I'm freshly out of the shower after using Olaplex No. 3, 4, and 5 (shampoo and conditioner). In 2017, for the first time in my 54 years, I had crown breakage to the point of seeing my actual scalp! I hit YouTube and began to watch I don't even know how many hair tutorials on damaged relaxed hair, crown thinning, crown breakage, alopecia, going natural... Now I'm not one for just buying products because someone else raves about it, but along with starting to make my own DIY hair oils and protein treatments, I did purchase a few products that really did wonders for my hair. A main staple for life is Joico Moisture Recovery shampoo, conditioner, and treatment balm. But I do have some other faves (Shea Moisture Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil, and Herbal Essence Coconut Milk shampoo and conditioner). Once a month I also use Aphogee 2-step protein shampoo and conditioner, and after a relaxer (which I do my own), I would follow the 2-step system with the hardcore Aphogee protein treatment. November 2019, my hair was longer than it had ever been in my life. I've never had long hair, so when my hair began resting on my upper back, I was doing cartwheels! However, my crown was still an issue.

To try something new, I began watching tutorials on ayurvedic hair care. I purchased and mixed together some fantastic ayurvedic powders, which, had I used them as a treatment once in awhile, I'm sure my hair would have continued to thrive. BUT, I made the mistake of adding a nice heaping of the ayurvedic powder to my hair oil that I would put on my hair daily as a moisturizer. After washing, conditioning, and deep conditioning my hair one week after a relaxer, I took the towel off and looked like Bozo the Clown! My hair was straight but the ends were puff balls all the way around! My hair had never done that! PROTEIN OVERLOAD!! I was heartbroken! I gave myself a good trim, but for the next few weeks, hair was everywhere. My bathroom floor looked like a bear-skinned rug. Pieces of hair on the bathroom walls, sink, it was a mess! Unfortunately I had to deep trim my hair to remove all the damage, which meant cutting ALL of the length that I had grown. I still have decent length in the front, but I cut the back of my hair even with just above the nape of my neck. It's hair. It will grow back.

I had been hearing about Olaplex for a very long time and I figured, if there was a time to try it, now is the time. I let the No. 3 stay on my hair for 30 minutes. I used a small dollop of the Olaplex shampoo and OMG the LATHER! Could not believe it!! After using the Olaplex conditioner, I was hooked. After the conditioner, I loaded my hair with AsIAm Hydration Elation conditioner and oils. I'm sitting with a plastic cap and steam cap on while I write this review.

For those saying Olaplex made your hair feel rough or didn't work, well maybe that's true, or maybe you didn't follow up with a deep conditioning moisturizing conditioner afterwards. I know Olaplex is a bond-builder, not a protein treatment, but they both strengthen the hair. You have to replenish the moisture after this treatment or you may think it just left your hair rough. I'm now streamlining my wash routine to twice a week. The Olaplex system on the weekends, and the Joico system midweek. And while I'll continue to make my own incredible hair oil, that will be the extent of my DIY concoctions. I already know my hair is capable of growing strong and healthy, and 2 relaxers later, had I not damaged my hair, I wonder what length it would be right now. But, I'm on my way back, and Olaplex is now along for the journey!!",5,2,B00SNM5US4
Love olaplex. It helps moisturize my hair that has been damaged from bleach and heat. I highly recommend using this product a couple times a week to see real results,5,12,B00SNM5US4
"This is moisturizing and works okay for dead or split ends, I’ve noticed my ends looking much healthier. It has a nice scent and isn’t overpowering, it just smells like salon shampoo! I will say it is a very small amount of the product for the price. I have been able to make it last longer by pairing it with other products after the first few uses. I have used it 4 times and have about 1/3 of the bottle left (that’s just with me applying this to my ends and then gently distributing it upwards) so it doesn't last long. I don’t think I will be reordering this because of the small amount you get for the price, I just don’t feel like it made my hair grow or stay hydrated as well as it should. Overall it’s a good product and did moisturize but just not the results I am looking for in that price range.",3,2,B00SNM5US4
"I used this for the first time yesterday, slept with it in my hair and woke up this morning and washed it out. I can't believe how much better my hair looks and feels after the first use! I went from brown to platinum really fast and fried the heck out of my hair. My hair is still breaking a little but nothing like it was before I used this. I would have broken hairs all over my shoulders by the end of the day... no more! I can't wait to use this again! I will add an update after a few more uses with photos!",5,20,B00SNM5US4
"I see that there are many positive reviews for this product, but also several negative reviews. My experience was negative. I started off with some dryness. I was hoping this product would give me a smoother, silkier look like in some of the photos. I've been lightening my hair for quite some time and touch up my roots every few weeks (I haven't dyed the length of my hair for a long time.) I started using this once a week letting it sit on my damp hair for about 20 minutes before washing, deep conditioning and drying/styling as usual. At first I thought it looked like it was making some small improvements. And then…. my hair started breaking off. I was in denial about it being the Olaplaex so I kept using it. And things got worse. Now I have a 3-4"" layer of broken off hair on the top layer. It looks awful. It's so obvious… I can't hide it unless I wear my hair up (difficult since my hair isn't very long.) I cannot believe the breakage and damage this product has caused. I figured the negative reviews were nonsense since there were so many positive reviews. I think this can work for some, but for others it fries their hair off and causes irreversible damage. In my opinion, it's not worth taking the gamble unless you're okay with all of your hair breaking off. Maybe it'll work well for you. Maybe you'll end up with a fried mullet.",1,2,B00SNM5US4
"i WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS TREATMENT FOR ANY HAIR TYPE EXCEPT THICK, VERY STRONG HAIR. It has been 24 hours since using this treatment. I left it on the maximum amount of time. Disclaimer: I have super fine, super thin, very very straight hair damaged over time by perms and color, neither of which, at age 75 I'm likely to stop doing, lol. So, that said, this product did leave my hair soft. VERY soft which, given the thin, fine, straight nature of my hair, isn't as wonderful as it would seem. My hair does feel very soft but soft do not compensate for it being FRIZZY or flyaway, which my hair still is DESPITE using Pur'ador cream rinse especially FOR thin, dry, permed hair. Also despite my very tight, curly perm, here's absolutely NO body left in the curls. Imagine perming a 3 year old kid's hair and that's about what I have. On the PLUS side my hair does feel wonderfully soft and looks shiny so if you have no other issues except dry hair it's worth a try. But if you're looking for a salon conditioning result....not sure you'll be happy and at THIS PRICE, HAPPY should be a minimum result.",2,One,B00SNM5US4
"Smells really good & a little goes a long way. I’m a Caucasian female with very short, very kinky, curly hair that’s dry & frizzy. I bought all 7 products as recommended on Olaplex’s website. $168. Followed all directions carefully & was so disappointed. It did nothing for my hair & I mean nothing. I tried again using just the #3 everyone raves about, then the shampoo & conditioner. Nothing. If anything it was worse. I wanted this for so long & saved to get it. $168 wasted. Really mad at myself & I should have known better. If it sounds to good to be true....it probably is.",2,2,B00SNM5US4
"I purchased this because a hair dresser friend of mine said it was what they recommended to their clients when they dye their hair (usually blonde). It helps bond the hairs back together to give it strength. I don't bleach my hair, but I do color it every few months. My hair was healthy when I was younger, but having a medical issues, my hair started to fall out and doesn't grow like it used to. The ends are split and it is usually semi-course. After using this just once, I could run my fingers through my hair and not feel the rough parts. It felt almost silky. I've used it about 3 times and still have half the bottle left. I cannot say if it repairs split ends (I know you cannot mend them back together), I mean more in the way of helping them not fray or split further...but I definitely recommend this product to help give life back to your hair. It's not a miracle worker, but it's definitely putting health back into my dry strands.",5,One,B00SNM5US4
"For my friends with long hair who dive... I’ve found something new! Remember the last big breakthrough was the Crave gentle detangling brush (i assume its targeted at parents with little kids who have tough to brush hair)

Now its Olaplex No. 3

Yeah, i thought this was a joke. Two separate (completely unrelated) stylists were like “use this stuff”. I was super skeptical because I’ve always been told that hair can’t be repaired and you are kinda stuck with what you’ve done to it (at home I mean, cause i hear there are some crazy amazing salon treatments out there that I can’t possibly afford). I didn’t buy at salon prices (luckily found it online for less).

So currently my hair is X number of years long, mid back, stupidly baby fine, moderately over processed, dyed, bleached, sun drenched, and salt water destroyed. I’m using the Olaplex 1 day a week (mostly because i only wash once or twice a week unless I’m diving a lot and of course have to remove the salt, but then its just with a conditioner)

Results are kinda nutters. hair in the drain has diminished after week 3, less breakage for sure, and my hair feels ridiculously silky slippery when dry. You know that feeling that little kids hair sometimes has? The kind of hair that the cuticle isn’t rough -at all-, so smooth that hair bands just slip out of it? yeah, that. For reals. So yeah, week three, the jar of product is small but I expect it to last for at least another 10-12 applications. The reviews say that hair keeps improving with each use.

Historically by the time my hair gets this long its epically trashed and my hairdresser starts mentioning ‘maybe taking a bit more off the ends so it looks thicker?’, but this time around its going differently. This time the stylist actually said ‘wow, you hair is better than it was last time!’ Big change 🙂",5,2,B00SNM5US4
When I bought this product I just thought it was a deep moisturizer and I didn’t expect much out of it. I bought it because my hair is in really bad shape it’s very thin and it has lots of short hair is in phrase that sticks out.

"If I could, I would leave 0 stars... It actually damaged my hair much more . It dried my hair even more and parts of my bleached hair just broke off.... The biggest mistake!",1,11,B00SNM5US4
"I have bought this product 4 times now. I can NOT express enough how much I appreciate this stuff. I have dry, brittle hair when the temp changes. I NEED this stuff. I just went the whole summer without it and when the temp dropped my hair got so bad. I cried even messing with it. After three days of straight use, my hair is smooth, not frizzy, the bonding agent is freaking fantastic!! Please, never discontinue this. I wish I had pics of before and after and I know not every review is trustworthy, but what do u have to lose?? I cannot express enough my love for this product!!!",5,2,B00SNM5US4
Didnt see any sort of difference. Left the product on for over two hours. Disappointed.,1,32,B00SNM5US4
"This stuff saved my hair I went from dark brown, almost black hair to caramel highlights with chocolate lowlights in one day. The first picture shows my hair literally from one day to the next when I first got it done 2 weeks ago. The bleaching process was brutal, and I was afraid I would end up with split ends, breakage, and hair that felt like straw. My stylist mentioned adding Olaplex to my hair color, so I figured I would look it up and see what it was. That's how I found out about the #3 Hair Perfecter & decided to order some and try it out. The results were immediate. My ends felt hydrated and my hair was left soft and with very little shedding. This stuff is expensive, but definitely worth the cost if you are someone who colors or bleaches your hair. I simply wash my hair once, then apply it to my damp hair and let it sit for a few hours. I then wash it again and apply conditioner and allow that to sit for a while or overnight. Rinse, blow-dry, press and style, and I am good to go. This stuff allows me to achieve salon results at home without going to the salon every week for maintenance, and enables me to rock heavy highlights without worrying about damaging my hair. I would definitely recommend it!",5,2,B00SNM5US4
"I bleach my hair as pale as I can to dye it various fantasy colors. My hair was in very good shape when I started bleaching it half a year ago and I’m doing my best to keep it that way. After hearing the glowing reviews I decided to try Olaplex to maintain and improve my hair’s health.
I started using Olaplex a month and a half ago. My hair was newly bleached and dyed and felt a little dry, frizzy, and stressed. I applied the Olaplex once a week, for at least an hour, but often longer. I also use a coconut oil mask every week or two.
I noticed an improvement, but wasn’t immediately sure it was the Olaplex until I bleached my hair again. Right after the bleach and toner my hair didn’t feel bad at all. A little dry, but not as bad as before and not at all stressed like the last time. I think it’s made a big help to my hair and as long as I continue to bleach my hair I will be using Olaplex. I’m also going to buy Olaplex 1 and 2 for future bleaching.",5,2,B00SNM5US4
"I read about this product in some beauty internet article (Elle?). It was to be miracle product to bring my blond dyed hair to shining healthy hair. I got fried, dry, and color STRIPPED hair. Just returned it but now what. I have to have it cut shorter and hope that my NATURAL shine and health will come back. What a rip off. I should be able to charge the manufacturer for my haircut and emotional distress.",1,5,B00SNM5US4
"I used this as it was directed. The first week for 20 minutes, skipped a week, and the next week for 50 minutes. I couldn't do anymore, it was so drying.

I have a mix of 2C- 3B hair type, but extremely coarse strands. I've bleached and dyed my hair in the past (most of which is cut off now) but I thought this would add moisture and define my curls. It did the opposite. My hair felt extremely dry and brittle after.
I normally don't do anything to my hair in regards to heating/ styling, coloring, or anything, so if you're natural I wouldn't recommend this.
I understand for some people it works wonders, for me it did not. With the price point and advertising it's for ""all hair"" you'd think it'd have some beneficial affect. I guess it's trial and error. I'll stick to my jojoba and argan oils.",1,One,B00SNM5US4
"I heard all the rants and raves about Olaplex and wanted to try it at home. Mind you, my hair was pretty fragile from lightening it to a platinum color previously. This did not take away the dull, lifelessness of my hair fried hair. It made it pretty soft, but not any softer than a brand from a local beauty supply store. The formula was very watery and felt more watery than most drug store brand conditioners. This was purchased directly from Amazon so there should be no excuse for a ""fake"", although, this did absolutely nothing for improving my hairs quality. For your reference, I am a latina woman who has coarse, wavy, thick hair. Maybe this will work for super fine hair textures, but it did not work for my hair type.",3,4,B00SNM5US4
"Honestly cannot believe how well this worked for me after just one use. I left it on for 15 minutes instead of 10. WOW IT WORKED!!! I did not expect it to work like it did, but I though it was worth a try. I never write reviews but I just felt like everyone who has damaged their hair needs to know about this! It's a total miracle. I have tried everyhting and nothing worked. This has !!

Just look up the science behind it. This product was made by an actual chemist and has shown to be much more effective than any other bonding treatment.

My hair was so dry, like horse hair. It did not dry on its own..so mushy and gummy. Just yuck. Now its soft and dry quickly and feels like it had never been bleached. I'm amazed.

Before and after pictures",5,3,B00SNM5US4
"This stuff is gold. I have fine, long hair but lots of it. It's been colored many times and I recently transitioned from a brunette back to my natural ash blonde with a blonde balayage. Needless to say my hair was not happy and I had tons of split ends even after getting the salon olaplex treatment. I was told by my hairdresser to try this at home and it works. The trick is to put it on damp, towel dried hair and leave it for like an hour. I put it through by bleached ends only where the damage is (makes the product last and saves $$), clip it into a bun, and put a plastic shower cap over it so it doesnt dry out. People complain that it dries out their hair or makes it unmanageable but this is NOT a conditioner. After rinsing the product out, hair needs to be shampooed AND conditioned. I use a pretty heavy conditioner in the ends by Aspen Kay that is a bar conditioner and the two leaves my hair really soft and manageable. It took about 4 treatments before my hair felt like it did before the bleaching and I did a treatment 2x a week and I wash my hair once every 3 days or so. Now I'm only doing a treatment once every week or two. Super happy with this product and will continue to buy! Has saved my hair.",5,2,B00SNM5US4
"Olaplex fixes damaged hair. I’ve used it on my bleached hair and my daughters blonde hair and it makes such a huge difference like no other product out there. You can have your salon person do the same treatment for about $30 plus tip, or you can purchase this and have at least 6-8 treatments. You only need about a quarter size (1-2 tablespoons dependent on hair length - ours is short to just past shoulders so long hair needs more). Leave on for 15+ minutes (hours is fine if you have the time and do not let it dry up) on unwashed, damp hair and then wash and condition as usual after treatment.",5,2,B00SNM5US4
"First things first, I have fine, short, frizzy/curly, damaged hair that I heat style about 3 times a week and color maybe once every 3-4 months.

I wanted to make sure I waited a little while before I wrote this, because I wanted to make sure it actually worked as well as I thought it did. And I'm happy to report it's that good and better.

I've used Olaplex no 3 about 6 or 7 times now (that's just under 2 bottles for me because my hair is short and fine). I've purchased from Sephora online (my local stores dont carry it) and from Amazon. I was worried about buying from Amazon because you honestly never know what/who you're buying from, and there would be no way to know it was fake until it was too late. This bottle smells EXACTLY like the bottle I got from Sephora, and they were almost the same color. However, the sephora bottle was EXTREMELY RUNNY. Like, to the point I had a hard time putting it in my hair because it was just sliding right off. It was the first time I had used the stuff, so I thought maybe that was normal and I just had to learn the technique. It worked okay, took about 3 times before I really saw any results beyond just being kinda softer.

Now this stuff... I hadn't done an Olaplex treatment in about a month (cause I'm broke folk) but I've still been heat styling my hair AND did 1 color deposit treatment. So I was going into this with pretty jacked up hair, and honestly this stuff worked even better than the bottle I got from Sephora. And I got it on prime day so for about 1/3 the price, so there was pretty much good feelings all around!

I know some people have complained about receiving fake product, but that wasn't the case with me. Maybe it was a fluke, or the bottle I got from Sephora was bad, but either way I'm so very happy with this purchase and i will be buying from Amazon again.",5,One,B00SNM5US4
"This product is amazing. It's transformed my damaged hair. I can't recommend this product enough. My stylist stopped using it in her salon in order to cut costs and switched to something else. Her new product doesn't work so I've been buying this myself and using it and getting the same great salon results. It makes my hair so soft and smooth. I have highlighted hair that only had minimal damage until I took a medication that caused my hair to fall out and break off. It was the worst my hair had looked in my life. It's slowly growing back and Olaplex is helping it to look and feel healthier as it grows out. I'm not great about using it religiously, but when I do my hair is amazing. 2-3 times a week is ideal for really damaged hair and you don't need much.",5,One,B00SNM5US4
"I have bra strap length African American natural curly hair I texturized and colored. I bought this in a panic and it stopped my hair from snapping off everytime I touched it but it's such a small amount for $30 which lasted 2 washes. Before repurchasing I tried Downy Fabric Conditioner and it actually worked better at a fraction of the price!
If you're gonna try fabric conditioner you'll want one that's plant based without preservatives, fragrance, parabens, sulfates and etc.
Wash your hair, apply fabric conditioner, leave on about 30 minutes with a plastic cap, rinse with cold water, then twist into a towel until dry.
My hair was ultra soft and fluffy afterwards with no other conditioners or moisturizers. I'm going to try other brands to compare their results. Good luck!",4,One,B00SNM5US4
"Ok...I have been rolling my eyes about this stuff for months, refusing to purchase, opting for cheaper products. During Covid I have subjected my hair to bleachings with novice overlapping, over processing, mixing the home kit wrong, box dyes, cheaper home hair cut scissors, you name it. I am now guilty of it. But I also admit to have learned so much! I almost lost hope with my top blondes, which are now fragile, like whispers of the ghost of my previous hair. I got Olaplex #3 and expected nothing, since I have tried coconut oil, sweet almond oil, avocado oil, argan, leave in conditioners, It's a 10, lamellar water, protein filler, egg yolk and honey masks. ETC. Then I tried this. I could feel after the very first use that it was different. The pics are before first use and after the second use, wet and dry. No other product in my hair. I could have spent $28 on this instead of the handful of !*@(*#)$* that I already tried! Also, I ordered another directly. Same smell, same consistency, both sealed. I'm not a cult member and I expect to still have to keep my blondes in rehab until they grow out...but I now have hair that feels like hair. It really is a Covid hair miracle. FWIW--I use no heat and style very sparingly, as damaged hair is damaged hair. Be realistic and while it may FEEL like magic, it doesn't make the damage permanently healed. I apply to freshly washed hair and left on for an hour each time. I may regret it but ordered 0 to see if it helps and will review when I try that in conjunction with 3. Also am using this on my lightened peekaboos underneath to see if I can help breathe new life into that hair before my bright pinks go on top. Watch out for home self bleaching jobs...they can get addictive. And I now have a whole world of understanding as to why it is best to see a professional, always!
Update: Also bought Olaplex #0 and tried it in conjunction with 3. It was fine...just be aware it is nothing more than a bottle of water plus the active Olaplex ingredient in it. Smart move on their part, as 0 and 3 are the ""at home"" version of the salon treatment of 1 & 2. I have since also tried Olaplex 4, 5 and 6. Those 3 have horrible smells (to me.) #3 remains the star in all of them for home use.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"So... I did something super dumb... bleached my hair from deep, dark red to a pretty light blonde as I'm impatient and wanted an immediate change rather than properly lightening it over time... End result, the color looked good, but my hair felt like dry, brittle straw. I couldn't get a brush through my hair. And when I pulled on a strand, it would just stretch out and then snap. I've never seen anything like it. It was horrific.

Afraid I was going to have to cut it all off and hide indoors for a year until it grew back, someone suggested Olaplex. This stuff literally saved my hair. While it isn't perfectly healthy again, it looks and feels like normal, soft, smooth hair. I'm absolutely amazed. I can brush it, style it, and it actually feels healthy to the touch again! The bottle is quite small, I only got 4 uses out of it. But it was worth EVERY PENNY. Highly recommend!!",5,2,B00SNM5US4
"Este producto me llego super rápido y eso que vivo en Perú. Además, hidrato y reparo mis rulos!!! Super bueno, 100% recomendado. desde el pedido hasta la utilización del producto. No necesariamente tienes que tener el cabello teñido, es para reparar e hidratar tu cabello. En caso este seco o dañado. Normalmente se tiene que hidratas constantemente el cabello rizado. Así que, tomas solo un poco por cada mechón de cabello y dejas actuar 20 min. Hazlo siempre cada semana y veras la diferencia total!!!!!! :)",5,7,B00SNM5US4
"I have virgin all natural hair. However, my hair is very dry and I was looking for something to repair damage from blow dryer and heat. I used the bottle twice and follow the instructions exactly writing on the bottle and even went and watched YouTube videos just to be sure. After using this product twice on my hair, I did NOT see any results. In fact, my hair got more dry and brittle, and I noticed every time I used this product, my hair is falling. For those of you who have natural/virgin hair, be careful.",1,2,B00SNM5US4
Make sure you use this product only if your hair is damaged. If your hair is healthy you might damage it by adding too much protein to it. I have bleach my hair and also use purple shampoo. The consequence is that my hair is very dry and has lost a lot of nutrients. This product is bringing my hair back to a healthy look. I use it once a week at night and hour before bed. I leave it on all night long as It actually ends up trying by itself. In the morning and take my shower and my hair is fabulous.,5,3,B00SNM5US4
"When I first started seeing people talk about Olaplex No 3 I was seeing the same old things: revolutionary product, will change your hair, repair, shine, smooth, reduce frizz, Heathy hair in one treatment! Uh-huh. Ok.

I have hip length, 3B, CGM hair. I didn’t want to spend $30 on a product that was just like all of the other products promising the same things that I’ve been using for years. And for me a bottle would probably be one treatment. I was WRONG. This product delivers all of that on the first treatment. It is the single best hair product I’ve ever used.

After one treatment (I can get about four treatments out of a bottle) my hair looked and felt better than it has in my entire life. I’ve been using 1 -2x per month and see improvement with every application. This stuff is amazing. It’s not a conditioning/ moisture treatment. It is a chemical treatment that repairs the damage. It actually makes your hair more healthy by repairing bonds broken by heat, color, ponytail holders, dry brushing, environment, hard water, chlorine, etc.. My hair is mirror shiny, smooth, soft, and incredibly manageable. My curls are clumping on their own like they used to when I was a kid and I have increased shrinkage and volume. My hair is just healthy in a way it hasn’t been during my adult life.

The directions say to apply to damp hair and leave on 10 min, then shampoo and condition. I leave it on until my hair drys which takes 2-4 hours and then I wash and condition. The extra time makes a noticeable difference in results for me. Their website says it’s safe to leave on for an long as you like, but they don’t recommend sleeping with it because it might get in your eyes. But I think you could do this with a plastic shower cap.

Note: Olaplex 3 is CGM safe, but not all of the products from this line are. Which is a shame because I would happily spend the money on the shampoo, conditioner, and leave-ins if they didn’t have silicones.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"I have used this product about 3x since I purchased it. Hoping each time might get better.
It didn’t. This is a straight trash product & will damage your hair more then help it. I have some what dry hair from getting a balayage. So I was looking for a product to help put some moisture back into my hair. This is the total opposite. Dried my hair out even more & had to go get a deep conditioning at my salon. If you’re looking for a mask type of product this is not it!",1,2,B00SNM5US4
"I swear it’s like these reviews are fake or paid for because it did nothing for my hair. I used 1,2 and 3 and my hair was still dry and unchanged. I ended up trying another product from a different company that is a quarter of the price and works a thousand times better",2,3,B00SNM5US4
"I am someone who has colored their hair , many times. I am good at it, but it weakens the hair.
I saw a video on olaplex 3 , and the rest of the regime, and had to try this. I am determined to keep my hair healthy and stick to a nice light blonde shade , for a while. I want my hair to feel good and look healthy. I used this only one time , and the little pieces and that weak feeling went away right away. I have only only used this once. I wish I had a before and after pic. Perhaps, I will just upload a pic soon. I am convinced that olaplex 3 , and the rest of the regime is the best on the market.

"I have 2c/3a/3b hair (wavy/curly) that I have flat ironed my whole life until covid hit. Mid-pandemic I decided to stop blow drying and flat ironing and embrace my natural curls. My hair was rather damaged, dry and frizzy. I found Olaplex and saw so many reviews and videos of people using it saying it would help repair damaged frizzy hair so I thought why not, I’ll give it a shot. It can only help, right? Nope! My hair completely freaked out. What was frizzy was uncontrollably and unbelievably more frizzy than it had ever been before. It was awful, I considered going to back to flat ironing. Thankfully my hair calmed down weeks later with use of deep conditioning products. You don’t get a lot for product the money either. I’m sure it works great for some but I won’t be using it again. Really disappointed.",1,One,B00SNM5US4
"Update: I've been bleaching my hair for over a year now. This is my 5th bottle of this olaplex. I stopped for a while because I find it expensive, but my hair got trashed really quick from two bleaching sessions with no olaplex in between. I even tried doing rice water protein masks, but didn't notice a difference. My hair was so damaged it wouldn't dry on its own and was falling out a lot more than usual. Went back to putting this on overnight once a week and after the first wash my hair felt semi soft instead of brittle. This stuff makes a huge difference and saves my hair so I can have that bleached look I enjoy.

It's pretty expensive for how little comes in it. Also you have to leave it on way longer than the bottle says. I recommend leaving it on overnight or at least 4 hours. It didn't make my hair seem stronger or softer until after I did a 4.5 hour treatment on dry hair with it. Online it says after 45 min it does something, but that's not my experience. Also I have very thick hair halfway to my waist and it only did 3 treatments.",5,One,B00SNM5US4
"I accidentally over-processed my hair a little bit bleaching and my usual products (Keratin, amino acids, and hydration masks) were barely touching the incredible frizz and limpness that was my beautiful, long hair. Amazon Prime had one day delivery on this item so it was a no brainer: I bought it. I lightly shampooed my hair, towel dried my hair, slathered this crap on, and slept in it overnight. Next morning lightly shampooed and did a repair conditioning mask for 15 minutes (Joico K-pak Color Therapy Luster Lock, my holy grail of conditioning if you're interested, my hair type is thick and straight). HUGE DIFFERENCE between how it looks post-Olaplex and my frizzy puffball from yesterday pre-Olaplex. My hair is 18 inches long and I will get about 3 applications from one bottle. I should note about 5 weeks prior I had an Olaplex treatment done in a salon with #1 & #2 so maybe that has enhanced my results, although Olaplex says you can use #3 as a stand alone and still get results. My hair still needs time to heal completely but this has helped speed up the process by probably one week.",5,One,B00SNM5US4
"I totally love this product. I have read many review stating that this is not authentic. I am extremely familiar with the entire Olaplex line. This is definitely authentic. The viscosity and the smell is exactly the same. I also have the exact same results as when used in the salon. I only wash my hair twice a week. I dampen my hair prior to washing and apply the product, then sit for 20 minutes before washing. Perfection. My bleached hair is super healthy!",5,8,B00SNM5US4
"I've only done 2 treatments and it works! Ok last month I went to my hair dresser because I wanted the balayage look. Well She left the bleach in my hair way to long! Then days later after she applied toner for the second time / it still turned orange after a few days, and that is what you see in the pictures. Well I didn't want to go back so I bought the shimmer lights shampoo and conditioner and it helped take that orange out! But my hair still looked nast dry and brittle! I decided to try olaplex treatment and so far its helping as you can see on the 3rd picture. I will continue to use and will update! I recommend that you use it while hair is damp so that it spreads easily. I have very thick hair and I believe that I can get at least 4 treatments out of it.",5,2,B00SNM5US4
"Some of the reviews said their product was fake and watered down. This was not the case for me. I recently lifted my natural almost-black hair to platinum blonde/silver. It took 3 salon visits to lift me this much, so parts of my hair were damaged and stretchy. I received this yesterday and immediately got my hair wet, and put this all over my head, concentrating on the fuzzier parts. I put on a disposable shower cap, and wrapped my hair in a towel. I left it on for about four hours. I have very thick, coarse, shoulder length hair and used 1/4-1/5 of the bottle. It was not watered down, and it smelled very nice-not like chemicals. After 4 hours, I washed and conditioned my hair as normal. When I got out of the shower, I combed my hair and could already see a huge difference! No more stretchy-ness in the damaged areas. Now that it is dry, it is much less fuzzy in the more processed areas. My hair doesn't feel softer (which is fine, my hair doesn't really soften anyways), but it LOOKS way healthier. I am amazed by this product. I would recommend it to anyone. I think by the time I am done with the bottle, my hair will be back to normal. I would also recommend to just dampen your hair, not completely saturate it. I feel that I was able to get more coverage with damp hair than soaked hair.",5,46,B00SNM5US4
"My hair did not feel stronger or look healthier after using olaplex 3. I followed the directions exactly. Instead of repairing, it noticeably dulled my dyed auburn hair color. Then, gobs of hair fell out over the next couple weeks (regular shedding from the roots, not breakage from damage). I do not bleach my hair, I only use permanent dye to darken my hair. The good reviews I saw for No. 3 must really be for No. 1, used when lightening hair color in a salon?",1,3,B00SNM5US4
"I’ve read so many glowing reviews about this conditioner so I tried it.
Pros: concentrated, very light scent, minimal packaging, moisturizing
Cons: not a holy grail product
Bottom line: While it’s a decent mask, I prefer others like Curls Blueberry and Living Proof. My hair is low porosity, 2c/3a a d not chemically processed for reference.
If you have chemically damaged hair, it may produce more dramatic results
Tips: use on damp hair and shampoo and condition as usual *after* rinsing it out.",4,4,B00SNM5US4
"My stylist turned me on to theses products at my last visit. I am 57 and have thinning, menopausal hair. It is a little past my shoulders. Whatever this stuff does, it has made my husband actually stop and tell me how gorgeous my hair looks. I have less breakage, more shine, it is fuller and thicker appearing, holds my style which is just loose finger waves to reduce heat damage. I am now using this product 1-2 x weekly and I have the shampoo, conditioner, and styling creme. You literally only use a pea-size amount of all of them. So the bottle lasts a while. I have not tried the oil as my roots get greasy looking anyway. I am far less self conscious of my thinning hair now. This is a game changer for me.",5,One,B00SNM5US4
Anything from this company has changed the Hair industry. I have been licensed for 33 years & this is the first product that has been developed that actually heals the hair shaft from root to tip no matter how much you change the color of your hair or bleach it repeatedly like my daughter. You should use the entire lineup in order to receive the best results. You won’t be sorry. This is an honest review. I don’t normally write them. I realize it’s expensive but it’s worth every dime. For long hair you should purchase 2 of everything. Now also if you have split ends I would suggest that you trim just the ends off. It is difficult to repair split ends without trimming. Otherwise the hair shaft splits all the way to the scalp. Also if it’s been longer than 3 months without trimming your ends because the product is so expensive you want to ensure you start out with a fresh cut on your ends.,5,One,B00SNM5US4
"Learned about this product through IG, did a lil research and order this here. Found the product to be authentic & untampered with. As I wasn't looking for a product such as this, I wasn't even aware it existed! What I was aware of was my long naturally brown hair was a frizzy/flyaway mess! As we are all stuck in quarantine status.. I have been doing all I can to invest in my brand. That includes being more detailed and consistent in my self care routines. I have neglected my hair for probably over 2 years, washing it less, not deep conditioning, or anything other than wearing it in a ponytail 🥴 First step I began taking collagen supplements a year ago, consistently, but with through out the winter month my hair became extremely dry & began to fall out whenever I combed.. Concerned about thinning, I came upon this product and was intrigued naturally. Used this recently this week and the results are so positive. After washing, treatment, wash & dc... my hair is not brittle, or frizzy. Also I realized the Neocell Collagen + C supplements have lead to significant hair growth... dounke positive. I spread this treatment out in sections focusing in the middle to end, comb through my hair redistributing product around the crown, cover my hair foe 90 mins then rinse out. I do not heat treat my hair, at all, allowing the hair to air dry. I plan on treating my hair with this product once a week until the bottle is gone. Thanks to IG for introducing me to this line of hair care! 💜",4,0,B00SNM5US4
"I added a before/after photo but the before is kind of hard to see with the background. I badly damaged my hair bleaching it from black to blonde but I’ve been able to save it with Olaplex. I have used all the products (except 4 & 5, the shampoo and conditioner) and the results have been fantastic. I wanted to change my hair lighter and longer, but after lighting I was sure I’d have to cut away most of the damage, my hair was gummy when wet, frizzy when dry and a little tug on any piece would cause breakage. After 2 months my hair feels soft and smooth and has stopped breaking. I cannot recommend these products enough. They really worked for me.",5,One,B00SNM5US4
I have graying hair which has been colored treated. It is naturally wavy. I followed the instructions and left it on my hair for 25 minutes. I feel no difference. My hair is coarse and frizzy. It doesn’t look any different. It is not shiny or smooth. I am deeply disappointed given the rave reviews. Would not recommend nor would I waste $28 on this ever again. I could bought any conditioner and it would have have had the same (lack of) results. Then I’d have $25 in my pocket.,2,2,B00SNM5US4
"This literally works. Hairstylists use this to fix damaged hair and they swear by it. I bleached my hair and some Parts burnt and were over processed, my hairstylist told my to use this 3 times a week because of my hair situation and it did wonders. This product works in the bonus of you hair so fro the inside. Don’t expect that you will feel that is super soft because it repairs your hair inside out. Overtime because it will recover your hair you will feel it stronger. I recommend leaving the product over night and when washing condition and use a hair mask. It will leave your hair flawless. Also give it a few uses to see more evident results. It is an expensive product but it is worth it. Before I use to buy so so many many masks and conditioners but with this I’ll rather invest in one product that works.",5,One,B00SNM5US4
I got this product to help my dry dyed hair. I put it on for two hours and washed then styled my hair. I DO see a difference...is it silky smooth and super glossy-no..but there is a clear difference. I kick myself because I didn’t do a before pic. I plan to use it on my 10 yr olds head and see what kind of results I see. I like this product and plan to keep using it. The bottle is small and for the price I was slightly skeptical but a little goes a long way. I have medium thick hair and it’s down to my shoulder blades. If you’re looking for something to help repair damage and smooth your hairs offer all appearance-I would suggest this product.,4,One,B00SNM5US4
"I’m not a professional but any professional hairstylist can tell you this is a game changer.

Olaplex 1 and 2 are used at the salon, but Olaplex 3 is your saving grace at home. I just bleached my hair from dark brown to platinum over the period of two weeks and I could not have done it without this product.

It is not a conditioner, it is a bonding treatment, which means it will bond your frayed hair back together. You can use it whenever you want, wherever you want and how often you want, the more you use it the stronger and healthier your hair will be. Even if it is in terrible shape because of coloring and heat tools start using it now and you’ll be flabbergasted at how it repairs hair.

I’ve been doing my hair at home for many years, much to the chagrin of my hairstylist, but I could not have Gone platinum at home without Olaplex 3. Miracle product.",5,One,B00SNM5US4
"I have followed directions provided in each manner, and use. I bought every single product in the biggest size made. I am almost done using everything and have not noticed any change in my hair what so ever. My hair has now been treated over 15 times at least. Sometimes leaving in # 1 or # 2 on my hair for extremely long periods. Still nothing. I believe I had better results using Moroccan moisturizing shampoo and conditioner. This was huge waste of money for over $350 for everything!",1,5,B00SNM5US4
"Ok I purchased this because I bleached my hair & this came recommend.
I've never used this b4, first time bought it here so I don't hv anything to compare it to. And I say that because unfortunately, I hv come to find out that some products sold here on Amazon are not the real deal, even when in description bit might say it is. So with that said, I was hoping to see at least some moisture in my hair, a bit of softness, a lil sheen but this does nothing for my hair but except to leave it feeling starchy...ugh.
I wish I could return this but already past the due date.
So I leave u with this, buy at ur own risk.",3,One,B00SNM5US4
"It’s a tiny bottle for the price, but worth it. If you spend a ton on getting your hair colored then this makes sense. I only use it once a week and it makes my hair far less brittle and overprocessed. It only takes a little. I just happened to see this in a magazine as one of Drew Barrymore’s favorite items. I ordered on amazon. I had just changed salons and realized my new Salon uses it. Even though I love when my salon tries different things on me I always request that they use this because the after effect after a coloring is so noticeable.",5,3,B00SNM5US4
"This is GREAT for strengthening your hair, but it does bother me the company isn't honest about what it is. It is NOT a conditioner. After you use this, you need a GREAT conditioner. I just wish they would be honest. Now, I see they are selling shampoo and what?....a conditioner! Shocker. I have had a lot of breakage over the years for various reasons. Thus is the best strengthener I've ever used. Adds a ton of volume. Great product. I should disclose I bought directly so can't speak to authenticity here.",5,4,B00SNM5US4
It is not real olaplex. It didn’t help my hair at all so I bought a different one from an actual olaplex retailer & they don’t smell the same. I called olaplex and they told me that Amazon isn’t an authorized retailer,1,4,B00SNM5US4
"A friend of mine swears by this product so I purchased it. I read a lot of reviews first . Seems like a lot of people LOVE it and others say it's horrible and broke their hair off. I'm kind of in the middle. While it seems there was some moderate conditioning to my hair, it's nothing to rave about and certainly not worth what I spent on the bottle. I can get the same result with some hot oil treatment. So overall, I rate it 'meh'.",3,3,B00SNM5US4
"I was introduced to this product by my hair stylist and it was definitely a life changer for my bleached hair!

During the pandemic, salons were closed and I wasn’t able to maintain my bleached/blonde hair. I am naturally a brunette but have gone blonde/platinum for the past 4 years now. Let me be the first to tell you that blonde/platinum hair is the most high maintenance color for a natural brunette. It requires constant maintenance, hours at the salon, specific products, and lots of patience.

A good stylist will tell you that you can’t go from brunette to blonde in one sitting. It isn’t safe for your hair and you could lose lots of your hair. So it took me over a year to get the color I wanted safely. Unfortunately when the pandemic hit I wasn’t able to go to the salon for months! So when salons finally opened again, I was desperate to get my hair back to the way it was and was willing to do whatever it took. I did a full bleach with toners as well and it took several hours. My head felt like it was on fire.

Long story short, I lost so much of my hair after insisting on going hard core with the bleach and toner. It was very noticeable and made me feel a bit unconscious since I’ve always had nice hair. But low and behold Olaplex No 3 has saved my hair life and has helped bring my hair back to life.

It has strengthened my very thin hair making it feel thicker and healthier. I notice almost no split ends and my hair still remains soft. Please consider this product if you have a hair story similar to mine OR if you have thinning hair. You will not regret giving this product a try.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"Update
:Finished the olaplaex 0 & 3 purchased from the Olaplaex website this time. I don't know, maybe you have to use this for like a long time before you see results. In that case it's just too expensive for long term use for me. I expected from people's YouTube reviews to have much better results by now, I mean I used 2 bottles so far and added the number 0 to see if it would reap better results. I'm glad it worked for some people I just don't think it's worth it for me. May still have to transition and still had to cut a couple inches off my ends which are still super dry and frizzy looking and my hair still looks half dead.

I honestly can't say that I've noticed a huge difference in my hair which I bleached near-death recently. I got 10 uses out of the bottle because I have fine low-density curls. I'm sure it probably did something, but maybe I need to continue using it for a while so I bought another one along with the no 0 from the Olaplex website this time. Hoping for more noticeable results this round.",2,0,B00SNM5US4
"Overrated, didn't do anything special for my hair - but that could be due to the fact that I did not have steps one or two done at salon - UPDATE! I now why it didn't do as promised, this product is FAKE. AMAZON - PLEASE BE MORE DILIGENT STOPPING FRAUDULENT PRODUCTS - I have now purchased several items on Amazon that have proving to be FAKE",1,34,B00SNM5US4
"I was a bit skeptical when I seen the price for such a small bottle, but I said to myself treat yourself the reviews keep selling you 🤷🏽‍♀️! I’m natural with a million different hair patterns and it seemed like no matter how well I took care of my hair I could never get my hair to be curly enough to wear it fully natural. I would suffer some type of heat damage no matter how much heat protectant or how low of a heat setting I used, even the 1 pass method, damage would always appear. I consistently used this for a month by washing my hair once weekly and using this as a pre conditioner or a mixed in my deep conditioner. The heat damage is reverting and my hair bonds are thickening and looking stronger. This definitely repairs the bonds and and give your hair life again no matter the texture. I didn’t use steps 1 or 2 prior but I did also use their leave in conditioner and bonding oil when using this. I definitely would recommend his product and even buying it from here. I’ve seen a lot of reviews where they said they feel like they received a different product but I can honestly say I’ve never had this treatment done in a salon and the product I received seems to be legit since it’s repairing my hair. They have me sold for life, it’s definitely worth every penny.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"Tons of breakage. While washing it out of the shower, everything felt soft and lovely. However, I’ve noticed with introducing this product into my regimen, I’ve experienced a ton of breakage. My hair was frizzy before, not particularly damaged. I only had a few highlights in, but I had cut out a lot of the damaged parts. Given this is the newer product in my routine, I will promptly stop using it. Too much unexplained thinning and breakage of the hair (a lot of which was untouched by the highlights).",1,7,B00SNM5US4
"I absolutely love this product! I have curly 3A/3B hair. I cut off all my hair in 2019 due to excessive heat and chemical damage. After growing out my hair again, I bleached it twice and needed a bond repair treatment to help my hair become healthy again. This product does an amazing job at repairing my hair and making my hair smooth, silky and shiny again, all while making my curls more defined and healthy. I immediately noticed a difference after using this product the first time, and continue using this product at least once a month. I would love to use it more frequently, like once a week, but this tiny bottle cost nearly $30, so I don't use it often because I want to preserve it as long as possible and only use it when necessary, such as before/after bleaching or straightening my hair. I would highly recommend this product if your hair is damaged, or even if it's healthy it will only help your hair become stronger, softer and healthier.",,0,B00SNM5US4
This is an update review. I bought this stuff back in March and it absolutely made my hair soft. But the breakage was still really bad. So I gave it another shot and bought it directly from the Oplex website. The stuff I got from the website seems to be working much better and lasts longer before I have to redo it. The product itself is great but I’m not convinced that the stuff I got here on amazon was the real product.,3,3,B00SNM5US4
"*update* it took me a while to realize THIS IS NOT A CONDITIONER! Once I started using it as a treatment instead of eclectic it tomake my hair soft, I understood this is like when you use a protein treatment or some other kind of repair, it's not softening it's repairing, I started using a small amount of leave in conditioner after my shower and I notice better hair, not a lot, not enough to buy again but pretty good if it we're cheaper I'd buy it again.
*old review* I'll update my review after using it a while but my initial impression is that I don't understand the hype. I use cheap deep conditioning packets that are way better. It did temporarily soften and smooth but a day later my hair looks almost fried. ( I did dye it and use another product loreal elvive smoother) but it seems like for $28 bucks I would've thought wow! But I'm like meh
So far. Maybe using it after the salon olaplex treatment (what you're supposed to do instead of a standalone item) I bet it would be much better.",3,0,B00SNM5US4
"I was reading about the ‘is it the real product, or isn’t it’ debate. I don’t know because I have never purchased it from anywhere but Amazon. What I do know is that, the last time I had my hair colored at the salon a bunch of it broke off and my hair was ruined. Devastating. I have used this Olaplex 3 three times, and I can already see a difference. The broken ends are laying down, rather than sticking out and curling up. My hair feels softer and doesn’t get tangled up near the nape of my neck due to the breakage. I was very skeptical because every product says it will fix your hair. I actually think this is helping my hair. I don’t take writing comments lightly, and I wouldn’t say these things if I didn’t feel it was helping my hair. I hope this comment helps people make up their minds about Olaplex. When you have fine hair to begin with, having swaths of it break off is saddening. Good luck!",4,One,B00SNM5US4
"I can’t say enough positive things about this. It literally saved my hair. I tried several other bond repair treatments prior to using this because other reviewers were saying it’s not that great, but it is. My hair had been over processed from years passed, two current treatments of color oops and a current bleach wash (even though I have level 4/5 ask brown hair). My hair was rough to say the least. Touching it would make you cringe. Literally straw. In December I had 8” cut after the recent treatments I did and I vowed to get my hair healthy again for good and grow it back. Even deep conditioning and the other bonding treatments didn’t help as drastically as olaplex did. I always had these patches, especially on the side, that looked like they were dead ends, except they weren’t. (You know those frizzy, dead looking things more towards the top of your head)...yeah. So, I bought this. I used it once a week for now one month. My hair is now baby soft. No exaggeration. No frizz, no dryness, no dead ends...nothing. My stylist said it is soooo much healthier. I keep asking her to trim it and she keeps saying there is just no need for it especially since I’m trying to grow it back. I seriously can’t even remember the last time my hair has been this healthy! My bottle isn’t even empty yet and I am VERY liberal with it. (My hair is just past my shoulders right now but thinner). I leave in for one hour (after shampooing and conditioning) and follow with a deep conditioner after every use. I will most likely purchase another bottle after this one and continue the process for at least a few months. I should have thought to take a before pic and will add one if I can find one that counts.",5,One,B00SNM5US4
"I used this to help my hair after bleaching. My hair is soft, however I left it in for 20 minutes to try and make sure it completely saturated my hair (the bottle stated 110minutes, longer if necessary) ...and it stripped my pink permanant color out. Every review I read said that this wouldn't happen, but I used nothing else new. The back of my head is white/ blond and it washed the pink out. Super super disappointed. For this cost, now I have mismatched color hair.",3,2,B00SNM5US4
"I used lightener, semi permanent color, color eraser, more lightener, and permanent color on top of that. The only reason I'm not bald is this Amazon order of Olaplex. I prefer to buy it from my local salon between services but that wasn't possible during my quarantine self service so I took a gamble and ordered it from Amazon. Same stuff, same results for me. I've had zero breakage and I have very fine, very thin hair that is naturally a dark brown. During quarantine, I have been jade green/ northern highlights to uber blonde but is now pale blonde/blush pink and I can still run my fingers through it. Thanks to the bond builders in Olaplex, I have zero frizz. I love Olaplex and I wasn't disappointed with this purchase. I'll post pics ASAP. Also, never ever use semi permanent jade green dye on your lightened blond hair. It lingers like a mf.",5,One,B00SNM5US4
"So I have really dark, really fragile, baby-fine, curly hair. I have to bleach a minimum of 2 times to get the lift I want for coloring over it, but of course when you have the world's most fragile hair type, that's really just begging for punishment. For most of my life, I have been unwilling to endure the level of extreme damage that this does to my hair. There's only so much of my life I'm willing to spend crying in the bathroom with a comb hanging from my head and half my hair on the floor. Now, I can (carefully) indulge.

Don't get me wrong, my hair is still damaged as hell. But this stuff REALLY helps. In the immediate aftermath of a bleach, it can take my hair from feeling like wet hay to normal hair that just happens to be really dry. And that's a difference that has allowed me to reunite with my love of colorful unicorn hair. Thanks, Olaplex. Next time I won't be so cheap and I'll actually spring for the Olaplax 1 that you add to bleach, cause if this is what the low-power stuff can do, I'm a believer.",5,One,B00SNM5US4
"I imagine that this product might be great for really damaged hair or dyed hair. I have long, wavy, fine, natural silver hair that has never been dyed. It takes a beating from sun and swimming, but I try to take care of it. I noticed that it was beginning to look a little damaged and I decided to try this product. I have now used it twice ( a week apart) and I have not noticed any really difference. The ends might curl a bit more, but that's about it. I was hoping that it would feel smoother, silkier, stronger......but I can't say that it the case. I will finish the bottle and see if my opinion changes, but at this point given the cost of the product, I would not purchase it again.",3,One,B00SNM5US4
"So grateful for this product.

My fine thin curly hair was always so unsightly that until I was 24 I would wear a bandana or hat and took the time to wear it down just a few times a year and it still flew away and looked like crap within 30 minutes.... thats no way for a young woman to live. I had given up.

I decided I’d relax it risking the chemical damage and there was a little, enough to risk length with my fine hair. The ends were so dry that they would tangle and break. This product made it as if I had always had long smooth straight healthy locks...

And for that I am so grateful. I wear my hair down all of the time, have taken such delight in getting to know my hair and learning to style it, and feel like a new woman entirely. Thank you Olaplex. Relaxing my hair turned into a wonderfully life changing decision rather than a choppy gummy nightmare thanks to you.

PS: I know they say it runs its course totally after 45 minutes but I feel like the result of the time I slept with it in was monumentally better than the time I washed it out after an hour.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"I bleached my hair and left it on a bit too long. When I rinsed the bleach out, some of my hair was stretchy, like elastic and I had some hair falling out. (OMG!) I have colored my own hair for a long time and done well, but this time my luck ran out. Ooopsie! :(

That led to frantic searches on the interwebs looking for any possible magic potion that could save my waist long locks. Thank god for Olaplex #3! I got used it today and my hair looks and feels like it's in MUCH better condition. It's still a tiny bit frizzy on the ends but so much better than before. According to the directions on their site, for severely damaged hair they recommend doing the treatment 2-3 times the first week. Yup, so I'll be doing that and I bet my ends will look even better.

I was afraid I was going to have to cut off my beautiful hair but I am so glad I refused that as an option and I looked and found an answer. My hair is no longer falling out and it's not stretchy anymore. Seriously this stuff is a god send!

I will be doing more Olaplex treatments AND some great deep conditioning hair masks. This stuff is for strengthening, not conditioning.

I am extremely happy with this product! Miracle in a bottle.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"I swear by this stuff. The before is a month ago. My hair has grown a decent amount. About an inch. It grows fast. I started watching brad mondo and was introduced to olaplex. The before picture is before I started using olaplex and the after is proof my hair looks healthier. Before my hair was dry and straw like now the ends are soft like virgin hair. Before I started using olaplex, I was thinking about shaving my head but now I don't have to. It softens extremely damaged hair and the scent is amazing. If it doesn't work, you're probably not using it right. Dampen your hair when your hair is dirty. Put olaplex in for an hour (that's what I do once a week) then rinse it out, wash your hair and use regular conditioner. The directions state clearly on what to do. It is not conditioner so don't use it as such or leave it in. Oil is for that not the type 3 olaplex. It works just follow the directions.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"Not sure whether it was the shampoo or the conditioner, but this crap made my hair fall out! I've never panicked this bad ever in my life!!!! I'm returning this!!! I used it in the salon and never had an issue. Definitely I DO NOT RECOMMEND BUYING THIS!!! buy it from your local salon so you know you are getting a legit product.",1,3,B00SNM5US4
"If you haven’t tried this glaze, you must. I color my hair and expose it to high heat with the tools I use. This glaze makes my hair feel moisturized and adds lots of shine. I use it about once every 10-14 days. It’s an easy treatment to do at home and most salons charge at least $25 per application. The small bottle lasts me about 8 applications.",5,2,B00SNM5US4
"My hair has been terribly abused lately. I've relaxed, bleached, colored over twice, with red permanent color and flat iron every time i wash. The damage was showing. It felt like paper after I got it done a week ago and my color was fading already after the one wash. I used this olaplex#3 once. I did follow with a madison reed glaze in barolo, and washed with color protect shampoo and conditioner. My hair looks amazing, feels soft bouncy and the shine is out of this world. I don't think this product did all that but, I do attribute all the strength to it. I'm sold, I'll be using it every week.",5,2,B00SNM5US4
"I used this for damage control after bleaching, and that's exactly what it did. I bleached my hair twice, and then dyed and toned it all in less than 24 hours, while using this in between, and I have very little to no breakage. I did use a different brand of bond protector while actually completing the bleaching and dying process (with different ingredients than Olaplex), but even after rinsing out the bleach and toner and color, I could feel that my hair was ""dry"" even while it was still wet (some of you know what I'm talking about!). This is where I applied the Olaplex - It has a recommended ""sit"" time of 10 minutes, but I left it on for about 30 each time. My hair is very soft, no ""crunch,"" has shine, and I sustained very little (if any) damage. I read somewhere that this No3 is supposed to build off of their No1 and No2, but I used this as a ""stand alone"" with that other bond protector I mentioned and it worked! I will probably purchase their maintenance shampoo. Also should be noted that even though I have done my hair many of times on my own, this past experience was a little more out of my control and I found myself having to do a few ""Hail Mary's"" to control the situation. My hair didn't turn out as I originally set out, but it turned out looking good and I am thankful I had the Olaplex this time around!",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"My hair is very dry and falls a lot which is terribly sad! I heard about Olaplex from my hairdresser.
I do not over process my hair and do not use the flat/curling iron often, I am giving it a low rating because it did not strengthen my hair in any way and did not improve the appearance of dry/dull either, I was not hoping for a miracle but I did hope for smooth and shiny hair but it didn't happen.",2,2,B00SNM5US4
"I’ve read a bunch of mixed reviews on this product (olaplex #3) and honestly, i was extremely hesitant to try it out for myself. Seen this on a prime day deal and decided to try it out.
While rinsing it out of my hair, I could already feel a difference. I have severely damaged hair by the nape of my neck (born with this btw and hair stylists can never do anything to help it-it looks like a bunch of spilt ends) and that’s where I noticed the softness. I’ve never felt (even after salon treatments) that softness there.
Upon my hair drying (without heat of course bc what’s the point of this if you’re going to use heat right after and also I used my normal Redken anti-friz shampoo and conditioner bc this is not a conditioner, you must clean your hair after using) my hair felt absolutely wonderful! It’s super smooth and feels like I’ve just left the salon.

Honestly, I wish I bought more bottles of this when it was on sale. The price is a bit much but now having tried it, I see why.
Try it out for yourself, I believe you won’t be disappointed.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"I don't know why it asks to rate drying power... That has nothing to do with Olaplex no. 3 Anyway I was pretty let down by the product the only reason I gave it some stars is I do think my hair felt a bit stronger. That IS what this product is supposed to be for, strengthening hair. Everything else about it is pretty sub par.
The scent is okay, but it's not much of anything one way or the other. The product was a bit thinner than I was expecting. I was also surprised when I read the directions. Apply to towel dried hair, then follow with shampoo and conditioner. I figured it would be the other way around, use after conditioner, but no.
So after getting my hair wet, then drying it off a bit with a towel I put some of the product on my hair. It didn't really coat my hair very well.
I have baby fine hair, tons of it, longer but not too long. It's bleached out from dark brown to light blonde, and could always use more moisture and strength. I figured this would be just the thing to help me as I try to grow my hair to be very long.
It took so much product just to coat all of my hair!! What would normally have been plenty of product for say a hair mask or conditioner was no where near enough. I had to use three times as much as I would expect. It didn't glide through my hair well leaving it tangled which made it even harder to get enough on my hair. I try not to pull on my hair when it's wet, but I had to comb through it to get my hair fully saturated.
Once it was washed and rinsed my hair felt weighed down and not moisturized at all. When my hair fully dried I noticed it felt like the strands were a bit coated (stronger maybe?) For all of the hype I would have expected much much better than that.",3,0,B00SNM5US4
"I learned about olaplex when the salon added it to my hair color. I had been coloring my hair several years and had keratin straightened hair, then wanted to go blonde, and my poor hair was so dry it’s hard to even work shampoo through it when wet. I accidentally found a stylist video on YouTube about olaplex recommending to use olaplex 3 at home to repair hair after coloring. The salon failed to tell me about Olaplex 3, so I tried it. What a difference in my dried out hair. All I know is after using this one time, the shampoo and conditioner went through my hair like there was no damage, and after washing I can get a brush through my hair as well without tangles. After blow drying, my hair is swishy, which it has never been swishy. Feels good against my neck. This is a tremendous product. I think for the price there are about 5 treatments in the bottle for length to the shoulder hair, if using once a week. I left it on my hair for one hour. Very happy, this stuff is a miracle for my hair. $28 vs another brand 5 procucts at $148, I’ll take the Olaplex.",5,One,B00SNM5US4
"I love my stylist, but she told me this was hype. It wouldn't hurt to try it, so I did... and I'm so glad it was on a Prime Day discount that got me to do it. WOW. I go blonde streaks in my curly hair (half white/half asian) and I can't normally finger comb through at all at a certain point where we may have accidentally doubled up on highlights. Now? MUCH better. It's not perfect, but 3 treatments later? I am SO glad I did.
I've read not to use it too much, since it only works to a point, but I'm either there now or not done yet, haven't gotten to hating it. 3 uses in, I have half a bottle left for my thick, waist-length hair.",5,One,B00SNM5US4
"I dyed my hair platinum blonde and was told it would be very damaging to my hair. This was recommended to me by a couple friends. I was hesitant on buying it but only because it seemed like such little product for the price. I found out that a little goes a long way. I put this in my hair right after dying it, and once a week after that. When I'm done showering, I comb this through my hair and leave it on for an hour or more. The longer you leave it in, the better. It is NOT moisturizing, in my opinion. This isn't a deep conditioner. I've noticed a huge difference in my hair. It looks nicer, softer, and healthier. It feels like silk to the touch, as if I never dyed it to begin with. I've been using the same bottle for about a month now and still haven't run out. I sometimes follow-up with a deep conditioner.",4,0,B00SNM5US4
"I don't know what this stuff does, but it's awesome. It's not a conditioner, it just...fixes your hair. I'd gotten an application from my hairdresser, and I couldn't believe how my comb would glide through my hair when I'd wash it afterward. I'd had an area in the back of my head where I apparently hold the blowdryer a little too close, and it had gotten dried out, and after a few applications of the Olaplex, all of my hair is smooth and shiny. Like I said, I don't know what this stuff does, so I can't make any sort of scientific testimonial, but whatever it does, wow. I love, love, love this stuff.",5,One,B00SNM5US4
"My hair is treasure to me and as a little girl, momma kept amazing care so my hair was always gorgeous and shiny and soft to the touch. But as the chemicals came in with hair dyes and the burning with the blow dryer and/or iron, my hair although still long was very damaged at the tips and just looked dull overall. So I started a search for something to revive my poor locks. And then, I was introduced to my little miracle hair mask. OLAPLEX Hair Perfector No. 3!!!!!! I have gotten so many compliments on my hair and have used the product for such a short amount of time, I can't imagine how much healthier and beautiful it's going to get. but I can't wait and am about to purchase more! My hair's condition has improved 90%, I mean, I air dry my hair a lot and it takes the perfect wavy look with bounce and SHINE, so muuuuuch shineeee !!!

It smells divine !!!!! I love hair products that aren't to sweet or minty and this almost smells like Chanel Shampoo! Ha! But seriously, so good!

I've recommended to at LEAST 10 Random people. They all want to know what I do to keep my hair looking so fab. And I am happy to share this secret because sheesh what a turn around for my mane!!!

And then let's add the family members I've told need to hop on the OLAPLEX train.

#thisisnotanad but definitely a super happy customer with her hair results' true story!!

This product is amazing. I have damage to my hair from using hair ties as I work out/do martial arts on a daily basis so it gets damaged from the hair band and from pulling in ground work and sparring. After 2 uses my hair which was dry and knotted easily (also have wavy/curly hair) was at least 50% better in texture and I could run my fingers through my hair without tangles. I did leave the product in overnight (with dirty hair) then washed it out the next morning. Added bonus is that it seems to help keep my hair from frizzing. Highly recommend this product.,5,3,B00SNM5US4
"After I ordered this product I read the reviews. Yeah, I know! A few were saying this wasn’t the real deal so I went over to Sephora’s website and thought about ordering from them. I read a ton of reviews and decided to curb my rashness...for a change. Silly to bounce around like an out-of-control ball! It arrived today and after putting it in my har I put a shower cap on and let it sit for three hours. I’m older and alas, hair gets older too! It’s in pretty good condition though and is 2 inches below my bra strap. The ends tend to be frizzy so hence this product! After washing it out and drying my hair I looked in the mirror and I was rather ecstatic with the results! Plus it is shiny and feels like silk! So is it actually Olaplex? I can’t say for certain, not having tried Sephora’s; but I would say it is and the looks of my hair would say it is so I will be buying it from Amazon in the future.",5,One,B00SNM5US4
"I don't do a whole lot of amazon reviews but this one deserves it. I used this together with Olaplex No.1. Put No.1 on dry, clean hair, then I put No.3 on over top of that. I know it says to leave on 20 min, but I left on overnight. First of all, it smells incredible. I love the smell. And then the next morning I shampoo and condition and after I dry my hair, after just one use there was noticeable difference in the texture and flyaways. Did not weigh hair down, I have long, very fine hair that was over-processed and I use this 1-2 times a week and it keeps my hair very nice. I will get it again. Have used about 5 times and only halfway through both bottles",5,One,B00SNM5US4
"If you have high porosity, natural, textured hair, I highly recommend this! I'm very excited about this treatment. It feels like a conditioner when applied (although it is NOT), and when I washed it out an hour later, my hair felt obviously in better condition. My strands were clearly smoother, shinier and easier to comb through. I plan to use this especially for the bottom half of my hair because that gets the most breakage. I have about 10"" of afro-textured hair and used about half a bottle. Maybe I was heavy handed, but I see myself using this continually once a month or every 6 weeks to make sure my hair is as strong as possible. I also alternate between henna glosses and cassia treatments as my deep conditioners on other weeks. I use rice water, flaxseed gel-I'm a super diy natural hair advocate. But sometimes you do need to fill in the cracks with the power of chemistry. This just fills in anything missing in my routine for repair. It doesn't mess with anything else I'm personally doing, although I have 10 years experience with my natural hair (3 big chops, know how to make my hair grow quickly). I'm definitely fitting this into my routine. My hair looks and feels AMAZING! Excited to see how this will help my hair over the long term which seems like where you'd see the biggest benefit. Try it! They have trial kits if you're not sure. But at least N°3 is worth spending the money on. Going to try the conditioner soon too.

Also the price is high, but for what it is, it's worth it. There's plenty of other treatments that cost the same but don't work as well.",5,One,B00SNM5US4
I’ve used olapex 3 for years. Maybe twice a month for 5 minutes on towel dried hair for maintenance. Was excited to find it on Amazon. I have no clue what was in that bottle but my hair felt like it was going to fall off. It instantly felt dried out. Seldom I’m disappointed or write a bad review but that was definitely not the product I normally purchase from my stylist. 👎🏻 I couldn’t even brush my hair. Had to re wash my hair and condition to make it manageable and my hair still felt yucky.,1,One,B00SNM5US4
"This does what it says. I’ve used it once in 4 weeks and my hair still looks great!

Everyone is different. I have generally abundant healthy strawberry blonde hair, longer (mid back) with a lot of static, dryness, “flatness” and more split ends in winter.

I applied as directed, erred on the side of thoroughness, left it on overnight, and rinsed in the morning to get the most out of the first application and it yielded the desired effect.

I still use quality products for regular washing and conditioning and my hair looks far better than it has in previous years. This product has eliminated all those winter issues, each strand still looks healthy and vibrant 4 weeks later, has wonderful body and shine, and no static.

I’m pleased, and I imagine will get another application or two out if this bottle if I apply it the same way when the need arises.",5,One,B00SNM5US4
I DONT KNOW IF THIS IS THE REAL OLAPLEX OR NOT BUT IT LITERALLY FEELS LIKE WATER! I USED THIS ABOUT 3 times and got the same results. After placing on my hair I left it for 3 minutes. My hair started falling out little by little after I put the shower head on it. MY HAIR NEVER DOES THAT. THIS PRODUCT WILL RUIN YOUR HAIR NOT FIX IT. I WANT A COMPLETE REFUND!,1,7,B00SNM5US4
"I've been using this product biweekly for the better part of a year now, and I really like it. I would use it weekly, but it takes 1/3 to 1/2 a bottle to saturate my hair, and the cost of using it twice as often has so far dissuaded me.

I wash with a clarifying shampoo to make sure I don't have any lingering silicones or product in my hair that might interfere with absorption, then apply this throughout dampish hair. I usually put it up in a bun and cover with a processing cap to keep it from drying out (since it supposedly stops working once it dries?). I get the best results if I wait at least 4hrs before shampooing, preferably 6hrs. I haven't gone 8hrs+ yet but I suspect it might work even better.

After a follow-up shampoo and condition, my hair feels softer and looks shinier. I don't know if it's actually stronger, but it definitely feels less brittle and more hydrated. I haven't noticed an increase in shedding or breakage despite dying every couple of months, which I started only in the last year, just before I started using No.3.

Side note, I've purchased No.3 from the manufacturer's website as well. The products appear identical and, on my hair at least, seem to work the same way. I don't have a lab to test the actual chemical makeup or anything, but the products I've received appear genuine on a cosmetic level.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"I started the curly girl method about 2 years ago after flat ironing my hair my whole life. It turns out my hair is actually very curly - 2C/3A, low porosity, and coarse. I started using this product about a year ago because it was so heavily recommended across multiple curly girls on instagram. It was a gamechanger for me. It helped my curl pattern tighten even more and it really helps undo any damage you may have been doing to your hair. It's almost like a reset button. I usually layer it on dirty hair on a wash day with my deep conditioner and let it sit under a hot cap for 30-60 minutes. Then, I shampoo, condition, and style as normal. (I do dirty deep conditions because it helps with preventing build-up on my low-po hair.) It is pricey, I will say that. But, a little goes a very long way and I usually can go months before I have to buy a new bottle, even using it fairly heavily on a weekly basis. I definitely notice a difference when I stop using it for awhile. Again, I can't say enough great things about it, and it smells heavenly!",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"I want to confirm that this is indeed authentic Olaplex. I’ve been using it for almost half a year or so, and I always bought it from Sephora until recently. I decided to see for myself if the rumors about this stuff being fake were true or not. I compared this bottle to the bottle from Sephora, and it was exactly the same. Same scent, same texture, same AMAZING results!

Olaplex has saved my hair after bleaching it white blonde. I’ve used other products similar but nothing works as well as Olaplex. I leave it in my hair for 30-60 minutes. I can feel the difference as soon as I wash my hair and after it’s dried, it feels soooo soft and looks incredibly healthy and shiny! Olaplex is a MUST for blondes! I guarantee you will not regret trying it. It’s a complete game changer & miracle product.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"I have had dry, wild, frizzy, thick but fine- stranded hair my whole life. It breaks if you look at It very hard. I straighten it with a hair dryer and it becomes a broken straw broom. I have used “repair” products on my hair for decades with a “yeah whatever” attitude. So I bought this other “repair” product expecting more of the same, except maybe a bit softer. IT WORKS. It is literally the only thing I’ve ever used that made a difference. I don’t understand how and I don’t know what kind of hair wizardry it uses, but it literally stops my hair from breaking. I even (gasp) bleached some of my hair and it is not damaged!!! Where was this product when I was a dork in middle school with hair so wild I couldn’t fit through doors? Thank you to whatever hair god figured this out!",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"This stuff is gold. I'm super bored at home right now so I bleached my hair three separate times in two weeks to get it to the color I wanted. Stupid, I know. This stuff didn't improve my hair back to its original smoothness, but on a scale of 1-10 (1 = straw-like, 10 = virgin hair smooth), it went from about a 2 or 3 to a solid 7. Magic. Sucks it's expensive and I needed the entire bottle for one treatment (I have shoulder length thick hair), but I would say it's worth a treatment.",5,One,B00SNM5US4
This stuff is pretty amazing. After reading the other reviews I was hesitant but my stylist recommended this so I gave it a try. My hair was very damaged from over bleached highlights and I’ve been trying to repair it over the last year. Nothing else worked more that being a daily detangler. After one use of Olaplex Hair Perfector the repair was noticeable and the effects have lasted several weeks between reapplying. At this point I’ve used it probably 6-8 times and the bottle has probably another 2-3 applications. It’s a small bottle and pretty expensive but I think it’s worth it. My hair feels soft and doesn’t have noticeable breakage anymore. Don’t expect that you will get is shiny silky movie star hair unless you already have it.,5,0,B00SNM5US4
"I normally healthy hair has suffered from changes in medications in the last 6 months. My hair was breaking and shedding. I saw Olaplex recommended on the NBC Today show and decided to give it a try. It is not conditioner per se. You wash your hair, towel dry it, then add a small amount of Olaplex 3 to your palm. Apply the white cream to your hair and leave in for 10-20 minutes or so. Olaplex is described as ""bonding your hair."" After 20 minutes, I shampooed and conditioned my hair as usual. The damaged hair lost the dry, split-ends look and looked healthier. I dried my hair and styled as usual. Very pleased with this product. Package suggestions say to apply 1-2 times a week. I probably used about a teaspoon when applying.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"My stylist originally recommended Olaplex. Since I don’t see her anymore (trying to save $), when I ran out, I bought Olaplex through Amazon. I recently colored my hair myself and it went very badly. After yet another attempt at coloring and several uses of silver shampoo to fix the horrible orange outcome, my hair was fried. Olaplex saved my hair. I left it on much longer than recommend, but now that my hair is heathier, I just use it as directed. Amazing product. I’m a user for life.",5,3,B00SNM5US4
"Having used a salon purchased bottle of this formula prior, I dont believe this to be a legitimate product. Packaging is same but scent and texture of product inside is different and it did nothing for my hair. Verified product used previously made drastic improvement in one use. I'd advise buying elsewhere.",3,3,B00SNM5US4
"Okay so I was a level 6 red violet with a hot red intensifier for almost 3 years... before I continue.. #imsorrybradmondo 😂
I woke up one day was like I’m tired of red let’s go platinum 😳😬 knowing this was impossible without some damage.. “my hairs long I can afford to lose 3 inches” 🥴
ordered all my professional bleach supplies (blondeme).. an decided to go ahead an get this hoping it was a Hail Mary for whatever I mess up... an let me tell u.. after a full bleach bath with 30 vol, a full bleach application with 30 vol & and a partial application with 20 vol (with no extra hands to help so i did this over roughly a 36 hour period for my arms bein so tired 😩🤣..) needless to say my hair was dry... in the first picture that is dry frizzy & air dried because I was afraid to even brush too much with the breakage & how my hair felt & would just tangle up instantly.. (I cried thinking I fried all my hair off)... well wet my hair (didn’t comb out cause yet again it was fragile) an applied the olaplex very generously.. threw on a plastic cap and left it for 2 hours... the 2nd pic is after olaplex and a shampoo & condition my hair with a blow dry (which hours before I would have never attempted).. it repaired hair that was already damaged before I ever bleached. My ends haven’t even been trimmed off from the bleach yet and aren’t all that terrible.. I would fully recommend.",5,One,B00SNM5US4
"The first time I used it, I followed directions. Put a small amount on clean, towel dried hair, left it in a few hours then rinsed it out and shampoo/condition again. My hair definitely seemed softer. The second time I followed step one and two but I got busy running errands so I tucked it into a hat and then later took off the hat and just let it air dry completely. My hair is even softer using it as a leave in. It doesn’t even seem like I need to wash it out! It feels amazing. For reference my hair dries pretty straight, it’s fine and long so I’m not sure how it would work for others. I use it once a week and try to only wash my hair 1-2 times a week. I hope I can continue to use it as a leave in because the instructions on the bottle are kind of time consuming.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
This is the real deal. Its a wonderful treatment. I leave this on 20 minutes and it really amps up my hairs health. With this product more time does not equal more result. Your hair can only absorb and take so much of it. I tried ab overnight anyways and 20 minutes was perfect for my platinum overproceased hair. Longer left my hair feeling stiff like when you overload your hair with protein (this is not a protein treatment just comparing thw texture) I would highly recommend vuying the travel set and doing an at home treatment. There are many videos explaining that process on YouTube. Hope this helps someone especially you blondes out there who needs this in their lives,4,2,B00SNM5US4
"I use this on both my natural 4c texlaxed & my hergivenhair Kinky blowout u-part wig. Since beginning the #3 treatments, I find that my hair retains moisture better than it ever has and it thicker and stronger. As for the use on my human hair wig, I figured it will greatly extend the life of my investment.

I saw that some people say this is a fake product. I can’t speak for anyone else’s O#3 but I compared it to the sample tube that was included with my O#0, purchased directly from Olaplex and both are a soft creamy white, not a thick yellow as another reviewer mentioned.

I am a true believer in what this product does for obviously, every type of hair so I will continue using this treatment.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
So I bought this on the recommendation of a friend. She wets her hair and applies and sleeps in it ..with a cap. I just wet my hair ( hair has to be wet) applied and kept on or an hour making sure my hair stayed damp. The texture was improved but not to the extent I expected...BUT after using several times. I can now see a noticeable improvement in my hair being softer and less Straw like. Will keep using... also make sure your hair stylist uses the first 2 steps in this lineup if you do highlights or color. I told my hair stylist about this line up and she said she had been using it on me.. that is why I always say my hair feels better after I leave. There is a whole line up of products in this line. This one is step 3. Step 1 and 2 are for your stylist to mix in your hair color. Step four and Five are the shampoo's and Conditioners.,5,0,B00SNM5US4
"Covid has been bad for curly hair— have not had a haircut in over a year now and had been doing it myself at home. This led to some very bad ends

Put this on my hair and completely changed my look. My hair had come together at the ends again and was so soft and shiny after just one use. I use it once a month now or when I really need it because it’s so expensive and does not come with a lot.

I originally applied it after washing and just rinsed it out + conditioned afterwards, which did work, but I would do a deep condition after instead of just regular conditioner.

Would definitely buy again",5,One,B00SNM5US4
"18 months ago I had a full head of purple hair. My hair has been bleached time and time again, I finally decided to go back to my natural brown with a blonde balayage, Needless to say, even going to a professional who was VERY mindful with my hair, always doing things slowly as not to damage it, I still ended up frying my hair. I have thin hair and an oily scalp so I stay away from heavy conditioners or products that add to the oily look. Being purple for a year, almost black before that, and heavily highlighted before that, my hair had been through a lot of stress. A few weeks ago I was so sick and tired of the breakage (visible when brushing), like BAD breakage, I finally decided to try out the Olaplex I had heard so much about. I didn't tell my stylist I was doing it, but I would be seeing her a few days after my treatment for a touch up. As soon as she started working with my hair she asked my what I did that it looked so so healthy. We ended up not having to cut much off because it was so great. I was preparing to cut off three plus inches and this stuff saved me. I listened to a friend of mine who is a prof stylist and works with vivids who reccomended I sleep with it on. i got about 10 hours with it on over night, washed and styled my hair like normal the next morning and I havent had to straighten it to ""tame"" it since. i have been styling it just blow drying it with a round brush. Would 1,000% recommend this to everyone with damaged hair.",5,One,B00SNM5US4
"Okay so I get why it's so expensive now. I had over processed my hair and it was so badly damaged, it was breaking. I tried everything (any hair product that said anything about ""for damaged hair"") and it was still breaking. I didn't want to chop all my hair off because I've spent the last 3 years growing it out so I bought this stuff. No duh, it saved it! Like completely saved it. Don't get me wrong, I still had to cut a couple inches off the bottom but that was a lot better than, you know, having to chop like 8 inches of hair off. No breaking, it's slowly coming back to life and feeling soft again, I can't believe it. If you're wondering if it's really worth the money, I'm telling you it is.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"I had big hopes for this tiny bottle. My hair was double processed from a natural bark brown to a blonde then greyish brown. At the end of my day at the salon my hair was dry brittle and beyond repair.

I scoured amazon for something to help. Before Olaplex, when I washed my hair, it would feel strangely spongy. After the first treatment my hair felt the closest to normal since double processing my hair.

I had to do a double take and start the process over again when using Olaplex no. 3. You use it as a mask first on damp hair for 10 minutes and then go on to shampoo and condition. It felt very odd to do so but it’s worth following the directions.

Ps if you see that my hair color is different in the before and after, it’s because I used a color boost with my conditioner. I didn’t like the dirty grey the salon had given me.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"This product came as advertised. Same as the one I had from Sephora (I had read some reviews on here that it wasn't the same). I have fine texture, shoulder length color treated hair. This product is quite simple to use, you just totally wet your hair and towel dry it (you don't want it dripping) , apply the product throughout (I use approx 1/4 of contents for an application, a little pricey but I want to take good care of my hair). Afterward I put a clear shower cap over my hair and do whatever about the house or catch up on some TV shows. It says to leave on for at least 10 mins, I leave in my hair for 1-2 hours (I want to reap as much benefits of the product as I can). Afterward rinse it all out and shampoo, condition , blow dry and style as usual. I find it makes my hair silkier, shinier and gives it body and bounce. My hair has the I just left the salon feel after using this product. I really like that is doesn't have a strong scent, I would describe it as pleasant but very mild. I just snapped a pic of the back of my hair with my phone so you can see for yourself.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"First off, I just want to say that I have never written a product review in my life. But I had the most incredible experience with Olaplex that I had to share.

I have always had relatively dry hair, it's naturally very light blonde and I spend a lot of time in the sun and salt water so it tends to get even drier and almost bleached-like in the summer. It got so bad recently that my hairdresser had to give me bangs to get rid of hair that was essentially irreparably damaged. She suggested Olaplex and I thank her non-stop for it.

I bought the full set and used for a little over 2 weeks and my hair is SILK. It feels so strong and healthy and its bright and shiny every day and never looks dull anymore. When I let it air dry it's never frizzy and when I blow dry it, it never feels dry. Days after washing, it still feels and looks just as great.

Every day my hair feels like I just left the salon. EVERYONE should be using this set!!",5,One,B00SNM5US4
"My hair was feeling a bit angry.. maybe a bit more than angry... I am in the process of lightening from having had it dyed a very dark brown. Add to that my love of a flat iron? Okay, my hair might be very angry.
This product? Unbelievable. I've bought every product and tonic and repairer known. I will never buy anything else. I shampooed only with #4 first (think a lot of argan oil desperately trying to keep frizz and fried ends at bay already on my hair so needed to clear that away) and then put this on. When everyone says a little goes a long way? It does! I usually eye roll at that but in this case it is true.
I left it on for an hour while I did some housework and then shampooed back out and followed with #5 conditioner and a little leave-in Davines milk. O.M.G. My hair is silky. I let it air dry and there was NO FRIZZ. NONE!! Literally (not figuratively) went from frizzy, please help me from the humidity to walking a couple blocks in the rain this morning and my hair is not just silky.. not just frizz free.. it is bouncy! It feels and looks healthy. All this after one use? I will never not have this product in my arsenal. You will never regret spending the money on this magical substance.
LOVE LOVE LOVE!",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"I lightened my hair a couple times trying to even the color and my hair (long, just under shoulder blades) got gummy and too watery/porous; Olaplex no. 3 helped to repair some of those bonds and reduce the gummy texture and help my hair dry normally and 'heal' from the lightening. Best case, Olaplex should be used before the damage is done to lessen it, but masking for a couple house every few days is still helpful after the fact. Any longer than a couple hours and I understand it doesn't really do anything, so no need to sleep in the product like some claim. And remember it is not a leave-in, you must wash it out. I used this in conjunction with Aphogee.",5,One,B00SNM5US4

I am addicted and I'm going to get my hands on all Olaplex products I can possibly have.
My hair is so silky and beautiful - I can't believe it's mine. I applied once in between the relaxer and the keratin treatment and saw an improvement. Applied two more times after the keratin treatment, and I'm really impressed. This is truly the best product I've ever used. I didn't think humanity had come up.witb anything better than Kérastase yet. But this is it!
This tiny bottle only lasted me 3 treatments because my hair is mid back length and thick, and I also throughly soak the hair - ABSOLUTELY WORTH EVERY PENNY. SPREAD THE GOSPEL, SYSTERS! YOU DESERVE IT!",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"I'm not sure I received authentic Olaplex. The packaging/ consistency etc is all on point, however, I gave myself a treatment yesterday and my hair looked crunchy today. My hair guy SWEARS by Olaplex and he's an absolute hair magician and he gives me Olapex treatments regularly (but you can't buy No. 2 if you're not licensed, so I opted for No. 3.) All I know is whenever he finishes with my treatments, my hair feels and looks 10,000x healthier and restored, but the product that I received left me with my hair in what I felt to be worse condition.",3,3,B00SNM5US4
"Nurgle's Wife Here: I compared this with the Olaplex that I bought directly from Olaplex and it appeared to be the same in every way. I like Olaplex and use 3 regularly. It works great for keeping my hair in good shape and keeping split ends at bay. My hair is naturally wavy and if I don't feel like trying to coax out curls, I'll use a small amount of Olaplex in my hair after my shower, then brush my hair straight, and let it dry. It dries very straight, feels soft and smooth, and it doesn't feel weighed down (I don't use a lot of product, maybe a dime size, but I have thin hair so it doesn't take much for me.",5,One,B00SNM5US4
"I ended up cutting my hair short in August of 2018 because my ends were looking pretty terrible and the rest of my hair wasn't too great either. I've been trying to grow it back out while taking better care of it, although because my hair dries super weird and frizzy, I usually end up using more heat than I want to. The Olaplex Hair Perfector No 3 has done a fantastic job of keeping my hair smoother and looking healthier.
The directions say to leave on for at least 10 minutes, but I try to leave it on for at least an hour, usually close to two. I know that isn't possible for some of us, but I have noticed it definitely works better the longer you leave it on your hair! My hair is so soft and silky afterwards. My hair has grown out quite a bit in the last few months and I think the Olaplex might have something to do with that. It looks so much better than what it did before I cut it all off!",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"I read numerous reviews that sang rejoices over this product, so I had high hopes. I used the product 3-4 times per week and left it in for 12 hours or more each use and saw little to no results. My hair is still as tangled and dry as it was prior to using. Wondering if I didn't get the real product, or what happened there. Will not be repurchasing again. Very disappointed.",1,3,B00SNM5US4
"I am not sure if this is ""real"" olaplex or some knockoff as some people have posted. Regardless it works! I use at night after showering and apply and let my hair dry naturally and in the morning jump in the shower again and as the directions state I wash and condition as usual. I have told everyone that I know with hair issues about this and so far everyone that has ordered it as pleased as I am. It leaves my hair shiny and manageable. Initially I thought that it made my hair feel like baby hair and i would not be able to do anything with it, but it actually makes my hair MORE manageable. Soft. Silky Healthy looking hair.",5,2,B00SNM5US4
"Where to begin...first, this is NOT a conditioning mask!! Do not think that it is and try to use it as one. I use this on damp hair and left it on for 20 minutes. After, I washed my hair as usual. I blow dried on low heat and then straightened.

My before hair:
Dry, unmanageable, frizzy, lackluster

My after hair:
I have my hair back from when I was 18! After one use, I am blown away. Before, my hair wouldn't straighten even on the hottest setting, it would end up frizzy and immediately curl when I stepped outside. After my first use, I could turn my heat WAY down and my hair straightened like magic. I am ecstatic! I can't wait to see how it looks after a few months of using once a week.",5,One,B00SNM5US4
Finally!!!! A prewash mask that delivers what is promised!!! I have medium to thick wavy (dare I say frizzy) color processed hair. I regularly color and highlight/lowlight my hair at the salon. Spending that kind of money to keep my hair in top shape I have been SEARCHING for a hydrating prewash hair mask that would not weigh my hair down and would help keep my ends hydrated. This one delivers!!!! I highly recommend getting the shampoo and conditioner that go along with the hair mask. It’s the trifecta for keeping my hair wavy without frizz. I use them once a week as a repair for all the damage I do coloring and styling my hair with heat tools.,5,0,B00SNM5US4
If I could give this 0 Stars I would. It did absolutely nothing for my hair and if anything it looks drier than before I used the product.,1,8,B00SNM5US4
"I watched too many YouTube videos about how to bleach your hair at home and absolutely wrecked my hair. The highlights look good but my hair was brittle, crispy, and tangly after two bleaches. I’ve used this product twice now, soaking it on towel dried hair for 10 minutes before rinsing and then shampoo/conditioner as normal, and holy Jesus I can’t believe my hair is actually BETTER than it was before I bleached. Get it gurl, you deserve it. Treat yo self.",5,One,B00SNM5US4
"I honestly thought I was going to have to shave my head after having the worst highlights of my life. I have very fine hair- but a ton of it- and the stylist wasn’t paying attention to the time and- viola- over processed hay hair. They couldn’t even comb it out before what felt like half my hair was on the ground. I bought this and Keratin complex blondeshell for 1 day shipping. Saturated my hair in anything hydrating I could- body lotion and face oils included- wrapped it up and couldn’t wait until tonight when my products arrived. This product is a miracle. Much to my amazement after the first 20 minute treatment tonight, I blew out my hair and it felt like hair again. Of course now I have to wait for the tufts of breakage to grow out, but this stopped the breakage in its tracks.",5,One,B00SNM5US4
"My rating is harsh as this is expensive and claims to be a miracle. I’m an admitted cosmetic junkie and obsessive about my hair and products. Yes it conditioned, it did it’s job in that manner. I did not find it any better than nexxem or bed head which are far more affordable. On error I double clicked when purchasing ( $100.00) and ordered the leave in conditioner. I’ve used the products for about one month per instructions twice per week. I find more benefit from the leave in. Also to be fair I bleach, tone, straighten and curl my wavy damaged hair. I expected far more. It did not damage my hair as I’ve seen some claims I just don’t think it made a difference. Will not buy again but will continue to use until gone",1,One,B00SNM5US4
"I was hesitant at first about this product because I saw a video from Sephora about it, but a number of people didn't think Olaplex was that great. However, I recently had a hair cut and my stylist used this as a treatment for my hair and afterward he used Wella's shine oil as a finish. Overall, my hair felt so much softer and less dry. So I bought Olaplex hoping it would continue to help. Yes, it has!!! I've used it twice and each time my hair feels so much softer, looks shiny and healthy rather than dry and breaking at the ends. I use 3 x a week and will continue to do so to repair and restore my hair to health, vitality and beauty! Thanks Olaplex!",5,One,B00SNM5US4
"I am blessed with incredibly resilient hair but we all need a pick me up after a bleach job! I did a home bleaching (which you all know can be QUITE dangerous) over top some old henna. My hair needed a bit of a pick me up and Olaplex is honestly magical. Aside from the color, I wouldn't be able to tell I'd just bleached my hair. It's so so so soft and there are NO split ends! I literally can't believe how wonderful this product is!

I used it overnight. I got home, wet my hair in the sink, and ran the Olaplex through my hair. I started at the ends and worked my way up so I got a light coating up around my roots. I put on a shower cap and a towel over top to keep it insulated, and when I went to bed I put the towel over my pillow. I woke up and washed it out, and put a little bit of Lush's R&B on the ends before I blow dried it. My hair is SO SOFT now and not brittle at all. I am SO grateful that this product exists.",5,2,B00SNM5US4
"Do not buy this product. I read about how amazing this product was suppose to be so I went ahead and bought it. I have long, blonde (colored) hair. I tried the product two different times. I used it on shampooed, towel-dried and combed hair. I applied it with my hands and worked it through with my fingers. Hair started coming out on my hands so much I had to get it all off to continue working it. The amount of hair looks was ridiculous. I had already combed it and there was no hair loss then. My hair felt nice after the first time though although I saw new breakage. I waited two weeks and applied it again, leaving it on for 60 min. Hair loss was extreme again. This time my hair felt dry and the breakage is so noticeable that I’m throwing the Olaplex away! Horrible! My hair is so damaged and broken.",1,0,B00SNM5US4
"I know theres some debate over whether or not this Olaplex is legitimate. I would be upset if I did not have noticeable results but after even 1 treatment I’m impressed.

I put my hair through the ringer with bleaching and hot tools and the deep conditioners i use only improved my hair for about a day. After my first session of Olaplex #3 i noticed my hair was much softer, shinier and thicker. It doesnt have much of a smell which is nice since I wouldnt want my scented conditioner to clash with anything.

So whatever is in this bottle, it’s still pretty amazing",5,4,B00SNM5US4
"I have naturally wavy hair and in searching for products to take care of my trusses I found Olaplex Hair Perfector No 3 Repairing Treatment. I live in a desert climate and the heat makes my hair a little frizzy so wanted to find something to tame it. I dampened my hair, worked a small amount of the Olaplex product through my hair and went to bed. I rinsed my hair thoroughly (no shampooing) the next morning and Oh My GOSH! My hair is super bouncy and my waves are tighter than usual. I have blonde, very fine strands and this stuff doesn't way my hair down like so many other products. Olaplex is a KEEPER!!!",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"I’m so thankful for this stuff. I have fine, very curly hair with mixed texture. During quarantine I bleached my hair like 4 times and went from a level 4 dark brown to a level 9 blonde. I wish I had never even thought about bleach, it destroyed my hair. My hair now felt like straw and just would not air dry. I tried so many treatments and “hacks” before finally just buying this. For the first time my hair finally started air drying. It was the first time my hair even began to resemble itself at full health. I got about 3.5 uses out of it- my hair is just past my shoulders. The more I use it, the more my curl pattern returns.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"Compre este producto como solución antes de ir a cortarme el cabello dañado por la decoloración. Esta es mi primera experiencia y me siento muy contenta de que no tendré que cortar tanto mi cabello como pensé. Debe aplicarse con el cabello humedecido y luego enjuagar, lavar y acondicionar. Yo me dejé el producto por 1 hora más o menos, y si siento el cambio positivo en la primera puesta. Espero mejores resultados semana a semana.",5,One,B00SNM5US4
"I recently started beaching my hair, and noticed immediately that my hair now has lots of frizzies. I tried the most popular frizz products on Amazon to take care of that problem, and was disappointed to find that none of them worked properly.
I had used Olaplex No 3 in the past and loved it, so I tried it again. Am so glad it works pretty well on frizzies caused by bleaching. I use an amount of the product that will make my hair lay down without making it limp, and let it dry before combing it through with a fine tooth comb. I use it after every shampoo and then a couple of times each week. People compliment my hair and say it looks great. I really highly recommend this item if you have chronic frizzies.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"I am experienccing hair loss from this product. I have read some reviews of this product (too late) on the Sephora.com site and many women have experienced brittle and dry hair, clumps of hair in the sink. unusual shedding and breakage. My hair was in great shape until I tried Olaplex 3. I found out about this product on YouTube and it seemed to work on chemically relaxed hair. However, when I used it twice, the second time I used it, my hair snapped off near the front on both sides of my head. I couldn't believe it. There are so many complaints on the Sephora.com site regarding hair loss. I am trying to restore my hair with a lot of conditioning and oils. I think I will not be relaxing my hair again until 2022. Don't use this product without talking to your stylist face to face and not only get recommendations from Youtube.",1,One,B00SNM5US4
"I've read all the recommendations from Kim K regarding this product. Did some research and finally ordered it. IT IS AMAZING. Just one try leaving it on for 24 hours and my hair feels and looks amazing. Very soft and looks healthy. My hair is back to black after being over processed, during a color removal in the attempt of bringing black to some kind of blond. I fell in the hands of a sloppy hair ""professional"" who messed up my hair after seven hours. It was brittle, dull, ugly. Olaplex worked wonders and will buy more. Worth every penny. Get the conditioner also and the shampoo.",5,One,B00SNM5US4
"I love this product and feel it saved my hair. I over processed it and it was so dry. I kept this leave in conditioner in my hair. Anytime I felt the ends were dry, I’d coat them with this. My hair was breaking off but I feel this stopped it. It is pricey and I can’t afford it like I wish I could. I would have all 6 of the Olaplex if I could afford them. I had 3 and 6 but am out of them right now. As soon as Christmas gift buying is over, I will get them again. Don’t fall for the cheaper brands saying they are just as good. I bought one that said that and had decent reviews. The reviewers must had never used Olaplex as no comparison.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"Absolutely love this stuff!! My hair is very healthy already. I don't use heat products on it, I don't dye or bleach it, I trim split ends regularly, but I wanted it to be shinier and softer. This stuff did exactly that! My hair is so soft now that I can't stop running my fingers through it. It looks much more healthy and radient.",5,2,B00SNM5US4
"Pros:
- It does make my hair healthier and softer. Not an extreme change, but at least 50% better than it was.
- It does smells good. Although the smell doesn't stay in your hair when you rinse it off.

Cons:
- very expensive, for the size of the bottle and the amount of product you get.
- not convenient to use. You have to wash your hair before using (as most of us with damaged hair, use products to keep the hair manageable), then apply the product, wait for it to work and take another shower to wash your hair again. I wish Olaplex made a leave-in conditioner with healing properties that wasn't so time consuming.",3,0,B00SNM5US4
"All of my research about repairing damaged hair led me to Olaplex. I have used it once so far, and I am not impressed. However, that doesn’t mean it isn’t doing what it is supposed to do. I should mention I live in a very dry climate. I wanted shinier, stronger hair that wouldn’t break as much and would freely flow. My hair feels thicker, if nothing else, but in the way volumizing shampoo would make it feel. It seems to tangle worse than before, even immediately after brushing. Though the body is smooth, the ends are still frizzy and my hair clumps together in sections. I think a Keratin treatment is more what I’m looking for. I gave this 4 stars because it is probably doing what it should be doing and would be great for someone who likes volume, but I don’t think it is what I needed.",4,0,B00SNM5US4
"I have bought many hair products on Amazon and always was happy with whatever I bought until this. This cannot be the real Olaplex. It made my hair look and feel like a pile of straw and I could do nothing with it. I also felt a powdery coating all over my hair after I rinsed it out. Awful. I have long wavy colored dark blonde hair and after using this hair perfector I looked like I bleached and then fried my hair with a blow dryer set on high for 12 hours, and my waves were stick straight and gone. Stay away unless you know it is real and not some fake concoction like mine obv. is",1,0,B00SNM5US4
"Before, my hair was very wavy, frizzy, and damaged. I spent $400 getting a Keratin treatment and color, so I want to try to keep my hair looking gorgeous. After, I used Olaplex #3 my hair was absolutely gorgeous! I get my hair damp then I put it in my hair for an hour. After, I rinse my hair feels so soft and silky. Then, I use Olaplex #4 shampoo and it smells so good. I did try the #5 conditioner, but I don't like the smell. It smells like chemicals. So I use the Keratin Complex timeless color conditioner. Then, Olaplex #6 bond smoother. While straightening my hair I spray Keratin Complex daily treatment spray on each section of hair. Out of all the hair products I use I absolutely love Olaplex #3. If your looking for a hair product that makes your hair soft, silky, smooth, no frizz, and smells great then, definitely go with Olaplex #3 hair prefector It's the Best product ever!!!!",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"I am not sure exactly how to rate this, I have a natural grey - actually white -streak in my hair. The steak is a different texture than the rest of my hair, it is much dryer and tends to have more split ends. I thought I would try this and see if it could help that. While it did help on the streak, the rest of my hair didn't seem to benefit at all. In fact it was less manageable than before. That might have been due to the Olaplex Conditioner I used after the treatment and shampooing. I will continue to try the Perfector with my usual shampoo and conditioner and update as I observe the results.",3,One,B00SNM5US4
"I have been processing and bleaching my hair for 3 years now and just recently went as blonde as my hair would allow. My stylist did a fabulous job. However, I was not aware of the amount of care it took to keep bleached / processed hair healthy. I started having breakage around the neckline and went into a panic. I started googling frantically and considered all the drastic options. I have naturally dry, coarse, and thick hair that is relaxed as well as bleached... not sure how I even have hair left on my head after that sentence lol.

This product has given me hope! Olaplex no.3 IS NOT A CONDITIONER. It’s goal is NOT to condition or soften your hair, but to bond it. There’s a major difference. I apply it to dampened hair (split into 4 sections, using a large grape size of the product per section) and leave it in for up to an hour. Beyond an hour, the product has no effect and can even be drying. Do not leave in overnight. I am now able to comb through my hair without fear of it breaking off - this is only possible with a combination of conditioning and hydrating your hair after bonding it. I am able to do 5 different treatments out of each bottle. This product alone is GREAT, but I would suggest finding your perfect combination of products to support your hair type.

My combination that has helped my hair recover -
Olaplex no.3 (once a week)
It’s a 10, deep conditioner (once a week)
Redken Frizz Dismiss shamp/cond (once a week)
Pure Coconut Oil on dry hair (twice a week)
Paul Mitchell Super Skinny Serum (daily)",5,One,B00SNM5US4
"Let me start by saying AMAZING!
August 2019 my stylist completely fried my hair.
Not just one chemical damaging but 4 in 2 days. Completly fried!
I have watched my hair break in my hands, blow dried and the bathroom floor had more broken hair than i want to admit.
Cried my self to sleep, not knowing what to do.
Found Olaplex video from Malibu on facebook. I had 2 choices before this video. Shave my head or watch my hair break off, because no salon would touch my hair because it was so damaged, I was skeptical, but just from the first treatment of 3,4, &5
I had very little breakage, didnt have a shower full of hair, and only 1 or 2 strands after blow drying.
I am very greatful I do not have to shave my head.
Ladies DO NOT HESITATE!
This product saved my hair.
""Thank you Olaplex""",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"First, if you are saying this did nothing for your hair, your hair was already in excellent shape, period!. Now on to the facts. I screwed my hair up, haven't we all at some point? yeah, it was like hay. I used a new product and we have all been there when you can't look at it any longer and through your panic, you keep screwing it up. My hair didn't even feel like hair this morning. Once upon a time I went to beauty school as well and have destroyed my hair many times but never had I used a product once and it was practically back to normal. Yes, one time. Because my hair was so compromised, I really had little hope but seriously, after today, I will not go without this stuff. If you're like me, your not buying the whole pack. Good God, $200? no thanks. $28. Totally worth every dime! All I can say, is I am so glad I got this stuff. I have a trip coming up in a few weeks and I would go looking like Helga the witch woman. Day freaking saved!",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"Ok product, good customer service, however, shipping control leaves a lot to be desired. I receive a bottle that was barely 1/3 full. The company immediately sent a replacement that I received the very next day. Thankfully, this time the bottle was full with a seal. I was disappointed and quite frankly surprised that an obviously used bottle would be shipped to a customer. I've bought this product a few times trying to give it a chance to convince me it was a great product. While it was ok, I haven't been that impressed.",3,2,B00SNM5US4
"I wanted to try olaplex because my hair was dry/frizzy & I have dry scalp. I started with the #3 only & worked thst into my daily regimen. My hair started to get way more dry/frizzy than normal. It only got worse when I bought the shampoo. My hair was/still is falling out super easy, all I have to do is run my hand through it & I get lots of hair falling. My scalp texture must have changed too, because the dry flakes are slightly different, more clear & way more of them. Currently in the process of fixing my hair from this product & figuring out how to add moisture to the dryness.",1,0,B00SNM5US4
"I used this product on my 3c highly porous hair after getting highlights. This really did not do much for my hair. I did not notice any noticeable difference. I understand that this product is a ""bond builder"" and not a protein treatment, but I get much better results from my protein treatments with Aphogee products. When I use the Aphogee two-step protein treatment, my curls are super defined before I apply any product. Olaplex did not give me that result at all. Btw this product review is not sponsored by Aphogee--I just am sharing what works for me.

I gave Olaplex 2 stars because it had good slip in the application stage and smelled good.",2,2,B00SNM5US4
"Purchased this along with the No. 5 conditioner. The combination of products is a HUGE game-changer. This is a small bottle but a little does go a long way. I suffered from dry brittle ends and damage from heat tools and everyday styling (back-combing). I have very long, thick, course hair that is color-treated. After one use of these products I noticed a huge difference in my hair health. It looked and felt healthy and had shine again. Another two uses and I now know that I will never be without Olaplex. I highly recommend this product and am so happy my stylist introduced me to this brand. Another huge win, these products combat frizz and help with styling during humid weather. My hair no longer falls flat in the humidity! It really does seal the cuticle and help with hair health. I'm hooked!",5,2,B00SNM5US4
"My hair was severely damaged because of bleaching procedures. After reading a lot of reviews, I decided to leave it for a night on my first try. My hair was that bad, that I took the risk. This is what I did: I washed my hair, put 1/4 of the bottle and comb it, make a bun and put a shower cap (I also put a soft towel on my pillow, just in case.) Next day, I wash my hair and really noticed the difference. Completely worth it! Since then, I don’t have to use any styling tool to dry it and to go outside. It made a difference in my hair. Now, I use it biweekly or monthly because is too expensive (that’s the part that I dislike). But like I said, it is worthy.",5,2,B00SNM5US4
I cant say enough good things about olaplex (except I wish It was a little cheaper!) it didnt do much the first time I used it (left on my hair for a few hours before washing it) but after the third or fourth time I used it I could really feel a difference in my hair! I now use it about once a week or so. I have really thick hair so it doesnt last me super long but I will buy olaplex for a long long time! Buying from amazon I was a little worried it might be a dup product but if it is I have not been able to tell at all!,5,One,B00SNM5US4
"Olaplex absolutely worked for me. In two sessions, it restored my over-colored/over-heated hair to a more attractive texture and has strengthened it noticeably. My pictures show my hair brushed after drying naturally before Olaplex, then after a home-coloring and two treatments of Olaplex. I love that you can leave the treatment on your hair and let it work overnight and it doesn't leave your head greasy. The downside as many have stated is the price and amount you get (one bottle only contains enough for me to use it three times, and my hair could use more repair than that). I wish this product was more affordable so people on different budgets could treat themselves. Will I buy it again? Maybe once in a blue moon when my hair is especially dried out and when I can spend a little extra.",4,0,B00SNM5US4
"I’ve been using olaplex products for a long time & I believe this to be authentic.
I’ve seen reviews saying it’s not real- I don’t think that’s the case.
It’s a bit more expensive on Amazon but that’s part of the quick delivery. Without running to a beauty store there is no way to get it faster. Sometimes you’re in a pinch and have to bite the bullet.

As far as the product. It’s reputation speaks for itself. If you’re here it’s because you have read or heard how well it works somewhere. It holds up to its reputation. Especially the no.3",5,0,B00SNM5US4

"So I don't normally write reviews, but this product is so unbelievable I felt compelled to. I've had my hair bleached countless time over the past 4 years, and prior to that I colored my hair frequently with box dyes. I usually have a new hair color every few months so needless to say my hair was pretty brittle. Well I got my hair done (balayage) again about a month ago, and touched up the color with toner at home this week. Well after the touch up my hair was fried (I even used the lowest volume developer 10!). So I found this beauty of a product and decided to give it a try and I don't regret anything. This stuff Is AMAZING! Before using it I couldn't run my fingers through my hair because it was so dry & I was afraid of brushing it because I could just see it all breaking off and I'd pull heaps out of my brush. But after using this, for the first time since I started dying my hair I can run my fingers through my hair smoothly & I brushed my bed head out this morning with virtually no breakage and almost nothing ended up in my brush!
I only left it on yesterday for about 1.5 hours and only used maybe an eight of the bottle. I'm going to try leaving it on overnight next treatment to see what that does. This product is 100% worth every penny.",5,One,B00SNM5US4
"Horrible product. Every time someone complains about Olaplex not working for them and causing hair loss, there will be a 100 people saying 'it is impossible' as it worked for them. Well, it didn't work for me AT ALL. Caused insane shedding. I got blood work done to rule out thyroid or iron deficiency. I have no medical conditions that have caused this insane hair loss. I had thick luscious hair and now I have lost half of it. I am scared to run my fingers through my hair as it comes out easily and washing my hair is a nightmare. I stopped using it and now after 3 months, my hair is still shedding, though not as much as it did while I was using it. I read in other forums that it takes about 6-12 months for your hair to stop shedding after stopping usage. I couldn't return the product as I started using it only after the return window at Amazon closed. I DO NOT recommend this product.",1,One,B00SNM5US4
My stylist had used this on me before and my hair turned out great. I ordered here on Amazon and think I must have been sent fraudulent product. It made my hair come out after the first application. Please don’t order this product. Order from your trusted salon or Sephora.,1,3,B00SNM5US4
I tried it more out of despair than belief. Now I am believing in this product. There is nothing like it that repairs hair like Olaplex. I use now all Olaplex hair products and they are all excellent.,5,2,B00SNM5US4
"Used around 3 times and I dont see any difference. Im really dissapointed, all the good reviews and I got no results
I I left the product for hours and still nothing 😪
Instead I got amazing results with a $13 hair mask (Hydrating Argan Oil Hair Mask and Deep Conditioner By Arvazallia). Applied and left it in for 3 hours before washing.",1,One,B00SNM5US4
I enjoy using this a lot. Before I start washing my hair I damp my hair to put this on because I feel it covers more while using less product. I leave it on for an hour then I start to wash my hair with olaplex shampoo then the conditioner. I don't rinse the conditioner completely out. Once my hair dries it is extremely soft. I have been bleaching my hair for two months now (every two weeks) I am trying to get near platinum. I had natural black hair so you could imagine the damage from bleaching so many times however my hair is not damaged at all. I'm almost to the platinum so knock on wood everything will be just fine. This product though has been great for my hair.,5,0,B00SNM5US4
"OMG MY HAIR IS SO SHINY AND SOFT AFTER JUST TWO USES!
I have naturally wavy/curly/straight wild hair that doesn’t know what it wants to do and it’s also frizzy.
Now I can wear my hair down without heat products and it’s so silky and shiny! Game changer and obsessed already. My hair has literally transformed.",5,2,B00SNM5US4
"Is your hair frizzy? Is it dry? Does it feel like straw? Then you need to get this product right away! I'm not even kidding. It was first used on my hair at a salon and then I found out you could purchase it and I bought it immediately because it changed my hair completely. I wish I had a picture to show you but I don't unfortunately. All I can say is it works. It only took one time for it to work for me but I think for really difficult hair it might take two times to use, and then you just use it as needed or keep it up or whatever. My hair is so much more healthy now.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"The rumors are true! This stuff really does work. In less than a year I bleached my hair, dyed it black, bleached it again all the way to a beigey-white and Olaplex brought my hair back from the brink of glue. I did the same tortuous color change to my hair a few years back and had to chop all my hair off by the end of it, but not this time. It's been about a month now and my hair is almost ready to go back to my normal heat styling routine without fear of frying the ends.",5,One,B00SNM5US4
"This is the third time trying Olaplex and it’s just not doing anything for me. The bottle is so small and I have so much hair I thought, “maybe it takes a few times to see any real results” but I think it’s all hype. This doesn’t work any better than your average conditioner.",3,2,B00SNM5US4
"Over $30 for a tiny 3oz bottle so I expected something great. Not so much. Do not waste your money. Sure it conditions. Sure its moisturizing. But I have had others that were over the counter and they moisturized better, smelled better, came with more, and cost less. I have used Joico as well as Redken masks and they both did a better job, smelled better, and you got more for less cost. Overall disappointed with the bang for the buck.",2,One,B00SNM5US4
"For the price of this small bottle i had very high expectations, and it truly delivered! This is not a hair conditioner. As it says on the bottle, it is a “hair bonder”. I am 55 years old and I dye my gray Asian hair every 3-4 weeks. This makes my hair very frizzy and dry looking no matter how much I condition. After using this twice- I washed my hair first, towel dried it, applied olaplex and left it on for 10-15mins each time. Then I did a quick rinse and towel dried it again. I blow dried it and the result is just amazing! No more frizz and fly-away hair. That was 2 days ago and still looks good.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"Okay so I read the reviews and got mixed answers but ordered anyway cause well I’m impatient 😂 but I had heard not to order olaplex from Amazon and to order straight from olaplex because of a diluted product being sold in its place. I decided I also wanted to get the no. 7 oil, no. 0 treatment And decided to order a no.3 just to compare to this version. So I ordered those directly from olaplex because I found out they offered free shipping. The one to the top left on my hand that looks watered down is from Amazon the whiter firmer one to the bottom right is from olaplex. So from now own I will be ordering this specific product from olaplex directly. I mean they have free shipping anyways so it’s a no brainer! I still love me some Amazon but just won’t be purchasing this product from y’all 🙃",1,0,B00SNM5US4
"Try the Olaplex System, you will love what it does for your hair!! The hair protector is very nice and creamy. You do not need much as it seems to distribute well with running fingers thru hair however I comb it thru out of habit. I generally leave it in for 10 or 15 min and have a good read in tub while waiting however I have a friend who uses it over night and shampoos in the morning. Either way you will get a great result. I notice an improvement in my hair the next morning, it was much softer. Does not leave hair feeling heavy or weighed down. I can't speak to how it affects styling as I don't really do much with my hair. I will never go back to other products, Olaplex is perfect, leaving hair crazy soft and I have noticed there is less hair coming out onto my clothes or when I brush.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"I had bleached my hair so many times then dyed it black. Then decided to go back to blonde, it really took a toll on my hair. My hair was all strechy, i tore off if i wasnt careful while brushing after the shower. Also when dry it broke off onto my shirt while brushing seemed like if i had trimmed my ends ... was really bad. Ive used this treatment about 3 times and i am seeing the results... at the beginning it was like ehhh, second time was ehhh i can see a little something but not really, third time around, im seeing my hair looks way healthier dry, and when wet its elasticity is returning back to normal !!!! small bottle but definitley worth it !! also fyi i used this treatment once every week. Still using product at the moment!",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"My hair is curly and very dry and frizzy. This product was recommended and I finally tried it. Oh my goodness it is fantastic. One use and much of
The frizz was tamed. The texture of my hair was soft, I have never had soft hair. I noticed a shine. Never had shine before either. I do recommend using it each wash day as it doesn’t last between washings.",5,One,B00SNM5US4
"So disappointed in this. I followed directions exactly, and actually left it on for 4 hours with a shower cap to add extra absorption. Then shampooed and conditioned with high quality products. My hair was worse! Much more dry than before the treatment. My hair is color treated, but not severely damaged- just dry and in need of a trim, but I am done with this product. Not eligible for return, unfortunately. Live and learn I guess!",2,4,B00SNM5US4
"Miracle hair product when you use it the right way! After a ton of research I ordered this to repair my hair that had multiple coloring and was processed several times. Before Olaplex my hair was brittle with a lot of split ends. I could brush it and it would be tangled a few minutes later. It also felt limp and dull. I started using it after my last balayage in an attempt to preserve the length. Here’s what I did and what made it work for me:

- The bottle is small but if you apply it damp hair a small amount will saturate and cover all hair. I have long hair (mid-way down my back) that is fine but I have a lot of it and 1 bottle lasts for 8 once weekly treatments

- I followed Olaplex’s instructions for time which is to leave on 10 minutes. I see in other reviews that some people leave it on for hours or over night and that may work but I trust Olaplex’s instructions- they created it and know how it best works.

- I see a lot of negative reviews saying their hair wasn’t soft or silky after use. It won’t be with use of Olaplex alone which is supposed to build the hair bond- NOT condition. I leave it on for 10 minutes then shampoo and use a hair mask. That’s how you maximize using it. If your hair is damaged like mine you can’t expect one use of Olaplex to magically repair the damage that took sometimes years to create. It’s a gradual process but it is so worth it. After once weekly treatments and hair masks after my hair is fuller, has fantastic volume and body, holds style, is shiny and soft and doesn’t tangle. Bottom line is I will keep this product as part of my regular hair regime.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"If I could give this 10 stars, I would! After one use, my hair was completely different. I have dry, coarse hair --medium to thick --and in these pandemic days, it's become even more dry and damaged (because I haven't had it cut in nearly a year). I watched a YouTube video on how to use the Olaplex No. 3 and did it that night. I truly am dumbfounded that it worked that well in just one application. My hair is so soft and the texture is just amazing. Per the recommendation on Olaplex's website, I did leave it on for 45 minutes before rinsing. I wish the bottle were larger --I have a feeling I'll go through this quickly. I plan to use it once a week. Wonderful product --smells good, too!",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"I love this stuff. I typically put it on at night and let it sit until after my morning run - nothing drips into my face when I run. I sometimes put a small amount in my just showered hair and dry as normal. When I rinse it the following day, it is amazingly soft.",5,2,B00SNM5US4
"Though the bottle is small, and it doesn’t go a long way with my long hair, this stuff is amazing! I thought I would for sure need a haircut for my super dry and tangled ends but I left this stuff in for 30 minutes and it worked like magic! I made sure to use it after shampoo and before conditioner. I’m trying to grow out my hair so I’ll be buying more of this.",4,One,B00SNM5US4
"I like buying Olapex No 3 from Amazon because it comes faster than if I order from the company. I always use it after my hair is colored to help restore the bonds. I've used this product for a few years, absolutely love it. This particular product is silicone free, which I appreciate. For anyone thinking these are fake, buy 1 from the company and you'll see they're the exact same, both have a seal, same color, same consistency, same smell. A couple times the label from the company's bottle was a little crooked, oh my.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"This product works!! My very long nautural hair was bleached & dyed light Ash brown color and so the hair texture was destroyed & damaged!! It became brittle, frizzy, coarse & dry, no shine, tangly & unmanageable; my hair looked like a garden broom from the back. This product had such positive reviews so I gave it a try. I was so glad I did & would definitely recommend it to others who have damaged hair like mine. I used 1/3 of a bottle to saturate hair and left on inside a shower cap for 4 hours, followed by rinse with water, no shampoo since I washed hair a day but did conditioned & blowed dry right away to see the result. I rejoiced at what a huge difference it made. The texture of my hair felt like the one in a Pantene comercial...it became so soft & bouncy and my fingers glided down the silky smooth hair without any chocks of knots. I didn't even use a comb at all. Hair looked revived and healthy. The hair repair was so dramatic that I had to share a review on this product.",5,One,B00SNM5US4
"Olaplex is only receiving 2 stars based on the VISIBLE effect this had on my hair. Potentially it did ""strengthen my hair from within"", but that's beyond my capacity to assess.
Applied it overnight, but it did absolutely nothing for my chemically treated hair.
Shortly afterward I did the formaldehyde-free Peter Coppola keratin treatment - and got a new head of hair. I got so many compliments; ""You look so great, not sure if it's your hair or what..."" (And it was.)
However, the question remains: DOES it really strengthen the hair. I'll do my research on this, as keratin treatments don't actually prevent the hair from future breakage.",2,One,B00SNM5US4
"This is quite possibly the most amazing treatment/conditioning mask that I've ever purchased for my hair. I have bought A LOT of hair products and nothing compares to this olaplex. I was concerned at first that I would go through the bottle really quickly. However, you don't seem to need that much each time due to the consistency of the product. I use it about once per week. I notice a huge change after I use it. My hair is much more sleek and soft without being heavy or oily.",5,One,B00SNM5US4
"I had very strong, healthy hair, prior to bleaching it a few times. After the bleaching, my hair became dried out and brittle in certain areas. My hair is naturally curly/wavy and I typically let it air dry. After the bleaching, my curls/waves did not dry nicely at all - to the point where I was forced to style is and I was trying to avoid heat, due to the damage. After my first treatment with Olaplex, I immediately noticed a difference! My hair began naturally drying wavy/curly again and it felt immensely soft and silky. If you are suffering from damage and need something to help repair your hair, I would highly recommend this product. I am certain Amazon is NOT selling a fake product, unlike other reviews have stated. I also have very thick hair and there is still a ton of product left in the bottle after one treatment - that being said, the bottle is small but should last you awhile! Will definitely be repurchasing.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"I have platinum blonde bleached hair and I have been using this for at least a year and I will never stop. My colorist uses step one when she bleaches my roots and step 2 when she applies the toner. I use step 3 once per week. My hair is in remarkable condition considering the abuse I put it through. It doesn't feel like mush when it's wet and it doesn't look like cotton candy when it's dry which I see on a lot of bleached blondes. I think the recommended time to leave it in your hair is at least 30 minutes. I put it on the night before I want to wash my hair, leave it on overnight and wash it out in the morning. The results will amaze you!",5,0,B00SNM5US4
This product did absolutely nothing. It actually made my hair dry and flyaways actually were worse after using this. This will be added to my ever growing haircare graveyard. Complete waste of money.,1,6,B00SNM5US4
"This product worked wonders on my damaged hair. I could immediately feel a difference when I rinsed it out. The individual strands felt stronger, and my hair overall felt fuller. I let my hair air-dry, and my curls were bouncy and soft. I was also surprised by how little product it took to saturate my hair. I thought given the size of the bottle I wouldn't get many uses out of it, but I probably only used a tenth of the bottle to cover my medium length hair. I can't wait to see how great my hair looks and feels after a few weeks treatments.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"Olaplex 3 is a miracle worker. I used it , on damp hair. I left it on for 2 hours. I used Suave Clarifying Shampoo, just a quarter size amount. I didn't use any conditioner. I towel dried my hair with a cotton t-shirt. My curls were restored, hair looks gorgeous. I only applied about 1/4 th of the bottle. It works. I added some Suave mousse, and my hair is so shiny. I know there are cheaper versions of Olaplex, but definitely sticking to the real deal. I did not have damage or breakage before the application.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"I’m a regular user of Olaplex that my sister, who is a stylist, purchases for me with her professional license. She was out of town for awhile and I was out, so I ordered from here. First of all, it’s a very small bottle, and doesn’t last long with long hair. Secondly, it’s WAY more watered down than the product she gets me at her professional store, which means I have to use twice as much. It moisturizes well enough, but it’s honestly like half water, half product. I won’t be ordering this again from Amazon.",4,0,B00SNM5US4
"I have dyed blonde hair to base of my neck. I have been trying to use it sparingly. Got 4 or five treatments out of the bottle. Wish it wasn't so expensive. I do think I have noticed my hair has less breakage, looks a little healthier. Plan to let my grey grow out, getting lowlights soon to help it look gradual. I would purchase it again after my next salon visit. But then just keep it healthy with no more dying blonde. Blonde dye is better if you keep your hair shorter and get it cut regularly otherwise it is impossible to keep it longer and healthy looking. Don't like short hair!",4,0,B00SNM5US4
"This is the 2nd time purchasing this product. I usually like to try hair Products at different stages of my hair because they could work differently and yet again I am unimpressed. I’ve used it exactly as instructed. I have a full head of very thick wavy hair and this does nothing for frizz, moisturizing, nor softness.",2,2,B00SNM5US4
"I have been bleaching my hair intermittently for several months to achieve and maintain a bright warm platinum blonde. The color is finally perfect but my hair was wrecked from chemical overlapping and dryness. My ends were gummy when they were wet. I used this ONCE on freshly shampooed hair, left it on towel dried for 10 minutes, rinsed, and it's like I've NEVER bleached my hair it's so healthy! Now I have the color I wanted with the shine and moisture of my virgin hair. This is so worth the money.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"The product is an excellent source for volumizing fine hair. However, Olaplex could develop a product that is more moisturizing. Use sparingly due to drying out hair.",5,2,B00SNM5US4
"I""m not exaggerating - this literally saved my over-bleached blonde hair. I was thinking of cutting off my below-the-shoulder length hair. I wish I had taken pictures of my hair before and after. My hair looked like yellow straw before. It was stiff and would not curl. After just ONE treatment, my hair looked better and had a softness to it that it had not had in over 2 years. I've used it twice now and I bought the shampoo and conditioner so I think I will see even better results over time. Thank you, Olplex!",5,0,B00SNM5US4
My hair was over processed and I was left with crispy crunchy ends and some stretchy when wet sections. I applied some Olaplex on damp hair and let it sit for about 10 hours with a processing cap on overnight. This stuff is the real deal. I'm no mathematician but I would predict that my hair is AT LEAST 70% softer and my breakage has decreased significantly. This was only after one treatment. I will definitely keep using it and I'm sure I will keep being pleasantly surprised. I know other reviews have stated they thought they had received a fake product so to avoid this happening to me I made sure it was through a reputable seller who had excellent feedback.,5,One,B00SNM5US4
"I have thick, naturally very dark hair, usually when I colour my hair much lighter, my hair tends to dry out, become brittle and dull. This is magic in a bottle, using this product regular my hair is now manageable, shiny and super healthy. At first I used it once a week and kept it on overnight. Now I use it every couple of weeks and keep it on for a couple of hours or so. The longer you leave it on the better the results are. I also use the conditioner once a week, again another amazing product. As far as the bottles I received from Amazon, I can say these are the real product, I compared them to the ones I bought from Sephora and they’re identical.",5,One,B00SNM5US4

It's not a miracle one use thing for sure, but I already have high Hope's because with just one use I can see and feel a pretty significant difference. If you are on the fence, get it. It is small but you only need a little because it works through the hair really well. I have below shoulder length hair and I only needed like 3 dollaps (sp?)",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"This product truly helped save my hair. My stylist always dyes me a level 1 cool blue black, and I was ready for a change and thought lockup was perfect time to lighten my hair since nobody would see me. Well...lifting black is no easy feat, and I used a 40 vol quick blue double process and my hair was beyond fried. The frizzy photo shows how bad-this was after I cut about 6 inches off too! So many tears I was hysterical. I googled, and ordered this and used once a week overnight, in conjunction with the Matrix 1&2 bonding shampoo and conditioner. Just got back to my hair stylist about 3 weeks later (pic 2/3) and we did a roof shadow and a toner to smooth her out. My hair is still trash because it’s so short, but omg this seriously is amazing! I was at a point that I didn’t think I could come back from with the structure of my hair-it was like wet goo that never dried! Three weeks of religious use 1-2 times a week will BRING YOU BACK! You need this. It’s actually amazing!",5,0,B00SNM5US4

The results I've seen were after I used it for 2 months, about once a week.",5,One,B00SNM5US4
"I've heard about this brand for a while, and the repairing qualities. I use heat on my hair every day and it starts to take a toll. Since purchasing I've used this treatment twice - Once a week as the bottle recommends. The bottle is really small but you only need a little bit. It says to leave it on for 10 mins. I don't think I've actually done a full 10 min leave on but still have received results. It makes your hair softer, and more manageable and repairs the ends. It's the real deal.",5,One,B00SNM5US4

With slight trimming every 3 weeks and using this product 2-3 times per week for the past 6 months, the texture of my hair is really improving, and I finally am getting more length. I leave this product in overnight. The instructions say to wash your hair again after use, but I tend to leave it in until the next time I would have washed my hair otherwise.

"Have you ever gotten a hair product and hoped it would be the best remedy for your split ends and damaged hair? After buying so many hair products, it was hopeless to rescue my damaged hair, until I found Olaplex No. 3. This product is a great hair treatment product for men and women with damaged hair. This creation helps strengthen hair by repairing and healing each individual hair shaft with less noticeable split ends. This product has quick results and after 2-3 washes, your hair is noticeably healthier and stronger. It is also leaves your hair very shiny and soft with the amount of hydration it gives. Many celebrities like Kim Kardashian, Drew Barrymore, and Chrissy Teigen use this product and describe it as a “game changer”. Although the quality of this product is very good, it is not cheap considering how much product you’re getting. This product will help your split ends as well as relieve its thirstiness.
Many people might say, “Well is it a popular brand?”, it sure is! Many famous celebrities such as Kim Kardashian, Drew Barrymore, and Chrissy Teigen swear by this product. KKW Beauty owner, Kim Kardashian, says, “When your hair is really damaged, if you sleep in that, it really works. I notice a huge difference!” Kim Kardashian has gone from brunette to platinum blonde hair and expresses confidence in this product. Drew Barrymore has her own beauty company and she also uses this merchandise. She says, “And so quickly my hair is remarkably and clearly better. It's curling and actually bouncing and looking like hair rather than coughed up bird feathers….” She clearly states that she values this product because of how it leaves her hair looking. Chrissy Teigen is a firm believer in it since she colours her hair very often and says that it’s a “miracle worker”. Although many people may assume that celebrities are getting paid to say this product is good, other review of this product certainly shows that it is definitely worth buying!
Olaplex No. 3 helped me rescue my damaged hair with split ends. It is a concentrated at-home treatment that contains the same ingredients found in all professional salon products. It will fix split ends by relinking the broken disulfide bonds caused by chemical, thermal, and mechanical damage to the hair. This formula is made to work with various types of hair while reducing breakage and improving its look and feel. This treatment links broken bonds in the hair before, during, and after chemical treatment. This means your hair is actually being repaired and not just temporarily hydrated by using various types of oils with no parabens, sulfates, and phthalates, which are dangerous chemicals. This product not only brings life to your hair, but repairs it, which is why many people should buy this product.
Although this product is astonishing, it can be a little high-priced for the amount of product provided. When purchasing this product, 100mL is provided for $28. The reason that only 100mL is provided is because only a generous amount of this product is needed to coat hair in one treatment; no matter the length of hair. Only a small amount is needed to leave hair looking healthy. Compared to other treatments, this product is considered over-priced, but it is considered phenomenal. This treatment is definitely an investment for hair considering the price.
Olaplex No. 3 is the perfect hair treatment product for men and women with impaired hair. Now, one might say, “Why should I use this product?”, well, this product strengthens hair like no other treatment, while not only leaving hair with less visible split ends, but also repairing them. The effect of this product is impeccable with only 2-3 washes to produce healthy and hydrated hair. Many celebrities are advocates for this product such as Kim Kardashian, Drew Barrymore, and Chrissy Teigen. After constantly putting chemicals in my hair, this hair mask rescued my damaged hair by bringing my natural curly hair to life through a series of treatments. This product is an investment for hair and everyone with damaged hair should use it.",5,2,B00SNM5US4
"I have very unruly, thick, long wavy hair. It gets frizzy very easily and tangled. I put this on my damp unwashed hair and left on for 20 minutes, rinsed and shampooed. It was SO incredibly soft and untangled without conditioner. However, it did not help with frizz. I had to use my brazilian blowout dry oil and straighten it to remove the frizz. My hair feels amazingly soft now and healthy so I do like it for that. A little pricey for such a small bottle but it makes your hair feel nice.",4,0,B00SNM5US4
"I’ve used this conditioner for years now. It’s the best of the best and I try not to run out. I usually use this as an overnight treatment at least once a week, sometimes twice. I also will use a small amount before blow drying my hair.

Nothing else comes close.",5,One,B00SNM5US4
"I have extremely long and thick hair (down to my bottom) and I have had it bleached before. This stuff has made my hair softer and silkier than it has ever been before. It’s also much easier to comb and brush. I use foam curlers, and my curls are so much more lush and healthy-looking than they used to be. I only wash my hair once every two weeks, so that’s how often I use this product.

The ONLY reason this doesn’t get 5 stars is because of how little product you get in that tiny bottle. I use the entire bottle with only 2 washes, so I am constantly running out. If the company ever makes a larger bottle available to consumers, I’ll amend my review.",4,0,B00SNM5US4

I use it every 2 to 3 days to keep my hair feeling good and soft to the touch. I definitely recommend this!",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"I am usually VERY skeptical about these hair products that claim to magically repair years of damage. And there's plenty out there. In a desperate measure to fix my own hair, I decided to give this one a try and I've been pleasantly surprised at the instant results. With extended use, I don't know if it will truly repair my dry hair and split ends caused due to years of coloring and a disastrous perm but it has MOST CERTAINLY created a difference in just 2 uses. So I'm sold! Writing this review for the other skeptics out there. Maybe the results depend from hair to hair but it does work. It's more than I would like to spend on my hair maintenance, but with the results I'm getting, I'm willing to continue to invest in this product.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"I admit, I was initially a bit unsure about spending this much, but I've loved how it leaves my hair, so for me it's been worth it.
Just follow the instructions on the bottle to make sure that you coat your towel-dried hair strands well. There are plenty of how-to videos out there if you'd like to watch before your first use. When I first started using it, my hair wasn't in a good state and I let it stay in my hair longer than the minimum time. I've continued to purchase this and love the way it leaves my hair, along with the shampoo and conditioner, which I also started using. There's a reason why it's got a bit of a cult following -- it leaves your hair soft and smelling great.",5,0,B00SNM5US4

 I'm going to be completely honest. This stuff is no miracle worker but let me tell you. It saved my hair from looking like a solver wire sponge. You all have to be realistic. This isn't going to make your hair feel virgin. My hair was bleached twice in one sitting leaving my hair destroyed: brittle, dry, and horrible. After using this product the first time, I noticed it did something. I smell Olaplex 3 from Amazon and I have the REAL DEAL from Sephora and let me tell you they smell the same and work the same.

It doesn't leave your hair feeling silky smooth. For that you need some other product. Try Olaplex 6 and Olaplex 7 they work wonders. But don't expect it to return your hair to a virgin state. It just wont do that, at least not right away. It took me at least 6 treatments with all of the olaplex products before my hair looked less like a wire sponge and even still I need some hair oil.

Here is my hair before dying, and then before and after Olaplex treatment. Not the same as my virgin hair but not a wire sponge either.",5,One,B00SNM5US4
"Since we're dealing with COVID-19 I have been experimenting with my hair. Normally I would go to a salon for straightening, weave, bonding, coloring, cut etc. I am a cancer survivor with mixed race 3C hair. With help straight and smooth. I've colored and dusted my hair on my own. I'm using this product as my stylist would to keep my hair strong after processing it. I put it on damp hair in the morning, place in a cap, let it sit for 20 minutes and shampoo it out. This seems to be the same product I've had in salons.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"This is the greatest product I have ever used on my hair. I use a clarifying shampoo first then towel dry then put this on, wait ten minutes, rinse then shampoo and condition with my normal shampoo and conditioner. I have waste length hair and my hair has seriously not looked this amazing since I was in my twenties. My sister has shoulder length healthy hair. I had her try this and we were both stunned at what a difference it made. You literally get noticeably REPAIRED hair after just ONE use!! I strongly recommend the clarifying shampoo first though. That way you have no product residue on your hair and get the full benefit of the Olaplex.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"I have use this product 3 times by now and I can definitely see a difference my hair was so fragile and thin and dry, the first time It felt stronger but still dry, I went and bought some silicone free products (shea moisture) to combine and then did the treatment again overnight, the second time was better still dry but I could tell it was feeling thicker and shiny, there third time by far have been the best, I haven't seen my hair this strong in at least a year, I'm excited to try again I will buy again definitely to keep it healthy and also use silicone free oils and moisture... Definitely recommend it, if you use it the right way you will see a result.
Make sure you wash your hair before with a strong shampoo or rinse like vinegar to remove residue and you will see a better result in my experience.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"I have 3c curly hair I am in transition from dark to very light blonde. This has been a life saver!

I apply a generous amount evenly to damp hair, focusing more on the chemically treated parts. I put my hair up and let it sit for about an hour and then I rinse and follow with a deep conditioner. I have done this 2× a week and my hair has been able to keep its integrity throughout my transition.

I have even found that my curls are more defined and feel stronger than they did before I started applying chemicals.

Please keep in mind that this is not a deep conditioner, but it does help reinforce and bridge the gap between broken bonds in your hair's structure. There bonds are broken any time we apply chemicals and/or heat and the damage intensifies if you are not caring for your hair by giving it the proper moisture and maintenance. This Olaplex will help repair that damage but the stove ingredients do not provide the exact same thing as deep conditioners.

Also, think about this before you buy, as many people have complained about the price being so expensive for what you get. If you understand what, exactly, it does and can use it in a system with other products for your hair type and problems then I think you will find that it is a holy grail!",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"i've used it twice and i still have about a third of the bottle left (and i have a LOT of hair), and it seems to have done wonders already in helping my heat-damaged curls return to their natural beauty! got compliments from people about my new curl pattern that finally came back after 5 years. my only complaint is for $38 i wish it came with way more since it's recommended to be used 1-2 times A WEEK. if you can find the 8 oz bottle somewhere else for a decent price, invest in that unless you have the funds to purchase this two or three times a month until your hair is healthy as ever (but i get it, it does wonders so it's expensive but still ya know)",4,0,B00SNM5US4
"Awful! The reviews online about this product ruining your hair are TRUE. I have had olaplex hair treatments at salons before for extra shine and conditioning with great results. My hair has never had any color done to it so I solely wanted to use olaplex to help with split ends. However, it made my hair strawlike and so tangled and brittle just in one use. It undid all of my efforts of trying to grow my hair out and using coconut oil regularly. I am devastated. I threw this bottle out immediately. DO NOT BUY.",1,3,B00SNM5US4
"Very disappointed in this product. I have salt & pepper hair with white bleached and toned front fringe and bangs that needed repair. Used only in processed hair, left on for two hours, and the olaplex turned my grey roots YELLOW!!!!!!! Yikes! Had to use toner on my roots which was what I was trying to repair. 😑In addition, I did not notice any repair of the ends. Too bad since there are many reviews and salons that swear by this product.",1,2,B00SNM5US4
"As something of a conditioner connoisseur, I've tried virtually all the top treatments and conditioners for home use. But, Olaplex 3 outperforms them all. After two weeks of usage, Olaplex noticeably reduced my hair's shedding and breakage. Surprisingly, I'm happy with this product!",5,One,B00SNM5US4
"I've used this twice, once for 15 minutes and once for 90 minutes. The first time I just left it on in the shower, the second time I put a shower cap on over it and laid on the couch. I did notice once it was touching my skin, I felt a burning sensation on my forehead? Which is rare for me, I really never have skin reactions. So I put a towel in the shower cap. Both times I really didn't notice anything amazing, over the other cheaper hair masks I have tried. I have pretty damaged hair (or it was prior to me taking vitamins & using masks & good product) so I do see noticeable results when a product works. My hair felt soft, but it usually does after I shower.",2,0,B00SNM5US4
"I ordered this after doing research for my super dry and “crispy” strands after dying them red. It’s a very small bottle and I have long, thick hair that is also curly. I actually got 2, almost 3 uses out of it. I followed directions to a “t” and it seemed to help a little. However my ends are still crispy and they were just cut. I had high hopes for this after reading reviews but it didn’t do the job as well as I hoped.",3,One,B00SNM5US4
"All I can say is WHOA. I put this in my hair the min it was delivered.. I kept it in overnight as I read is ok to do. Rinsed it in the afternoon the next day and with that one treatment.. I'm already impressed. My hair was broken and so overly damaged being a blonde. It was snapping off at the root but I couldnt figure out why because its never done that. I couldnt eben brush it. After ONE use, and washing with the shampoo and conditioner from the same line.. no fall out at all.. not one piece of hair in my hands or my brush. I wish my bottle was bigger for the price, but I will keep buying this for absolute certainty!!!",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"I’m an Olaplex convert. I have virgin, shoulder length, relatively undamaged hair, but it’s always been prone to breakage, frizzy, and not as shiny as I’d like. I wasn’t sure if this would do anything since my hair didn’t have too much damage to repair, but wow....it’s shinier than i’ve ever seen it, no frizz even on a rainy day, and it just looks and feels healthier. Looks like i got a blowout without the damage. I use it once every week or two to maintain results. Definitely worth the money. I just wish i could find it in a larger bottle.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"I am natural and after getting color and my hair straightened my hair was fried. I was working so hard to grow it and it was finally looking and feeling amazing. After I got my hair done, my hair just looked dead. My hair stayed straight after washing it. After several different protein and moisturizing treatments, I could see my hair on some parts trying to curl but other parts were just straight. I just finished using this for the first time had to write a review. There is not one straight strand. All of my hair looks amazing. Its not like it was but it looks 1000% better. I just purchased more because I am confident my curls will completely come back with this. I may just do the whole line of products but we will see.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"This product is amazing. I have very long, undyed hair with decently damaged ends, a somewhat inevitable function of growing it for such a long time. Splits are a struggle for me, and in the dry winter air, I've been dealing with a ton of them, in spite of using various masks. I read a ton on Olaplex, trying to figure out if it would be right for hair that wasn't chemically damaged, as I know it is primarily used on hair that is dramatically colored. I just used it for the first time and left it on for nearly an hour, then followed with my regular shampoo and conditioner. I can barely see any split ends! I keep holding the ends up to the light, and it's like Olaplex almost cured my hair in one go. Highly, highly recommend.",5,One,B00SNM5US4
"I am a natural brunette and I have been Bleaching my hair for a few years and it has damage my hair. I’ve had immense breakage as well as split ends and frizz, the list goes on and on. When I first saw this product I thought it was expensive but in my head I thought it must be worth it! And boy was I right I’ve purchased multiple products from Olaplex And they have exceeded my expectations time and time again. I’d love to try their whole line eventually but I definitely recommend this product. There is 100% worth the money, my hair has been growing faster less frizzy, it really does cut down drying time and I have noticed less breakage and the ends of my hair looks so healthy. Once you put the product in your hair you automatically can tell the difference it softens the hair and makes the appearance so much better!",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"Completely over hyped. Not worth the price point, especially because I have huge thick annoying hair, so I literally used the whole bottle. The size of the bottle was probably 2x the size of the freebie shampoos and conditioners from like motel 6 (and that’s very much for $30)
Results: my hair exactly (tbh actually slightly frizzier which shocked me). I even left it on for THREE hours (regardless of the bottle saying 10 mins minimum). Bottom line:
Save your money, this stuff is not worth it.",2,2,B00SNM5US4
"This product works wonders on bleached, damaged hair. After going from jet black, to bright copper, to dark blonde, to light blonde in under one year my hair felt disgusting. Anyone who has bleached their hair knows what it feels like, it’s mushy when it’s wet and just doesn’t feel the same. This product made my hair feel almost back to normal, so much better than before. After one use I didn’t notice much of a difference, but once I used it several times it felt so much better. Even if you don’t have bleached hair but dye it a lot and/or used heat on it frequently, this product will help your hair feel better.",5,One,B00SNM5US4
"I honestly don’t understand what the hype is. My hair didn’t look or feel any different. I’ve even let it sit overnight, and my hair felt just the same. Maybe it’s that I have curly hair and this is better for straight? I’m not sure, but I’m not a believer in this product.",3,One,B00SNM5US4
"Works great on my hair. A few years ago I had badly bleached out hair that was falling out.
Stopped the blonde bleaching & with the consistent use twice a week , I did 30 minutes before shower. I also applied plastic cap or Saran Wrap and microwaved damp towel. As I said my hair was very bad. Now I use it once a week. My hair has responded. I had dyed it at a salon for decades blonde or blonde highlights. I also bought the bonding oil. Fabulous!!!! Leave in on ends very little and protects from my curling iron.
Takes time but you’ll see a difference!!!",4,0,B00SNM5US4
"I didn’t even believe this would work, but it does. If you have bleached your hair, or you use heat every day, color it constantly or perm or chemically straighten your hair, this stuff really does work. I’m shocked...and almost speechless right now. Oh, and, yes it’s a small bottle, but I used it for the third time last night and there is still another application worth left. In fact, I’m ordering another bottle right now.",5,One,B00SNM5US4
"Very upset. I spent years growing my hair and getting it healthy. I always air dry, highlight (partial) about once every 2 years. I finally had nice , long hair. I wasn't satisfied ""enough"" and tried this yesterday thinking my hair could be even healthier. I left on one hour, washed, conditioned and am recently waking to discover a TON of breakage. I lost 4 or 5 inches after using this product one time. I will never use again. Once was plenty",1,One,B00SNM5US4
"Everyone talks about this thing like it's a miracle so I just had to try it, and I was not disappointed. My hair is thin, slightly wavy, and very frizzy. No matter what products I use it's frizzy unless I straighten it. I followed the instructions on the bottle and let my hair air dry with nothing in it but a spritz of sea salt and WOW! My hair had the least amount of frizz it has ever had and was so soft, even my husband couldn't stop touching it. My hair is down to my shoulders and I used about 1/4 of the bottle, so $20 for something that will last me about four months (I only plan on using it once a month), isn't too bad. It's definitely worth the try!",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"Not sure if this is real or not. Regardless, I would not recommend doing this without a salon stylist. Used it once as directed. It did close the cuticle as it stated, hair shafts felt a bit thicker. However, my hair had no where for the oil to go that normally accumulates. So the end result was not thick lush hair as much as greasy hair. Natural ability for hair to absorb and utilize your natural hair oil is essentially removed. Will not use again.",3,0,B00SNM5US4
"I should have listened to my hair dresser when she told me the only way to get a legit product is from a professional or a supply store... waste of 28 dollars. I have severely damaged hair for doing a color correction. I recently started using Elizavecca cer-100 products. They work way better than olaplex and everything else I've used! If you purchase them through iherb.com they are authentic. And a third of the cost of olaplex. I purchased the leave in one, the wash out one and a deep conditioner one. They are awesome!! Just be sure to read the instructions from the iherb website, since it is a Korean brand.",1,0,B00SNM5US4
This all of Olallex treatment works well. I have the treatment done at the salon. They sell the shampoo and conditioner which is step four and five respectively. However I did not have step three. I use this once a week. I placed it on wet hair and leave it sit for 30 minutes under a plastic shower cap and wrap my head in the towel. So far so good. I have hair past my shoulders that has highlights and it seems to feel smoother and have less breakage. I would say this is authentic just the same as the ship that conditioner I purchased at the salon. Highly recommend it!,5,One,B00SNM5US4
I’ve used it once and it did make the frizz go away. I imagine the REAL Olaplex that isn’t watered down probably does a much better job. I’ll review again after the second use.,3,2,B00SNM5US4
"Honestly for the price, it has taken me a while to buy this. I really like this product. It’s smells nice. I noticed a difference after 2 uses. However the amount of product for the price, is underwhelming. I managed to get 3-4 uses out of the tiny bottle, because I stretched it. I also do not have long hair, though it is decently thick. If you have long hair you’ll be lucky to get probably 2 uses at the absolute most out of it. For a mother of two, dropping that type of money on a hair product is hard.",5,One,B00SNM5US4
"If you have damaged, fly away or dry hair...this is a great product. You need so little of this to make a big difference. Add pea size amts at time to dry hair and run through your hair with fingers. I start just above the ears and get mid section and ends. Whatever is left on my hands I use on top. This will last quite a while. I put it on for at least an hour before showering. I also use olaplex shampoo and conditioner. A little goes a long way.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"With #3, you get smoothed hair and long-term repair. The downside is, you have to use a generous amount of product to see immediate results. I don't use #1 or #2 but I'm guessing this works better when combined with those. The scent is great. I didn't find it as moisturizing so the 3rd time I used it I ""washed"" my hair with just conditioner afterwards and preferred those results. I did purchase #6 as well, which I gave 5 stars for instant, smoothing results and I only need a dime size of #6 on my long hair. My hair is colored but not damaged - I definitely recommend #3 for long-term help with damage and #6 for smooth results that make hair look better instantly and over time.",4,0,B00SNM5US4
Tried it for the first time today. A little bit seems to go along way. Only could leave it on just for the 10 minutes and not any longer and I didn’t get to fully dry my hair because I have two tiny kids who command attention. But even with that my hair feels much better and less damaged. I imagine it would be a lot smoother had I actually been able to dry it,5,One,B00SNM5US4
"I absolutely love this product. I use a dime size about in my hair after I shower every 3 days (not using as directed) I just leave it in and it has transformed my hair, I dye my hair a new color every 5 months or so and have to strip the old color out and had damaged my hair pretty bad.. after the first use my hair was noticeably more hydrated I have been using this for a year now and it’s a game changer.. if you bleach your hair you should be using this.. I buy a bottle every month.. 28$ for a month Is worth it.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"I was skeptical at first because of the price and the small amount of product you get for it. However, I have shoulder length, fine, fragile, chemically processed hair, and I use this 1-2x/wk, and it has lasted several months. A little goes a long way. It has a light scent. My hairdresser keeps telling me what good shape my hair is in despite how much we dye it very light. I credit Olaplex bond builder. This is a must-have for me. It’s worth the money but you have to use it regularly to see results.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"I made the mistake of bleaching the ever-lovin' out of my hair, so I've been looking for something to help it come back to life without going to the salon (not something I wanna due during our current global situation).

"I believe this is the real deal. I was skeptical ordering this on amazon, however my hair no longer feels dry like straw. My hair felt silky after I washed it out and the next morning my hair still felt soft instead of slightly crispy. I’m very impressed and will be ordering more when this runs out. I will say I only had to use a tiny amount for my whole head and it worked beautifully.",5,One,B00SNM5US4
"I’ve used it once, left it on overnight( which I have read over and over that it is okay to do) and the next morning washed it out and let it air dry. I did a quick wash and go but my hair was so.. lucious! So soft and bouncy so I am very impressed! That was only the first time trying it and I already know it will be part of my hair care routine for a long time.. **I HAVE COLOR PROCESSED HAIR THE HAS A LOT OF DAMAGE TO THE ENDS** great product!!",5,2,B00SNM5US4
"So like many of you, I was stupid enough to bleach my hair at home. Multiple times. My natural hair color is a dark brown almost black, and I lightened it to nearly blonde so I could go red. I loved the color but the damage, not so much. It’s been like 5 months since I stopped bleaching my hair and it’s come a long way, but I still get comments about how to deal with the damage to my hair. So I ordered this which came highly recommended. I also bought the conditioner. I left the product on over night and then woke up and washed and conditioned my hair. I definitely notice a huge difference both in the texture and appearance of mg hair: this is only after one trearment. I’m doing round 2 tonight and will probably do 2-3 treatments a week for a while. This definitely seems like it will help reduce the length I will need to remove. Yay!",5,2,B00SNM5US4
"I used this olaplex # 3 yesterday. My hairdresser recommended olaplex # 2 but that can only be purchased by hair salons. After leaving this bond repairer on my highlighted hair for 20 minutes I washed it out then shampooed and conditioned my hair with my normal shampoo. When I went to comb my hair I noticed large amounts of hair coming out by the roots. I was shocked at the amount falling out. Today I went online to read comments and found out that this has happened to many people. I threw away the remainder of olaplex#3 today. Fortunately my hair is not still falling out so I guess I was lucky.
Don’t buy this product !",1,One,B00SNM5US4
With first use I noticed an immediate difference in the quality of my hair. I do not relax or wash my hair without using this. I purchased a second immediately after my first use so that I never run out of this stuff.

I cannot say enough about this game changing product!!,5,0,B00SNM5US4
"I have been using the Olaplex salon products in my hair for a couple years now Everytime I bleach my hair. The last time I bleached my hair about a month ago, it completely destroyed my hair. So when I head about olaplex at home treatments I was super excited. I used this and I could not tell a difference in my hair. My hair is dry and brittle, with one use I couldn't tell a difference.

"I have been bleaching my hair blonde for 15 years. My hair hasn't felt like hair in 15 years. It felt like crispy straw. I had so much damage that I would brush it, and ends would break off. It was bad. I mean bad. I knew going into this that this was not a conditioning mask or anything like that, so I knew that my hair wasn't going to feel newly replenished after one use.

First use: I followed the directions EXACTLY as directed on the bottle. I left this stuff in my hair for several hours, shampooed and conditioned as normal. I noticed that I had less breakage than I usually do. I also noticed that my conditioner did its job better. My hair after one use definitely felt stronger and softer, yet it wasn't fully repaired yet. The bottle does say to use 3 to 4 times a week. This is necessary if you have severely overprocessed hair.

I have used this 4 times already and I am almost done with the bottle and my hair feels like hair now. It is so much stronger and healthier, and I am not experiencing any breakage. My hair hasn't felt this good in 15 years. It looks so much better too. I will continue to use this every time I get my hair done to undo the damage. Whatever they put in this works!",5,0,B00SNM5US4

Such wonderful results, people are now commenting on my awesome hair.",5,One,B00SNM5US4
"You spend a LOT of money for a product that you will get 2-3 uses out of. It seemed to my hair less tangly but I can't say that it does anything spectacular.

I have bleached my hair to the picture seen and it is now a bit longer (second picture) but feels soft and conditioned, when I use a comb or brush there is (and I SWEAR!!!!) never a strand of over processed bleached blonde hair on either! Since using this 2 to 3 times a week and leaving it in for at least an hour or more on towel dried hair. This stuff will make a huge difference.

I will continue using this 2 or 3 times a week until some of the damage grows out and then may scale back to once a week forever. I am so impressed with Olaplex. It is worth every penny and more.

I use it once a week and have seen a noticeable difference in texture and how it lays since it have started. The only warning I would say is that olaplex does wash out the toner. So I have to reapply a toner and 0 lift after each use.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"This is no joke. I went from bleached, icy blonde to a deep chocolate cherry red. My hair did not survive. I used Olaplex No. 3, left it in for 1/2 of a football game, washed it out with Olaplex 4 and 5. My hair feels so much stronger. Running my hands through, I don’t hear the pops of breaking strands. I don’t have clumps of broken hair in my shower. I’m in love! I finished with No. 6 and styled as usual. My hair is smooth, manageable and soft. It looks as healthy as it did before I ever started coloring it (20 years ago)!",5,One,B00SNM5US4

"This is literally worthless. Iv used this multiple times in my hair, my sister's hair, and my cousin. My hairstylist even used this and same the same thing. Those product is either a scam or a faulty bottle, because real olaplex has always worked. But yet this bottle didn't work on not only me, but 3 other individuals as well. Super mad I wasted money on this. Will tell everyone I know on the east coast to not use this product.",1,0,B00SNM5US4
"I was hesitant to use after reading reviews of it being a possible fake. I scanned the QR code and it brought me to the website. Granted, I'm sure there is a way to copy a QR code as well. I have never purchased olaplex from any place before, so perhaps I can't say it isn't FOR SURE, without a doubt, fake; but it isn't bad.

I did a quick test strand, left in on about 20 minutes just to make sure my hair wouldn't fall out or break (and I seen others say.) Once that proved to be safe, I saturated my entire head, using around 5 dollops. (My hair is a little past my shoulders.) I left it on a total of 2.5 hours, followed by shampoo and conditioning as per the directions. I personally noticed improvement from this first use alone. My hair was so dry and brittle on the ends from months of bleaching. It actually bounces now for the first time in what feels like forever.

I can't speak for everyone. But I will say, when in doubt, test strand!",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"I’ve used this one time so far but I saw the difference in my hair texture as soon as I got out of the shower. I left it in for about 20 min before rinsing out. My hair has been so damaged, it didn’t want to be it’s bouncy, curly self. I’ve bleached it many times over and finally saw the damaging effects. It was lifeless, straw like and kind of just limp. Also it tangled a LOT. I let my hair air dry and it felt soft and a lot less tangled for the first time in months! It was also curlier than I’ve seen it since June. Overall, super happy with the product. It’s a small bottle but using this saves me money on buying a million other products to tame frizz/ make it manageable. I used a bit frizz cream and I was good to go! I am going to use overnight this time like a few reviews suggested and see how that works.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"I am 63 years young. My hair is long and has never been treated with dyes just wash and wear. The past couple of years my hair has had a lot of breakage I am guessing due to aging. I have tried many hair products to reduce breakage to no avail. I was in fear of having to cut my hair short, no no no! As a very last resort I tried Olaplex No 0, No 3, No 4, and No 5 regiment. After using the conditioner I towel dry and add a drop or two of argon oil (be sure to use a wet brush). The breakage has stopped. My hair is soft, smooth, and not frizzy. I am so happy with the results. My hair is beautiful again.",5,One,B00SNM5US4
"I was stunned at how small this bottle of conditioner is - it's approximately 4"" tall. This tiny amount of conditioner does not warrant $26. It did nothing special for my wavy, colored hair. There are hundreds of better conditioners out there for this price.",1,One,B00SNM5US4
"This is NOT the same Olaplex 3 that you buy directly from the manufacturer or authorized retailer. I first purchased Olaplex here, then once I finished the bottle I purchased from an authorized retailer and that version is thicker, creamier, slightly stronger scented and has given me much better results. Almost seems as if this version Being sold is a watered-down version or something. It’s the same price other places for what works better—-don’t buy it here!",1,0,B00SNM5US4
"After seeing all the great reviews I thought this would at least *help* to repair my bleached and dyed hair and *help* with the split ends. One use and half a surprisingly small and ridiculously expensive bottle later, I’ve noticed no improvement. If you have thick hair, coarse hair, long hair, or maybe any hair at all, I’d suggest you try something else.

Info: “4c” natural hair, bleached and dyed, middle back length.",1,4,B00SNM5US4
I would say the Olaplex system is good but not quite the miracle worker a lot of other people have said it is. I’ve heard a lot of great things about Olaplex but I didn’t quite have the same result. I’ve definitely used other hair masks that I thought were more moisturizing & the conditioner didn’t leave my hair as slick and hydrated as I would like. Smells fine & has a good consistency but wouldn’t call it a miracle product.,3,0,B00SNM5US4
"This stuff is amazing. I purchased this because I burnt my hair with bleach and toner recently. My hair just started falling out and became elastic/stretchy. I was hesitant to purchase this because of the size for the cost and I've never used it before but it's worth every penny, this has truly saved my hair. I noticed a difference after one treatment. I leave this on for about an hour though. One bottle I would say should last me a month using it 2-3x a week, and my hair is past my shoulders. My fine, blonde hair feels stronger, softer, less snarly, shiny, and not greasy. I also follow up with redken anti-snap leave in conditioner for extra measure, both smell amazing.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"My hair is a mess, so this was a recommendation of a friend and reading the comments about it I decided to start using this product. I have been applied it after showering my hair and leave it on my hair for over an hour. When I removed it the hair feels soft but I didn’t see a big change tbh also I have noticed that I’m lossing more hair than before using it so I’ll suspend it and continue in the search for a real treatment",2,0,B00SNM5US4
"I heard about this product from a friend. She was having some highlights added to her beautiful long thick hair.
The hairdresser left the the foil in too long and fried the back of her hair, much of it breaking off. She used this product with incredible results...so, I decided to give it a try. My hair is dry, has highlights and wanted it to look more healthy and more manageable. After using this product, my hair looks healthy and shiny. My hairdresser also now use all 3 products on my hair. (#1, 2 and 3, when appropriate. It has no silicone or sulfates.)",5,One,B00SNM5US4
"This did Norhing to my hair.
When i got it directly from the mfg years ago it worked perfectly. Wondering if they changed the formula or if this seller swapped product.",1,2,B00SNM5US4
"I kept the mask in for 4 hours as directed by some hair dresser people I know, and it felt as if it was doing something, but in comparison to the mask I bought that was a fraction of the cost, I can see that it is not all that it is cracked up to be.",3,One,B00SNM5US4
"This actually works. I leave it in as long as possible. Usually I'll pick a day where I don't have to leave and just leave it on all day. It actually changes my hair texture! It's amazing. I wish the results lasted longer, you definitely have to keep up with it. Ive fou d that using very little is still very effective. I've used a lot, and used a little spread out very well with the same results.",5,One,B00SNM5US4
"Like many others I’ve been transitioning from straightening to CGM / Curly Girl Method during quarantine and this is one of my best product discoveries so far. Now that I know of this product, I’d use it no matter how I was styling my hair. Makes a big difference in the texture and smoothness of hair. Lives up to the hype!!",5,One,B00SNM5US4
"It's magic. OK, it's not magic, it's science and it performs.

It's authentic (I have ordered from Amazon as seller and from the Olaplex website). Leaving it on damp hair for as long as possible, then shampoo and a goodly amount of conditioner is incredibly restorative.

My hair is porous, it fades and it's not actually fragile but can get very dull and miscolored. This corrects that, softens my hair, sends frizz to the distant memory closet and adds shine.

Average thickness, but longer than mid-back, a generous amount of this means 3-4 uses.

It's so worth it.",5,One,B00SNM5US4
"Based on all the positive reviews, I'm assuming my bottle was tampered with. The product I received was in the correct bottle, but the substance was weak and watery with no scent at all. It did nothing to nourish my hair either. It seemed like almost straight glycerin with no moisturizing extracts or anything to actually nourish, just stuff to detangle. It looks like the first ingredient is in fact glycerin, though, so maybe this is just the product. I would go for the cheaper l'oreal mask or pureology or something stronger rather than spend money on this tiny bottle of weak detangler.",1,One,B00SNM5US4
"This product is absolutely AMAZING! After getting my hair dyed blonde and having it toned several times my hair was very dry and weak. I would brush my hair when wet and see TONS of breakage to the point that I was almost in tears. I read the reviews on this product and figured it was worth a shot and I am soooo glad I tried this! It is a life changer for blondes! I leave the product in for about 15-20 minutes 1X (everytime I was my hair) and the texture has changed! My hair feels softer and I can comb my wet hair out with much less breakage and damage. It really has helped salvage my blonde hair and I will definitely continue using this product religiously!
If you have blonde or damaged hair ORDER THIS NOW!!!",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"Been using this once a week for the past month and my hair is definitely getting stronger and healthier. It’s small bottle for just $28 but totally worth it! I’ll be reordering for sure.
Side note: I’m not sure why this product got so many bad reviews with people saying things like “it’s fake” This item is sold by amazon and ships from their warehouse, If it was from a private seller I’d be a little weary but this item is legit. Anyways I’m happy with my purchase.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"I’m not 100% sure but I think this product may be making my hair fall out. I have been using Olaplex #3, #4, and #5 for a few months and I began noticing more hair than normal falling out afterwards. I stopped using it as often but used it again recently and noticed the extra hair fallout again! Not sure if it’s one or all three of the products that are the problem. I’ve decided not to use any of it anymore.",1,One,B00SNM5US4
My results were amazing! I left it on for about 3 hours. I have curly hair and I air dried and then flat ironed and my hair felt so thick for the first time in years. It felt so healthy and moisturized but not oily. When I went curly again the same thickness was present and I hadn’t even used the product again yet. I have fine hair but have always had a lot of hair until I got pregnant and apparently my daughter took all my hair. I’ve been struggling with flat hair and this has made a tremendous difference for me.,5,0,B00SNM5US4
After I went blonder my hair has been breaking a lot and I thought about dying it darker but I wanted to see if this would help me. I know my stylist used it on me when I get my hair done but I needed some hair mask I can do once a week. I tried it today and it made my blonde frizzy hair so soft and manageable. I was able to let it air dry and not have to style it. I plan on using it once a week until my hie gets healthier.,5,0,B00SNM5US4
"Wow. I wish I would have taken a before picture. I had severe brittle bleached hair and terrible split ends. After using this once (kept in hair for about 4 hours), my hair was noticeably softer, less straw like feeling at the tips, and my split ends have disappeared...there might be a few hair strands that are still split, but for the most part they're gone. It seems like the Olaplex bonded them together. I heard that every time you use this - your hair just keeps getting better and healthier, and i'm looking forward to it and will use once a week.",5,One,B00SNM5US4
"I like the way this makes my hair feel, initially, but it doesn't agree with my scalp, and I end up having bumps on my head from it. Very expensive, and it seems that you'd have to use it all of the time. It's not something that seems to last. You would have to continually use it, instead of getting benefit from using it occasionally. I can't use it because I believe I'm allergic to it, so I wasted my money.",3,0,B00SNM5US4
"I have been bleaching my hair from my natural black to platinum for 6 years now. Breakage is my normal. I heard about this product and wanted to give it a try, but after all the other products I’ve tried in the past, my hopes weren’t up too high. I left it in for about 15 minutes and then washed it out and dried it. AND GIRL! THE RESULTS! Usually when I do my hair my shirt ends up looking like it lost a fight to a the floor of a beauty salon on a Saturday. To my disbelief, after I used this product for the first time, I didn’t have a single hair on my shirt. NOT EVEN ONE! 100% worth it!",5,0,B00SNM5US4
I used this once so far. My hair was dull dry and I was literally at my wits end of what I was going to do. Well I can’t say enough about this product. I left it it for 15 minutes and then rinsed it out. I don’t shampoo afterwards. Just something I was trying. This product saves my hair. I am going to leave it in for an hour or more today. My hairdresser said you can actually leave it in over night. This is a life saver!!,5,One,B00SNM5US4
I was so skeptical because fancy hair products are always so disappointing but I’ve used this three times as directed and my hair is completely changed! I noticed a difference after one use but every time I’ve used this I feel like my hair looks better and better. I started using this along with the number 6 leave in treatment so I don’t know how this does by itself but I will continue to purchase!,5,0,B00SNM5US4
"i decided to try this product because of all the good reviews, after trying this once i felt the difference in my hair , softer and its starting to look like it did before the chemicals, it is expensive, and i do hope they can make bigger bottles,
but i will continue using,

i now use in on my hair after i wash it, like a leave in, JUST RANDOMLY TRIED IT LIKE THIS, and it made my curls stay soflty intact, a little backround my hair was naturally thin curly dark brown and i went blonde for about 5 years so it does not curl up the same, i now am back to black, hoping my hair gets its life back (the curls and length), lets see if this product helps the process. :)",4,0,B00SNM5US4
"I have been using thurs for many months now. My hairdresser puts Olaplex into my dying/ bleaching sessions & I use this Olaplex 3 at home for upkeep in between my salon sessions. It has made such an incredible difference un my hair. It's so much stronger, shinier, healthier!!! I'm so glad my hairdresser introduced me to this product as I get my hair processed & bleached so much THIS has been a lifesaver I would only use it if you've have the Olaplex treatment done to your hair already like 1 & 2 if not its not worth just buying the 3 & expecting to see a difference & also make sure you use it at least twice a week!!!",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"#3 is a great product. I use it on dry or wet hair anywhere from 15min to overnight. I have very long wavy/curly hair so detangling is the most important to me. The bottle is small so I might get 2 uses out of it. I also use the shampoo,conditioner and leave in. I recently got the # 0 but don’t know if this is needed. It really transformed my hair and helped with the stress I usually have in wash day.",5,0,B00SNM5US4

This being said, any colored hair takes a beating and this is a great way to show your locks some love! This sticker price seems like a lot, but this stuff actually delivers! I applied this after a color and rinse then left it on over night. My hair looks good as new and feels silky soft. I also love that it doesn’t leave my hair greasy during application or after washing out like other masques have in the past.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"I'm very satisfied with my Olaplex #3 purchase, it is legit and it works! I've noticed changes in my long, past shoulder length, 3A (natural spiral curl) hair. I've noticed some breakage, possibly due to me wearing my hair in topknots everyday. I've got dry hair and split ends, since using my hair actually feels thicker and stronger, and that 3 uses in in 3 weeks.

I remember trying this project a couple years ago and I didn’t love it it was the bad but I didn’t love it I thought it was not worth re-purchasing. However I thought I’d give it another go this time around I really love this stuff it moisturize your hair it gives you your curl pattern the only downside here is the price. Pricey but worth it. I have 4c curls and my hair is constantly dry. This product actually helps! Will be re-purchasing I get the hype now!,5,0,B00SNM5US4
"I have always disliked the texture of my hair. It always, no matter the product I used, felt dry and frizzy. Now it's winter time which makes it way worse. After watching some Brad Mondo videos, I just decided why not try this since I had lighter ends but virgin roots and mid tones and stuff, and I will now always have this stuff. My ends feel so much softer, my hair shines, I dont have near as much frizz as before. This product is a miracle product on my very dry, heat damaged hair. It does make my shoulders itch when I use it, so I can't always keep it in the whole time, but even then, it works awesome. I'll be buying more on my next payday.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"This product is worth the hype.
Read the instructions: my first use was not so hot as I didn't see that it was to be applied on DRY hair before you wash it. I've left mine in from 20 - 60 minutes. When you rinse it out you can instantaneously feel the difference and I'm talking about before you even shampoo. I have chemically straightened hair with colour and bleached highlights. My hair only looks normal today because of this product.",4,0,B00SNM5US4

I used most of the product by now and found it helps my hair but not a huge amount. I have moderately damaged hair and it has greatly improved the appearance for a short while after each use which is fine. The feeling of my hair before using was very close to the result after each use. I found that buying directly from the site would probably bring better results in both appearance and feeling of the hair. I still rate it four stars because it did help in appearance very noticeably.,4,0,B00SNM5US4

"This product is amazing! I purchased this for my daughter (and used along with No. 4 Shampoo and No. 5 Conditioner) who's hair was extremely damaged from a salon visit. She had her hair bleached 3 times in 24 hrs (2 differ hair appts) in order to lighten her medium brown hair to (almost) platinum blonde so that she could achieve pastel pink hair color. Unfortunately, the hair dresser had no idea what she was doing, which resulted in straw like texture and uneven color (not extreme breakage yet, but wanted to prevent further damage). After 1 use of all these products (No. 3/4/5), her hair was transformed!!! It was soft and was visibly healthy. We left No. 3 treatment on for 2hrs. and followed up with No.4/5. We did a 2nd treatment with all three products a few days later, leaving No. 3 treatment on for 4hrs and followed up with No. 4/5. Again, so soft and healthy looking. We will continue treatment 2x/week to keep it strong and to prevent breakage. The smell is clean and light - for all 3 products.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"This product is trash. I have 3c hair and it’s completely natural - no relaxers, no color. 2 days ago, I got a trim and decided to use the product for strengthening. Yesterday, I applied it for 10 min and washed it out. Then I applied lots of coconut oil and wore it naturally for the evening. Today I noticed it was super dry and brittle. So I decided to wash it completely out with my aveda shampoo and conditioner. When I brushing my hair with the conditioner in it, I noticed short pieces of my thick hair in my hands. It clearly caused breakage to my healthy hair. Hoping this is the worst of it. I will never use this product again, and to many other reviewers’ point, I will always order a hair product directly from the manufacturer. This also had a weird and intense chemical smell akin to a relaxer. If you have natural hair, don’t use this.",1,0,B00SNM5US4

"I’ve heard nothing but good things about Olaplex HOWEVER I had some typical breakage from being blonde and figured I’d use this to help. I have naturally curly hair and now after using this twice a week for about 2-3 weeks if I don’t straighten it, I look like something you pull out of a drain! The mild and typical damage I had from bleaching is now INSANE. I’m not sure if this stuff isn’t real but I’m just praying these effects wash out over time.

- my sister started using this the same time I did, from her own bottle and is now having the same issues :(",1,One,B00SNM5US4
This is perfect for what I bought it for. I had to bleach my hair and was advised this would help from breakage and drying. It worked wonders. I would definitely recommend if you are looking to bleach your hair. I just popped a decent amount in the bowl with the bleach and put it on my hair. Hair feels great. Now the product on its own works well too but my hair is already oily so I only use it on the ends but it still makes my hair a little too oily. I will probably use it as a mask and rinse it out the morning after.,5,One,B00SNM5US4

"I’ve been using this product for years and I will always stand by it and I constantly recommend it to everyone. However, it is important to note that this product works best if you’re already using other products that are good for your hair such as sulfate free shampoos and deep conditioners. Nonetheless, this is what will make your hair soft and silky after several rounds of bleaching, breakage, permanent and semi-permanent dyes, lighteners, and toners.

note: olaplex won’t fix your hair or the damage done to your hair as only cutting it off permanently can give you the healthiest hair, but olaplex will help to build the bonds in your hair so that it doesn’t split and break.",5,0,B00SNM5US4

I usually apply, and then leave on while I go to the gym/run errands (over 2 hours each time). Wash and condition as normal and my hair looks unbroken and super shiny!",5,2,B00SNM5US4
"The first time I used it, I only left it on for like 10 minutes and it didn’t do much, plus I did it in the shower when my hair wasn’t really towel dry like the instructions say. Mind you, my hair is severely damaged from bleaching it (5 times in one night lmao) to white, then eventually dying it brown, pink, bleaching it again and dying it brown. The next time I did it, I towel dried, put it all over evenly, and left it on for like 4-5 hours. My hair is drastically healthier and feels better.
TIP: Switch between this and a hydrating product. You don’t want to use a protein treatment too often, or a hydrating product too often. I’ll probably do this once a week and another hydrating one once a week on another day so I can eventually get my hair healthy again.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
Not fake. I was skeptical to purchase because of reviews. But I received genuine product. I also purchased shampoo and conditioner those were authentic as well. Makes hair feels super soft and healthy. I leave it on 2 hours or more. I have really damaged hair that has become dry frizzy from all the bad coloring jobs i gave to myself. This has helped it be less unruly. Even for my stubborn greys. Side notes. I use it three times a weeks and leave on for 2 or more hours and it has done wonders.,5,0,B00SNM5US4

But I loved the product! It made my hair extremely soft when I was washing it out and it seems slightly healthier! The first time I used it, I messed up though. Apparently when using this, you need to wash it out with a low poo or shampoo and deep condition. I didn't and my hair looked aweful. It was frizzy and flat and wouldn't curl right.

"First: definitely use a Clarifying shampoo. I actually used Dawn dish soap (it is gentle and works great) lathering up & rinsing twice before applying Olaplex 3. I was only able to leave product on my hair for 20 minutes but after rinsing, shampooing and following up with my usual leave-in conditioner, I let it air dry while lying down, not even attempting to style it (lazy day).

"I found out about this product through my hair colorist. He applied it on my hair and insisted I bought some for follow up applications. The difference it makes in my hair is like night and day. I was tired of buying all kinds of hair products that promise all kinds of miracles. Non of them work, unless I use Olaplex. It should be used once a week but I do find the process time consuming. First, you must wet your hair. Towel it dry. Apply Olaplex. Wait at least 10 mins (I leave it on for at least 20). Then wash and condition as usual. My hair feels a lot better after rinsing the product out. That's how good this product is.",5,5,B00SNM5US4
"So I've used Olaplex in the past every time I've gotten my hair bleached. Normally, you get this product (as the third step to olaplex) from the hair dresser after your coloring session to take home. This time I went to a new stylist and she says she used Olaplex in my color but I never received this step to take home. She actually damaged my hair so much, I was devastated. I decided to order this in hopes that it would bring it back to life. I used it 2 times each week for 2 weeks now, and wow what a difference! I am so happy I did. It is expensive, I have medium length hair and use about a quarter size of the product. Its worth it, I definitely highly recommend it.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
I recently bleached my hair and trust me my ends were not happy. I decided to give this product a try and it helped. I do feel that the previous reviews on this product gave me an unrealistic idea of what this product would do. It honestly just feels like a deep conditioner. Thats all.,5,2,B00SNM5US4
"I do not think this is real Olaplex! I’ve had Olaplex used on my hair in a salon a few times and as a blonde I could tell the difference. Using this on my hair and left it in for the amount of time it said to and it DID NOT make my hair soft, conditioned, or add any more moisture than it already had. Really disappointed I spent $30 on this. WILL NOT BUY AGAIN!",3,One,B00SNM5US4
"This product has made such a big difference in my color treated hair. I’ve found it has the greatest impact if I mist my hair with water until damp and combine the Olaplex with another beneficial hair oil, comb through gently, and sleep with it. I have long hair so I braid my hair to sleep so less messy. However, you don’t have to use a ton to the point that your hair is saturated. The next day I wash out, shampoo and then condition.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"If you’re on the fence about buying it like I was - but it. I bleached my naturally dark but also box dyed dark hair 5-6 times over a 4 month period and by the last time my hair was dead. It had the funny feeling when wet, took FOREVER to dry, and get stringy and gross when I ran my fingers through it. I’ve used olaplex only TWICE so far (I think I’ll be able to get 5 uses out of this bottle and I have a decent amount of hair) and it feels so much better. The first use I left in for about 4 hrs and the second I left in over night. My hair dries much faster, doesn’t feel gummy, and looks a lot more shiny. If you want an extra supplement to this or if you don’t wanna spend the money on this I’d recommend the whole total repair 5 line by L’Oréal.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"It was good, I used it twice about a week apart in preparation to highlight my fairly damaged hair.
It definately helped. I'd say if anything though, mix it with a Protein Neutralizer. You can get a 4oz bottle at Sally's Beauty Supply. You MUST leave it on your hair for at least 20ms. I'd suggest a plastic cap and a hit towel over it too, so it penetrates better. You can color/highlight immediately after rinsing it all out and letting hair air-dry.",4,0,B00SNM5US4
"I honestly love this stuff. Granted it’s expensive and I only get 2.5 uses out of one bottle. I had fried my hair with bleach and could barely even run my fingers through it, after 1 use of olaplex it was not completely repaired but WAYYY better and very moisturized. After 2 uses I could run my fingers through my hair again without causing more breakage. I have purchased 3 bottles because I feel I keep benefitting more and more from it. Definitely recommend if you have colored/bleached hair.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
I’ve been getting highlights for 8-9 years and recently the bleach had just taken an awful toll on my hair and it just was breaking and in a bad state! I had heard a lot about this so I tried it out and it just transformed my hair from brittle and broke back to healthy and thick! I leave it on overnight before I was my hair and it truly makes it so soft and healthy feeling! I think everyone needs this in their hair are lineup!,5,0,B00SNM5US4
I am not usually write reviews.. after debating if get this product or not.. I decided to give it a try.. I used 1 bottle for 1 month my hair is hydrated and less freeze!! My ends are silky bc they used to be like a mop!! :). So happy that I am going to buy a new bottle to used it again... I didn’t have any falling hair.. and I don’t think the product is fake was sealed!!,5,0,B00SNM5US4
"if i goto the olaplex site, the bottle says ""take home"" just like the one here. I have used it twice and in both times, i left it on for over an hour, then washed my hair and conditioned it, once with a hair mask and once with just a daily conditioner and both times, my dyed hair came out exteremely soft. I swim as well so my hair is always severely damaged. i will buy this again",5,One,B00SNM5US4
"I have bleached curly/wavy hair that is relatively fine, prone to breakage and feeling brittle. This product is an absolute game changer!! Before using, my hair felt sort of straw like and rather unpredictable but afterwards it feels 100x softer, more manageable, and looks less dry! My flyaways decreased so much and my hair is the smoothest it’s been since I began dying it years ago! I could not believe how wonderful and revived my hair looked after just one use! I have tried tons of other hair masks, conditioners, and treatments that claimed they would improve my hair but none have even come close to the results I got with Olaplex! If you are debating trying this product or have reservations due to the price, this is your sign to click the button and buy it because it is worth it!!",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"Omg.....I love this stuff! My local salon charges $40.00 per treatment for Olaplex. Although this bottle is small, it's powerful. The shorter your hair is, the more use you'll get. My hair is shoulder length and I'll get probably 3 or 4 full treatments with it. I put in my first treatment overnight and my hair was much, much softer and healthier looking. I get my hair bleached every 8 to 10 weeks so I needed this.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
My blonde hair was fried at a salon recently and a friend recommended this product to help restore moisture and repair some of the horrific damage done! I have used it 3 days so far and love it!!! Where has this product been all my life? I came to the conclusion that I was just going to have to desk with my dry brittle damaged hair if I wanted to continue to color my hair!,5,0,B00SNM5US4
This is the best conditioner! I can’t believe how much it calmed my frizzy gray hair. I was afraid it might be too heavy. But it actually gave my hair so much volume and shine. It looks as lovely as it does when I leave the salon. I took another reviewer’s advice and used a clarifying shampoo before I applied the conditioner. I think this is especially important if you have well water.,5,0,B00SNM5US4
"love this product, Ive had some kind of damage from an unknown source of product. I had virgin hair, but my curls were dull, stringy, no pattern, frizzy, wirey, straight. My scalp was itchy and I had flakes unlike ever before. This is helping me get back to normal. I hope it continues to improve. First application was ok, second had better results. I now have some shine and curl pattern is beginning to look better.

"My hairdresser recommended this, and it doesn’t disappoint. Don’t expect an overnight miracle. This is a treatment that builds the bonds in your hair over time. I color my hair regularly and had been trying to grow it out with little success. Over the past year I’ve used this as well as Numbers 1 and 2 when I go to the salon, and my hair has become thick, healthy and long!",5,2,B00SNM5US4
"I was expecting this product to be effective as it said on reviews online that is used at hair salons but I honestly think is nothing but some sort of conditioner diluted with water it even made my hair fell and brake a little more than usual, I also ordered another product for like $5 and worked better than this one. It could have been just me but I wouldn’t order it or use it again.",1,One,B00SNM5US4
"Amazing product. Bought it 3 times by now and will keep on buying it. The best thing for my damaged hair. Dont buy other products! The other products may be cheaper but I swear comparing to this product none of the other products work! Even those products I thought they work, comparing to this one they really dont! 100% worth it!!!",5,One,B00SNM5US4
For a while I thought this was what the product looked like until I ordered some more from the olaplex website and saw a huge difference with the consistency of the product. In the image you'll see a watered down version of the product versus the real deal with a thicker consistency. Sort of like conditioner. I highly suggest just buying this product off of the official website to save from being ripped off.,1,0,B00SNM5US4
"I heard great things about Olaplex and seen 10000 videos before purchasing, and I don’t regret! The magic is real, my hair was badly damaged after bleaching several times. Have been using Olaplex once a week for one month already and I’ve seen great results so far!",5,One,B00SNM5US4
"Like the product says, it’s not a deep conditioner. It’s not going to leave your hair silky smooth and soft. It’s meant to reform the shattered and broken protein bonds in your hair. I bleached my dark, asian hair twice into a platinum blonde. Understandably so my hair was severely damaged and breaking off my head if I even brushed it too hard. So I bought olaplex and I’ve only used it for a one hour long session so far. I’m not kidding when I say after I finished washing my hair, my hair felt stronger than before. Maybe not to its original state but at least my hair wasn’t falling out. It did make my hair feel a lot less crunchy but I can’t tell if it’s the olaplex or the conditioner I love to use. Im hopeful that with another or two sessions of olaplex, my hair would be close to its original strength. For now Im very happy with the results. My hair isnt falling off my head even when Im a little more rough when combing. I dont see a lot of split ends, and Im hopeful of how my hair will turn out with more sessions.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"I live on an island and I spend every day at the beach, so my hair is of course very dry. I decided to try Olaplex, even though honestly I didn't have much hope, however, it really worked. I can't say it did wonders, but it did moisturize my hair, it really does look and feel better now, much softer. Whatever product you buy, don't expect it to change your hair completely, it cannot happen. But you can improve it a bit and prevent breakage by hydrating, so Olaplex is definitely good for that. I would buy it again.",5,One,B00SNM5US4
Great product that gives a nice healthy boost to your hair. I am currently transitioning to curly hair. I just got my second big chop and I massaged this into small sections throughout my wet hair. I left in in for about an hour then washed regular and it made my curls POP. My mom likes her straight hair and she blow dries her hair frequently. She has put this in her hair 3 times with a few weeks in between and her hair looks visibly healthier and and stronger. The bottle is enough for 4 times of use if you have medium amount of hair. I believe for thinner hair you can make it up to 5. I would recommend this to anyone!!,5,0,B00SNM5US4
"I used this for 6 weeks and I have to say I am not impressed. I got my hair highlights for a pretty light shade (caramel) and was hoping to restore the softness and shine. This product was similar to an average conditioner.

Given then you have to use this product on your head for 10 extra minutes about washing your hair add additional complexity in application. And yet, the results aren’t desirable. I have compared this product with Costco brand (Kirkland) conditioner and the Costco product was much better in results.

It’s not worth the money.",3,0,B00SNM5US4
It’s just regular hair conditioner. There’s absolutely nothing amazing about it. I have bought better conditioner at the grocery store. Definitely not worth $28. If you’re looking for an amazing conditioner try Davines,2,2,B00SNM5US4
"WOW THIS SH!T ROCKS!!!!!

My hair is dry, damaged and desperate. This is the only treatment outside of the salon that I actually feel like made a visible difference immediately. I was on the fence about ordering for the price but it’s about ~5 treatments.

Go online and watch a few application videos to make sure you get the most out of it (ie. Use plastic bag / shower cap once applied to heat up your hair)",5,One,B00SNM5US4
My hair is super straight and tangles easy and requires a lot of conditioner. My hair is fine and ends seem dryish and can be frizzy after drying. This stuff worked great on my hair. I was worried it would make my hair at roots very greasy looking specially being a blonde but it didn't. Seemed smoother and less frizzy after using. I was shocked tho when I opened the box bc I guess I didn't read how small of quantity the bottle was. The pic made me think it was bigger. You can see the actual size in the pic in my hand included.,5,0,B00SNM5US4
"This was pretty “meh” for me. After all the great reviews I’d seen, heard and read-I was excited to try this product. I’ve had my hair lifted from a level 7 to platinum for multiple years along with working on growing it longer. While I think it helped my hair “feel” better to my touch, I don’t think it “repaired” anything or helped strengthen my hair any more than a great leave-in, protein, oil (or even coconut oil) treatment did.
For the money, I’ll stick with a salon treatment from a line that uses more natural ingredients.",3,0,B00SNM5US4
"My hair is in relatively good condition. I never blow dry or heat style but it’s longer than ever bc I’ve avoided salons through the pandemic. I was lured by the hype.

"Important to know that this is not a conditioner and it will not make your hair softer by itself. You would need to use the complete line of products that Olaplex has to offer.

I buy this from the manufacturer all the time and just wanted it quicker this time so I ordered it and when I received it I knew right away that it is FAKE....it’s so watery (not like the real product) The labels are exact but the actual product is NOT.

"Bought this product for my mom who wanted to try it out. This is purely from her experience using this product. It moisturizes the hair as well as treats it fairly well.

I was a little hesitant about buying it because I wasn’t sure if they catered to my hair type. The directions say to apply the treatment before shampoo but I applied it last after I deep conditioned. Since I have low porosity hair, I wanted to apply it last.

I immediately noticed a difference when I detangled my hair. I didn’t have as much dead hair as I normally do. I’m so excited to have discovered this product and also happy that they cater to natural girls like me.

After the first bottle my hair was almost back to normal. I used two more bottles which I definitely didn’t need to but did anyways lol but I’m so happy! Also recommend using with the shampoo and conditioner! And it smells great! Well worth the money to save your hair!,5,One,B00SNM5US4
"I had several friends rave about this product for color treated, over-processed hair. I have been using a coconut oil treatment and loved it, but thought I’d try this since Friends said it was good. I’d say it’s just okay as compared to my coconut oil treatment. Plus, olaplex doesn’t go far for the price you pay. The coconut oil treatment was much less expensive and much larger container, triple the amount actually",3,0,B00SNM5US4
"This a very good product, it makes you hair silky and shiny perfect for a dry curly hair",5,4,B00SNM5US4
"I've been blowing my wavy/curly hair out straight for several years, and decided to give my curls another try. At first, my curls were kind of wonky with many different curl patterns, so after a couple of months, I decided to give Olaplex a try.

There was a noticeable difference after one treatment with almost all of my hair having spiral curls. I've now washed my hair three times with it, and each time, I'm much happier with the results. However, the one time I washed without first using Olaplex, the results weren't great.

Regardless, I will continue using until I find something else that gives me similar or better results.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"My green hair had to go copper due to job reasons and my long, thick, dense, curls were frizzy and constantly tangled. I want to get it trimmed and layered but...covid. so I ordered Olaplex no 3 and no 6. I left no 3 on overnight and put no 6 on after that was washed out and my hair is already immensely better!! I still have 2/3 of a bottle only no 3 despite having tons of hair too. With that and the fact that it absolutely helps its worth every penny!",5,One,B00SNM5US4
This stuff it's God sent! My friend recommended this to me awhile ago but I never got around to getting it. My hair is dry and brittle with split ends which tangled very easily. One application of this left my hair SOOO SOFT AND MANAGEABLE! I let my hair air dry and it looks like i put something in it to make or so soft cuz my hair never looks smooth without Biosilk and Prep rally spray. I'm a believer of this stuff! It's expensive but totally worth it!,5,0,B00SNM5US4
"You know those haystacks you see in the field, all yellow & dried out? That's my hair, or it was. I bleach alot and my hair is very processed, very fried. I've used it once straight & twice in some hair bleach and it's made such a difference already. My hair feels like normal hair should, looks shinier even. Would definately recommend!

"So I’d like to start off by saying I have natural jet black hair like almost blue black that I decided to at home bleach to I’d say a level 9-10 idk what y’all consider 10 but definitely a lightest ash blond color. Long story short I bleached my hair like 10 times and at first it was stretchy and I had some breakage but after using this, the Aphogee 2 step protein treatment and the Schwarzkopf keratin potion and mask my hair is soft and manageable. The olaplex no 3 is for sure what makes the biggest difference. The longest I’ve left this on is for 3 hours but at a minimum I leave it on for one. That being said I find that my hair is softest when using this and then straightening it and using an oil, my favorite is the fanola crystals one.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"I have bleached my hair down to blonde and then put an ash blonde dye over that, so as you can imagine my hair needed tons of help. I found this bonding product while researching hair menders and mask so I had to give it a shot. My hair is dry, brittle, and splitting. After using it once my hair felt much more silky and frizz free. I can’t wait to try the shampoo and conditioner from the same line.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
This product is absolutely amazing! I have very long hair and I have been able to use this bottle for four applications. There is no odor to the product and is easily applied. Your hair must be towel dried when using. Do not use on dry hair or you will need the entire bottle and it will be less affective. It stops working after 40 minutes so the people who will leave it on overnight are not going to see any different result. I tried leaving it on for six hours to see if there was any difference and there was not. Therefore just leave it on for 10 to 40 minutes. I have bleached my hair multiple times and this has really rescued my hair.,5,0,B00SNM5US4
"My hair was so bleached it looked like cotton. Toners washed right out with the first shampoo until I found Olapex 3. It has changed the structure of my hair so it’s smooth and shinier, easier to style, too. It’s not a conditioner, it bonds your hair, closing the cuticle and allowing toners to do what they are supposed to do. No more cotton top. It’s a little pricey but it’s worth it!",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"Product came in damaged. The top was smashed in & when I took the cap off the seal was broken & the product was oosing out. I also had bought number 5 & I’m 99% sure it’s fake. I’ve used planked before & it smells nothing like it. I’m not risking my hair, many said they used these products off amazon & it severely damaged their hair. I’m returning both of these & I repurchased off of olaplex’s website, that way I know they’re safe. Olaplex states amazon is not authorized to sell their products so my mistake. Glad I didn’t use it on my hair!",1,0,B00SNM5US4
"Way to costly for little return. I have thick bleached has hair that is healthy but could always use more softness. I got nothing from using this that any product from Trader Joe's can't do. I guess I need the multi step? Not interested at the bougie price, though.",1,3,B00SNM5US4
But I’ve used it 3x now and I can notice a slight difference in my hair. I can see how people could think this was a fake product because it literally doesn’t feel like you’re putting anything into your hair and I hated that it says to saturate your hair because it felt that way. But either way like I said it does seem like repaired my hair a bit.,4,One,B00SNM5US4
"Super small product, less than size of your hand. If you have long hair then you get only 4 uses out of it maybe. Definitely not worth it for this price. Noticed a great change in hair feel and texture the first time used, by third or fourth time though not much change than using my regular shampoo and conditioner.",3,0,B00SNM5US4
"This product works great but leaves the hair feeling dry. After you use it you have to shampoo and condition. Thats when you noticed the difference. The hair is less frizzy, has more volume, and is suuuuper soft. Just make sure you shampoo and conditioner aftewards cause it does dry your hair out but it repairs it.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"I was expecting a great conditioner after reviews. It’s ok. Put on , combed through but saw a lot of my hair on comb which surprised me. Final result was a nice deep conditioner but wouldn’t say great but will try a few more times and see.",3,One,B00SNM5US4
"I have very over-processed hair and this did wonders. It is not completely healthy yet, but it’s getting there. My hair would take so long to dry since it was so damaged but I have noticed from the very first use that it’s drying much faster. I was very worried about the scent because I like my hair to smell nice but it honestly smells like generic conditioner and after shampooing and conditioning, you can’t even smell it. My only problem is how small the product is. I have very thick hair and spending over $25 for only a couple uses is not that great, however, you have to apply it on damp hair which allows you to use a lot less product and when you see how good it works, it is worth it.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"This product saved my hair. My hair stylist recommended I buy this as a once a week treatment for my hair, and it's never been healthier!
I let mine stay in longer than recommended, and sometimes even over night and wash it out in the morning. If you style or color your hair at all this product will be your new best friend!",5,2,B00SNM5US4
"FAKE!! I’m angry, I wasted my time paying the same price as I would for the original product. It’s so clearly a fake, I’ve used this product before, this FAKE it’s a very bad attempt. The packaging is cheap and nasty, and the label is bubbling and not even straight.",1,2,B00SNM5US4
"I bought this and THEN read the reviews and opinions that it is fake. So, I bought an official bottle from Sephora. They look identical in every way ... label, bottle, cap, smell, consistency and results on a swatch. I’m pretty confident this seller has the real deal. Just so you can feel confident about it.",5,One,B00SNM5US4
"Although it’s expensive for the amount you get it is totally worth it! After one use I can see the difference in my hair. I recently lightened a lot of it and 2-4 inches of my ends were just dry, fried and hay feeling. This product has made such a big difference already. It made my hair more silky and smooth. I’m going to use it once a week for now",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"Oh my! OK, so I was looking for a product to help make my hair stronger. I went from natural to relaxed. I did some research and heard about this product. Bought and bottle and was amazingly surprised of what this little powerhouse product can do. YOU must use it BEFORE you shampoo, which is a strange direction, but this is a bond builder, not a conditioner or 'treatment' as we know it. My hair is softer, stronger, shiner. I have Salt 'n Peppa hair, so keeping it soft was always a challenge. Adding Olaplex #3 to my routine was the right choice.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
I have not found a better product for my split ends! I have wavy hair that gets very damaged from highlights. For this reason I can highlight only once a year. I may be able to up that as this stuff is great. I put it on a couple times a week and leave it in overnight ... wash in the AM and believe me when I say - my split ends are almost non existent! Would definitely recommend this product.,5,0,B00SNM5US4
"use this about twice a month for my color treated hair. Doesn't smell nice but it doesn't smell horrible either. I once left it on all night and just kept my hair up in a bun the day after until i washed it out. My hair is super softer the more i use it and it tames breakage in such a major way.
though it's small, it's mighty and I've used it about 10 times now and bottle is still halfway (granted i have short shoulder length hair)",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"Just a basic conditioner. I used this product twice. I have long hair so each application is about ¼ of a bottle. I let my hair air dry both times. I saw no change in shine, feel or frizz when compared to other hair treatments. Yes, it feels soft, but no softer than if I used a drugstore hair mask on dry hair and then rinsed it out.",2,0,B00SNM5US4
"If you know then you know. This stuff is the holy grail for damaged hair. I recently put a lot of highlights in my hair, and while I love them it did damage my hair severely. I use this treatment once a week and I leave it on for a few hours. As long as your hair is wet the product will continue to repair your hair. For days after I use the treatment my hair feels so soft and smells great. If you are on the fence about this product just buy it. This size will last about a month if you use it once a week. I have very long and thick hair too and was amazed at how long the product lasted.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
This is a game changer for people who bleach their hair. Weekly olaplex masks have kept my hair so healthy through all of the processing. Pair this with once weekly deep conditioning treatments and you’ll be amazed at the strength and softness of your hair. It’s definitely my ‘can’t live without it’ beauty product.,5,0,B00SNM5US4
"This product helped my very over-processed, baby fine hair. I leave it on 45 minutes one time every week or two. It keeps my hair smooth & healthy looking. It is NOT simply a conditioner (which can weigh hair down). Though I didn't use #1 or #2 Olaplex first, i'm very pleased. This vendor sent the real product, not a knockoff.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"I’ve been using this product from my stylist and there is no scent when I buy it from a salon. I opened this a it has a fragrance. It didn’t leave my hair feeling the same either. Although the container came sealed, this is not the same Olaplex 3 I’ve gotten from hairdressers",1,2,B00SNM5US4
"After the first treatment my fine, thin, dry, color-treated, damaged hair feels soft, smoother, and maybe even a little thicker. I left it in overnight and I feel like I’m still seeing the effects develop several days later. If this is what just one treatment feels like, I can’t wait to see what the whole bottle can do for my hair!",4,0,B00SNM5US4
"I really enjoyed this product! As someone who has been color treating and bleaching my hair for almost 5+ years now, my hair has definitely been through some damage! While I try to avoid using heat as much as I can, the bleach has left my hair dry and brittle. At this point, my hair has been breaking off, creating fly-aways and overall damaged hair. I bought this product, under the recommendation of a friend, and am very very happy with it. I showered, combed my hair out, and applied this product overnight. I slept with it in, and rinsed it out in the morning (with just water, not shampoo). Now it is three days later and my hair has never been more smooth, un-tangled and shiny! I love this stuff, and will definitely be purchasing again. The only downside is the amount of product that you get for the money, however, you don't need much of this stuff for it to work!",5,2,B00SNM5US4
"I received my product this morning and used right away. I used on wet hair , let for 90 minutes , rinsed and used my shampoo and conditioner.
I have got highlights and my hair looked like an old broom lol. After one use I can see the difference , my hair is smoother and not tangled as before . I will definitely buy the #0.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"So I purchased this the other day , I just bleached my hair twice as well as I had done a color remover to get all the green dye out of my hair . It wasn’t feeling the best. I had done some hair care love 2 days in a row prior to receiving it. I used it last night and left it in for 3 hours and followed with my coco and eve mask (reminder Olaplex 3 is not a mask it will not make your hair feel soft and moisturized like a hair mask will) and honestly after 1 use my hair looks and feels so much better. I usually just use my mask but after doing some major damage to my hair the past week I decided to give this a try and I say yes ! 100% yes use this product it’s already done so much for my hair in 1 use.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"I was recommended this product by my hairdresser after I had decided to go from dark chocolate brunette to bleach blonde in a matter of 1 month. Any who knows hair knows that my ends were absolutely fried. I loved having my long hair but I wanted healthy hair as well. After the 1st use of Olaplex No 3, my hair felt like silk! It was shiny, lustrous, soft to the touch, and most importantly returning to its natural health. While being a blonde was tiring and I eventually went back to brunette, I still use Olaplex No 3 and I'll never use any other hair restoring mask again.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"I have been using olaplex for years and can not get enough! I have natural black hair and dyed it blonde/ashy for the past 6 years and damaged my hair a lot. Olaplex saved me and made it regrow quickly, allowed it to still be shiny and somewhat healthy. Love it and will buy every 3 months (that‘s how long this bottle lasts me)",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"Let me start off by saying that I never leave reviews of things I buy, but I tried this out as soon as I received it and it’s my new holy grail hair mask! I have bleached blonde hair, and my ends were starting to look extremely dry. I covered my hair in this and left in for about 40 minutes and as soon as I washed it out my hair felt so soft. Once it dried there was a noticeably big difference in my hair. I’ve tried plenty of hair masks but none have left results like these on just one use. Only downside I would say is that it’s a pretty small bottle, I have thick and long hair so for one use I’m already half way through the bottle. Other than that I would definitely recommend this to anyone needing to bring their hair back to life.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"I have a really brittle hair, it is not damaged it just dried. I used it and it gave me a super soft feeling for a few hours and then it's gone. Such a waste of money. But I got my lesson.",1,One,B00SNM5US4
"My hair is color damaged and dry, weak, and frizzy. After one application according to the directions, my hair feels smoother, looks sleeker and is shiny again. This definitely tamed my frizzies and split ends. It will take more than one treatment to restore my hair’s strength, but with a regular maintenance routine, I am confident that will happen. This product does what it is advertised to do. A small amount is all it takes to get advertised results.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
I bleached my hair and used this to help nourish it. Amazing stuff. Every time I get highlights my hair feels fried. This is the first time I bleached my own hair and it does not feel fried at all! It feels super healthy! I’m actually really shocked! This is great stuff! The bottle is small and it’s pricey but worth it to replenish your hair!,5,0,B00SNM5US4
"Waste of time & money. I saw absolutely no difference in my hair, even after 3 uses. When my hairstylist uses her olaplex on my hair it does wonders. She leaves it on for 10-15 minutes and in that one time my hair feels and looks so amazingly healthy. This leads me to suspect maybe what I ordered from amazon is not really 100% olaplex...very disappointed. I would NOT buy this again...better off going to a salon or ordering directly from an authorized olaplex distributor.",1,2,B00SNM5US4
"I’m mixed race (half black and half white), and this conditioner was just okay for my hair. My hair is very thick and I needed to use a lot of the conditioner in order to get a level of conditioning that felt decent.

"My son is dating a hairdresser and she recommended this product to me. My previous hairdresser used a very harsh chemical on my hair giving it a very dry, damaged look. This product saved my hair!!

FYI: I am over 50, have some grey, have normal to thin hair but a lot of it and am blonde. I swim and am in the sun, so this helps my hair!!",5,0,B00SNM5US4

Applied generously olaplex, massaged it in. Waited 25 minutes with a plastic cap on so it stays damp.. then shampoo & conditioned hair. NO visible result. My hair has been bleached damage at the ends and i did not see any improvements. sorry.. I sent this back $30 not woth it",1,0,B00SNM5US4
I had brown hair and about 6 months ago made the decisions to go platinum blond it was fun for a while but many the bleach destroyed my hair. Ive used this for 2 days and I've already noticed a huge difference its made the frizz almost completely go away and its stopped a lot of breakage as well. A little expensive but you definitely get what you pay for. Will continue to use for sure!,5,One,B00SNM5US4
"i ordered this and then started digging into reviews. a lot of people reviewed stating that its fake? im no pro but i dont think thats the case. it comes directly from olaplex and has a factory seal. it made my hair feel amazing, similar to when i have olaplex done at the salon",5,One,B00SNM5US4
I have purchased this product two times and it has done nothing for my hair! I do not understand how it gets all these great reviews !

"Overall great product! With extremely bleached hair (went from 2 to 10) that’s now sporting a light silver, you can imagine the damage. I find I get the best results when I use this on wet hair, then shampoo and condition with clarifying products. The next wash I use clarifying shampoo and a keratin + moisturizing mask... MAGIC! All my crazy split ends and flyaways disappear. I do this once every two weeks and my hair has been healthier than ever",5,One,B00SNM5US4

"Okay ladies, yes buy this. Wow, literally the best hair product I've ever purchased. I've got thinning, lightened, damaged hair cause I've got an unhealthy obsession with dyeing my hair at the salon (someone stop me, but I caaaannnttt). This took my dry, rough bleached hair and made it soft and shiny again. I usually dampen my hair with a spritz water bottle then apply for 10-15 minutes before getting into the shower about twice a week (which is how often I wash my hair anyway). You are supposed to wash it out using your usual shampoo and conditioner (I use a different brand) and the results are so amazing. I highly recommend.",5,0,B00SNM5US4

Not as great as I had hoped & heard it was. :(",3,0,B00SNM5US4
"It's exspensive for the size of the bottle but being my hair is so damaged and fried I wanted to get something that would work and be worth the money. I throw some in after the shower and leave it in for the day. I don't like to have products in my hair before bed bc then it gets on my pillow. Really youre supposed to rinse it 10 minutes after you put it through damp hair but it's really just an inconvence for me so I leave my hair a little greasy for one day and throw it up. Doesn't hurt, and does the trick!",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"Soo upon reading the reviews on this olaplex, I was a little torn whether not if it was real or a fake, tbh. But I took the risk n ordered it, and since I received it the other day I finally
Decided to do a treatment today on my hair. I can genuinely tell u that this is the real thing. I had a little left over from a previous olaplex that I ordered from Sephora and I tested the bottle, smell and of course texture of the product. But most importantly, if it worked on my hair just as my other bottle. And it did!! I got the same or better results. So if you were feeling like I was on whether or not it’s real, don’t worry it is! And if u have prime u can save a little for shipping! Hope this helps someone.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"This is legitimate and after buying a few bottles straight from the Olaplex website I had a good idea of what to look for. The consistancy, color and scent were all the same as any other bottle I've bought.

This product is just basic. You are better off going to a drug store or Walmart and purchasing a cheap leave in conditioner. At least then your hair would be conditioned and smell better. This didn't repair anything. Kenue is a better brand if you want to go the fancy salon route of products.,1,One,B00SNM5US4
"Miraculous! This product reversed all the damage my hair had suffered over the years after only 3 uses! My hair was very frizzy, dull and brittle. I had it dyed three times over the past six months and it was very unhealthy and damaged. This product eliminated the frizz, made my hair so soft and shiny and I noticed much less split ends than before. I use it once a week and leave it on for about 6 hours and then wash my hair as usual.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"This was not what I was expecting as I thought I was purchasing a shampoo not a treatment. My best response to this was applying it 20 min to washing my hair. This I think was the ideal time as my hair was soft and shiny when it dried.
I left it in my hair another time for 8 hours and actually think it dried out my hair.

My hair is fine but I have a lot. Its very strong and normally adapts to anything that i apply. Not this product.

Very overpriced and there are alot more products out there that work much better for me!!",3,One,B00SNM5US4
"this stuff has been a godsend lol. my hair is bleach blonde and has been through the wringer and needed some help, but I haven’t found an oil or conditioning mask that did anything. I’ve used this twice and my hair feels SO healthy and I even got a comment about how it looks like I just walked out of the salon. the only con is that there’s not a lot of product, and for someone with thick hair it’s kinda a bummer to me that it’s a little pricy but i’ll probably only get a few uses out of it. I used it once and went through about 1/3 of the little bottle. i’d say it’s worth it though and i’ll be buying more :) thank youuuu",4,0,B00SNM5US4
"Just to clarify this product is meant as a weekly maintenance treatment to prolong the benefits of a full olaplex application. Olaplex is a 2 step treatment (hence this product is named no.3). Many reviewers seem disenchanted because they expect amazing results using no.3 only. This is NOT a moisturizing or conditioning treatment either (another misconception amongst reviewers). When used as a full line olaplex is a lifesaver for those who chemically treat their hair. Ideally use it before damage is caused. Adding it into bleach or color prevents breakage. If you're already have existing breakage this will help dramatically. Very brittle hair may take a few FULL applications, but worth the investment as this stuff does what no other hair treatment can do.",5,7,B00SNM5US4

I just reordered the 3. The shampoo lasts the longest but the treatment bottle is small so goes fast on long hair. Still worth the $$.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
You do have to wet your hair then dry it with a towel and put this product in your hair for a minimum of 10 minutes then wash it out and then shampoo or whatever is your regular routine after but it smells really good and already has my hair a little shiner and soft after one use.

I put it on my damp hair and let it sit for an hour. I noticed some change, but I used it a second time a few days later, and my hair finally was back to normal. It's a bond builder, not a moisturizer. So it really help rebuild your hair. Doesn't fix it completely, but definitely helps undo some of the damage",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"My stylist recommended this for my color treated hair. Due to the pandemic I was unable to get more from her. I was very happy to find it available from this seller at an equal price. I use both a blow dryer and flat iron for styling. This really cuts down on drying time, leaving my hair soft and shiny.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"Used this product for a few weeks. It does nothing for repairing hair. Gave 1 star as the scent is nice. Its very thin, turns sticky then drys hard. This did absolutely nothing for my hair. I've since had better results from regular priced products from the store.",1,One,B00SNM5US4
"This stuff works really well. It is a bit pricey, but totally worth it. You could use it without the Olaplex shampoo and conditioner if on a tight budget.",5,One,B00SNM5US4
"Left my hair brittle and breaking after one use.

My hair felt healthy and strong despite the recent bleach and tone. The products I was using have been keeping it healthy. Then... olaplex. This stuff RUINED my hair, making it fragile, brittle, dry. Anything with ""Bondfix"" seems to hurt my hair more than anything else. Don't waste your money on this kind if stuff. I have gad success with OGX Keratin Oil Conditioner, Biotin & Collogen Conditioner, Miracle penetrating Oil and PURA D'OR Hair Thinning Therapy.",1,0,B00SNM5US4
"I used Olaplex at my stylist's recommendation. I have very brittle hair and extremely split ends. Using Olaplex once a week has made my hair significantly softer. But, it hasn't ""sealed"" my split ends as I hoped. My stylist recommended a different application routine than what's on the back of the bottle (I shampoo first, then put in Olaplex with a touch of my favorite conditioner for 10 minutes, then THOROUGHLY rinse). I do recommend this product as a deep conditioning treatment!",4,One,B00SNM5US4
Didn’t notice a difference in my head at all. I’ve used it for both short periods of time (30 min) to long periods of time (over night-10+hrs) And didn’t notice anything different. It felt as though I needed to put on my conditioner on even after putting this on.,1,One,B00SNM5US4
"It's expensive. I didn't see much difference with my hair getting stronger. Two bad side-effects I experienced with this product: build-up on my scalp and build-up on the hair strand itself. So, while I am brushing my hair there's A LOT of white flakes in the air and on the hairbrush.",2,0,B00SNM5US4
Based on other reviews and YouTube reviews this product was just okay to me. I was hoping it would really bond my hair as I left it on damp hair for about 30 minutes before showering. When I watched reviews - other peoples hair looks amazing as their hair was damaged from bleaching and coloring too. I will give it a try again. I've tried this 2 times in hopes that i needed an extra treatment but I'm going in for #3. Can't wait to see the results after 3 times.,4,0,B00SNM5US4
"I was a little concerned this might be a knock off, but it's the same that is sold in my salon. Works as described. I've damaged my hair a LOT with bleach and color, and this makes it feel softer. I'm still working on getting the ""frizzy look"" under control all the time, but this helps tremendously",4,One,B00SNM5US4
"Most amazing product. I've used this for many applications including perms, bleaching, color correction and extremely damaged hair. No product works better. If used as instructed at three times per week and you have long or thick hair think about buying two or the entire treatment kit. This is a very small bottle, although it does cover a lot.

If you don't get results from this product there' no product that can.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"This is a very good product, however i could only stretch it to five applications or about a month and a half. I have fine thin hair so if I had thicker hair it would be even fewer treatments. The price seems too high for just a few applications. I recommend an improvement in that area. Also, check out the level of product in the brand new bottle with a seal - it’s a rip off this time, almost 25% is missing :(",4,0,B00SNM5US4
If you’re hair has been damaged or is breaking off by a bad color job. Use this. My hair was literally fried by a hairdresser that put bleach directly on my hair. I had no idea you weren’t supposed to do this. She left it on too long and my hair was like cotton candy. THIS completely transformed my hair,5,One,B00SNM5US4
I bleached my hair from my natural dark brunette to BLONDE which was cool but fried my hair and completely made it feel like dead damaged straw UNTIL I used this product - I have been using it once a month consistently and my hair is amazingly revived (not totally back to my natural strength/smoothness - but amazingly improved nonetheless.),5,One,B00SNM5US4
"This is exactly the same as my Olaplex 3 from my salon. It works very well, especially if left on overnight. I use in combination with the shampoo and condition (4&5) and have noticed a lot less breakage and damage. My hair is extremely long and bleached regularly, but I have very little noticeable damage thanks to this product.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"My hair has been damaged from about 13 years of permanent dye, bleaching and chemical treatments. In just one use (I put this into wet hair, wrapped my hair in a sleeping headwrap and kept it in overnight) my hair, which felt like straw yesterday, feels like silk today. Time will tell whether the results last (I will be continuing this twice a week) but I have to say, I've tried countless hair products trying to make a difference to my damaged hair and this is by far the best.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"I don’t normally do reviews but I felt I needed to on this. This stuff is a miracle. I had accidentally fried my hair to the point that I had huge clumps falling out, it was bad. I needed a way to fix my hair as best as possible so I can put color in it without losing all my hair. I have used this product twice in tandem with the Olaplex Bonding Hair Oil. My hair went from completely fried and unable to be brushed to almost completely normal! I’m so impressed by this product. It was absolutely worth the money.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
This stuff is amazing! I’ve been bleaching my hair for a few years and even with the best conditioners my hair would be dry and brittle and the natural curl I had would be gone. I bleached my hair 3days ago and after just one Olaplex 3 treatment my hair is healthier than it has ever been. It feels thicker and softer and has incredible body.,5,0,B00SNM5US4
"This stuff is the BOMB. My hair loves protein but is fine so I can also overdo the protein easily. This acts like a protein treatment and gives shape back to my curls! I have low porosity, 3a/b curls that easily get weighed down with too much moisture and this stuff is AMAZING. I try to do it once a week but even every other week makes a difference. One bottle lasts me a couple of months.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
100% fake. I was wondering why it wasn’t doing much for me so you’re better off ordering it on Sephora (: the size is off the label is also a bit off & the big difference is the month the fake says 24 & real is 12 months. SAVE UR MONEY,1,2,B00SNM5US4
"Tried this today, I left it on for about an hour before I washed it out. I definitely can see an improvement in my split ends and my hair feels super soft. Excited to try this on a weekly basis to see the longer term benefits",5,One,B00SNM5US4
Excellent product!!! I have tried many products and this is my favorite so far. My hair was looking very dry after I dyed it. After using this product it has changed so much now it looks very shine and people can notice. Even the first time I used it I could tell it looked more shiny. Now that I have used it around 5 times it looks even better!! 100% recommended and worth it.,5,One,B00SNM5US4
I think this did it’s job. I had brought another product similar I think worked better. My hair was a little frizzy after.,5,One,B00SNM5US4
I had to bleach my hair to remove stubborn dark hair dye. Color remover would not work. After bleaching twice my hair was really damaged. My ends especially. They were very dry and coarse. I ordered this and no.0. 1 time use of both and a deep conditioner brought my hair back to life. My ends are still a little dry but i feel if I continue to use this it will revive them. I am so so so happy!!!!!!,5,0,B00SNM5US4
This product is a HAIR SAVER! I bleach my hair and I use this every time I wash my hair (2 times a week usually). I have fine naturally blonde hair and when I lighten it my hair will fry without this stuff. Since I’ve been using it (few months now) I have noticed my hair is super strong and healthy. I’m a loyal customer now!,5,0,B00SNM5US4
"After dying and bleaching my hair so many times while in lockdown, it was SUPER damaged. I was getting scared I was gonna have to chop it. After the first treatment with the Olaplex 3 my hair was manageable again. Very happy with the product!!

I know each hair type responds differently to treatments, my hair is really fine and this worked great for me. I don’t know how it is for other hair types.",5,One,B00SNM5US4
"I read reviews on other sites that you should be careful about buying Olaplex from Amazon because they are not a certified dealer. Unfortunately, I ignored the caution and bought this product. I put it on my hair and it doesn't work. It's past the 30 day return date, so I can't return it. DON""T BUY THIS. Instead, purchase this at Sephora or another certified dealer.",1,3,B00SNM5US4
"It’s a small bottle and I never used a lot in my hair because I was trying to preserve it and make it last, so I didn’t see much of a difference in my hair. I can imagine if you used more product along with the Olaplex shampoo and conditioner it would really fix your hair! Unfortunately too pricey to repurchase or buy the whole line.",3,0,B00SNM5US4
"I have been using it for a short time, but it really works, I recommend it even before painting your hair as a protector. very happy with my purchase 😊I'm going to buy the shampoo and the conditioner, although the price is a bit high and the packaging is worth it. 😉",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"I’m not sure why there are so many bad reviews foe this product. It is a miracle worker. My hair has never been softer and it was extremely damaged from bleaching. You need to follow the instructions very carefully and you’ll get the results you want, trust me. This stuff was so worth it.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"Not sure I like this, hair definitely does not feel moisturized after usage. Maybe it's building your hair bonds and you need to use other products for moisture.",3,One,B00SNM5US4
"I believe this is a decent product. It helps with breakage but I don't see the wow effect. Perhaps it depends on the hair porosity and texture. For reference I am relaxed 4C hair. I use it like 1x every two weeks or 1x weekly. It does make my hair soft and manageable. All in all, although the bottle is very small, I would still repurchase.",4,0,B00SNM5US4
"I used to work in beauty saloon and all our hairdressers were using Olaplex products to protect client's hair from damaging while coloring.
I use it now for myself. Nornaly my hair is very dry at the ends and dull. After using this product it looks and feels much more lively.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
This product is amazing. I’ve been meaning to buy it for a while but the price always threw me off. It’s not a conditioner but rather a protein and hair bonding treatment. I put this stuff on when I’m coloring my roots. I soak the ends and slap this stuff on generously on the ends of my hair and it instantly erased my split ends and makes the hair stronger. If used wrong it can fry the hair.,5,0,B00SNM5US4
I didn't believe all the hype. Then I tried it. No. 3 managed to soften my dry frizzled hair to the silky long strands I had as a near-youngster. Amazing. I just ordered another one. I am not one to over sell anything. I am a cynic at heart. But this product really works.,5,0,B00SNM5US4
"I was hesitant to order this product on Amazon, but decided to give it a shot. It came packaged with a foil seal. Used it twice now and so far so good. I had very dry damaged hair from bleaching, I used this twice a week for an hour and it works. Keeps my ends moisturized even after the wash.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"I know I've spent hundreds of dollars on hair products that others have said were ""magic"" or ""life-changing"" only to be disappointed over and over again, but this stuff is the real deal! My hair is naturally curly, and therefore naturally coarse and dry, and I saw a huge difference after just one use. I also have a few spots that were damaged by some bad highlights and it even worked on them. It made my hair much softer and shinier and gave my curls real definition. LOVE! Just note that the bottle is little (much smaller than I expected!). My hair is medium-long (just past my shoulders) and thick and I used more than half the bottle in one use. It was worth it, though, and I'm ordering more now!!!",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"I wish I would have taken a picture! I didn’t actually use this because I looked through the questions and someone asked why the bottle said 12m on the back instead of 24m. The pictures on the website and even in the listing says 24m, so I went ahead and returned it and ordered from Sephora which indeed says 24m. I don’t know, I just didn’t want to take a chance on something I’m putting in my hair. lol",2,2,B00SNM5US4
"It did not repair my damage hair. I used a whole bottle and my hair looks exactly the same as when I first applied the Olaplex No. 3 Hair Perfector. The product is too expensive. Not worth the money.
I am having better results now with the Hask Orchid & White Truffle Moisture Rich Deep Conditioner that I bought for only $2...",1,0,B00SNM5US4
"I tend to just use this bottle and not the whole OLAPEX series -- but it has really helped out my hair. I love how soft and easy to manage it makes my hair. If you're struggling with your hair, definitely try splurging out for this. You don't even need to use it so long.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"Well after all the reviews this product my daughter bought from Amazon, I was waiting for mine to come in from Sephora.
This Amazon product really worked well first try, I felt a big difference in the texture of my hair, it is very damaged from beaching and color correction. Real not Real not sure but I will definitely compare both products.",5,0,B00SNM5US4

"I hope is the original, I has a lighter scent to it and it’s not as thick as the one I bought from my hairdresser, I haven’t seen any changes and with the other one I seen an immediate change.

Ultimately, if are buying this product to help heal your hair after damage buy the authentic thing!",2,One,B00SNM5US4
"Holy cow. Used this for a half hour, followed with a deep conditioner for an hour, on wavy, fine, high porosity hair. I’ve been dying my hair for years and the damage was visible in that it was frizzy and dull despite months of the curly girl method. This boost, this one thing I added to my routine, was almost emotional. The wave is now a LOT more defined. It’s been hours and it’s still maintained it’s moisture and wave. It’s so much shinier it’s ridiculous. This is it. Game changer.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"After years of color my hair box black this stuff saved my hair after each coloring getting back to blonde.

Seriously a lifesaver!",5,0,B00SNM5US4

"I have platinum bleach highlights in my hair, which has also been lightened from brown to blonde. Needless to say it causes a lot of damage to my hair. I tried this after reading the reviews and it works beautifully! I left it on my hair for about 30 minutes before shampooing and conditioning. I may try to put some heat on it next time to open up the hair follicles, but it seems great. Very little hair in my brush after it dried.",5,0,B00SNM5US4

I've heard the many praises of Olaplex from coworkers for many years but I thought it was tested on animals. Only recent have I found out it isn't. I'm so glad I did because my hair is so much better. I hope it keeps improving after so my damage it endured.,5,0,B00SNM5US4

"Pretty expensive for the small amount received. Not overall thrilled with the way my hair was after the first treatment.

There are better hair treatments out there for less.",3,0,B00SNM5US4

It needs to left on for several minutes and then washed out. You then condition with another conditioner. I love this product.,5,0,B00SNM5US4
Over all great product for damaged or overly dry hair. Makes hair look very shiney. Only need a small amount on damp towel dried hair and I mix it with a little bit of Loreal Elive color vibrancy rapid reviver deep conditioner,5,One,B00SNM5US4

Used the whole bottle ... didn’t do anything. Sometimes even left it on for as long. As 24 hours. Disappointed. I have bleach blonde hair so I was excited to see at least some repair.... maybe I got a defective bottle?,1,2,B00SNM5US4
I couldn’t tell until after my hair had fully dried but it improved the look and feel of my hair after one use. I’m going to add it to a weekly routine to repair the damage in my platinum ombré.

Before this I tried using silk pillow cases, DIY home remedies, Salon conditioner treatments, etc. This product is so worth it!",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"This little bottle is expensive per oz and I saw no Noticeable difference in my hair. I have naturally wavy/curl 2B, high porosity hair and I use a blow dryer to straighten it everyday. I followed the directions and applied to towel dried hair and I let it sit for 10 mins before washing and conditioning. I expected my hair to look healthier and feel smoother after using. But my hair feels and looks no different then before I used it.",2,0,B00SNM5US4
"I have been hearing about this product for months and I just used it for the first time. It is amazing! I haven't dried my hair yet but it is so soft and smooth and feels so much more healthy. I can only imagine how it will feel after continued use! I have done a lot of research on it and it seemed that the longer you leave it on, the better it is. I left this on for 4 hours while I did things around the house. I am not sure if that helped the results or not but I am so excited with the results and I'm so happy to find something to help me keep my hair healthy. I naturally have dark blonde hair and get white blonde highlights about every 8 weeks so it needs all of the help it can get!",5,0,B00SNM5US4
I have bleached blonde hair and it made my hair feel way better if I was gonna have to cut it but this made it feel healthy without having to take any other length off,5,One,B00SNM5US4
"This has worked wonders in restoring my hair. I severely damaged my hair with multiple at home bleaching sessions, going from dark brown to platinum blonde. The last bleaching session I did caused ton of breakage. After research, I discovered Olaplex3. It really does work to restore your hair. One thing I will add is that it's definitely NOT a leave in conditioner. You absolutely MUST rinse thoroughly out of your hair or it leaves your hair unmanageable to comb through when drying (in my personal experience and opinion)",4,0,B00SNM5US4
"Okay. Like the headline says, I was sceptical asf that this would even work. I dyed a few blonde streaks in my hair and it left it really damaged. After one use (about 30 minutes of processing) it’s ALREADY that much closer to feeling and being healthy.. like a shocking amount actually. I truly wish I had bought this product when I was regularly bleaching my hair. The people that are saying this product is fake or doesn’t work have no idea what they’re talking about. If you’re having doubts, don’t! This product DOES WORK!!!!",5,One,B00SNM5US4
Not sure what all the hype is about on this but I found a product from Sally’s beauty supply that worked better and was $10... Too expensive for what you are getting ...unless this was not actually genuine product .,3,One,B00SNM5US4
"This is a high quality product, but you must use it consistently to see results from it. I used it for 5 weeks with this exact size bottle (I have very thin medium length hair). I didn't buy another bottle after this one ran out and saw that my hair was suffering a little from it. I have since restarted using it and it has made a world of difference in my hair. 9/10 would recommend.",5,0,B00SNM5US4

"After one use (left on for 45 minutes), some of my natural curls returned. I'd given those curls up for dead after several rounds of bleaching left my hair brittle. Strength and softness seems to be returning to hair too. But the fact that it brought back my natural curl leads me to believe that this product indeed rebuilds bonds.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"Love using olaplex, it has really helped my damaged hair get back on track. I've bought this product direct from Olaplex and also from Amazon. I notice that the amazon version is much thinner than the one purchase direct. They both seem to work but it makes me wonder if the formulation is different or diluted on Amazon.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
I think this has fixed the keratin damaged hair I have been dealing with for almost 3 long years. I will be so happy if this continues and doesn't eventually lead to more hair loss like everything I've tried so far. Olaplex no.3 has given me hope.,,0,B00SNM5US4
Purchased this product to help my dry damaged hair. The price looked the same as the OLAPLEX website so I was hoping it just save on the shipping. After it arrived I used as directed by Olaplex and the result was a burned scalp. I’m already losing my hair and this made the problem worse with now fist fulls of my hair falling out after use.,1,One,B00SNM5US4
I recently went from brown to Blondeeee and my ends were very dry. I put some on wet hair at night and watch my shows. Rinse off then shampoo/condition as normal. It really makes a difference!!!! If I wasnt so cheap I would buy the shampoo too lol.,5,0,B00SNM5US4
"I really wanted this to be a product that lived up to its hype. I am sure it works for some people, but I was pretty disappointed. It did nothing for me. I could not recommend it for someone with dry, salt and pepper hair. Did not do any harm, but it didn't any good either.",2,0,B00SNM5US4
"I cannot stress enough how amazing this product was. After lightening my hair with bleach and dying it to a golden brown, my very curly hair was left very dry. It was very rough textured and lifeless. After using this product my hair feels amazing. It's moisturized. It's healthier. It shines. I am absolutely blown away by the effect of this product.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"Bottle is small but a little goes a long way. I absolutely destroyed my hair bleaching it, after cutting off the dead I used this on the remainder of my hair and it really has made my hair feel soft and silky again. I did have to buy two bottles and it did take over a month to get the desired texture I was looking for, but it was worth it.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"This product truly will protect and save your hair, especially when bleaching. This is a must have if you lighten your hair. Also recommend Olaplex 1 and 2 (make sure your salon/stylist use this) and buy the new 4 and 5 shampoo and conditioner. I now have level 10 hair with gray coloring ombre (ps and i have long hair that did not break) ! Olaplex made it possible and kept my hair safe.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"My hair is very damaged from bleach so I thought I'd give it a go. I understood that the product was only 3.5oz, but the directions say to apply generously from roots to ends - I have above shoulder length hair and I had to use about 1/4 of the bottle to saturate it. The kicker is that for damaged hair it says to apply 2-3 times a week, and once a week for normal hair. I might be able to get 2 weeks out of this bottle, a month if I only apply to my ends. My hair did feel better after one use, but unfortunately for me 3.5oz at $28.00 for two weeks is not practical, and I wont be purchasing again. Nice product though.",4,0,B00SNM5US4
"I love this product! My hair looks great and a lot of people compliment my hair as well. I have bleached my hair twice in the past four months. This tiny bottle is just a life saver.

I noticed a huge difference once I left it on my hair for four hours before rinsing. As well as putting one of those disposable plastic hair covers you can buy at Sally’s beauty. I leave it on while I do things around the house or read.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"I have damaged broken hair due to, way to many bleach sessions! I coated my hair and left it on for 2.5 hours, it did help hydrate my hair just not as much as I was hoping it would! I'm going to leave it on longer the next time and hope it works even better. It did more good than bad, so it's worth a try!!",4,0,B00SNM5US4
"I have grey hair - my own and the last thing I want is frizzy Houston hair. I look witchy with frizz and though that's a plus at Halloween, it's not my favorite day or night look. I was surprised by this and the leave in conditioner. My hair is smoother for about 4 days just in time for a wash or a ruining walk outside.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"It seems authentic. I have nothing to compare it to. I have only used it once, but I did notice an improvement in my hair texture. I used this as a prewash conditioner. Helped with tangles. Not happy that the price is doubled than what can be purchased at a beauty supply store. That's why I deducted 1 star.",4,One,B00SNM5US4
"Oh my god!!!! This product is a miracle!!! I have hair down past my waist and I needed something to repair the ends of my hair because it was starting to feel ""straw"" like. One use of this product and my hair is soooo shiny and soft again! I live in the city and the harsh water also was causing my hair to get a texture on it, and it's gone now! Literal life saver!",5,One,B00SNM5US4
"This product is amazing!!!! AMAZING!!!! Have only used it once & cannot believe how soft my hair is!!!! I bleach my short hair every 4-5 weeks, so it’s always dry & brittle. Now it’s soft & shiny!!! After 1 application!!!! Unbelievable!!!! LOVE!!!!!!",5,One,B00SNM5US4
"No creo q sea original! El producto no sirve, no recomiendo a nadie q lo compre, a mi me puso el cabello súper esponjado y no entiendo por qué?... ahora las puntas de mi cabello están peor que antes y eso fue con una sola aplicación. Si pudiera dar cero estrellas las daría 😖",1,0,B00SNM5US4
I saw this listed in an article of the 23 best health things to buy on Amazon. Figured I would give it is try. The instructions say use 2 - 3 X a week and leave on for 10 minutes or longer. I am almost done with the bottle and every time I use it I have left it on overnight. This is no where near as good as other similar products. Very watery also.,3,0,B00SNM5US4
"Have used this before and love it. Says to used no more than once a week. Formula 3 is not the salon strength it is specifically for at home use. Worked great. Brought my hair back from weak, stretchy over processed easy to tangle in just one use!",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"I bought this “olaplex 3” in 2017 and I was disappointed. I just bought a bottle from my stylist and it was amazing. It’s very clear to me that I received a fake product, $30 thrown away. I wish they had better quality control.",1,2,B00SNM5US4
I read about this prior to buying but still didn't know if it would help my Native American hair. It's a different texture. Followed the directions.. the scent is lovely! I can't believe the difference it made in just one treatment! I'm going to sleep with it on next time. I've read other's do so. The bottle is small but good things come in small packages. I would recommend this to anyone that needs their hair to look and feel healthier. ❤️,5,0,B00SNM5US4
Label not put on straight and small air bubbles on top of label leaves me feeling like someone printed and put a sticker on this bottle. Not sure if this is the real product or not.,1,One,B00SNM5US4
"As far as I can tell, this may not be the authentic Olaplex 3. My hair was in good condition but after using one bottle and starting on a second my hair is dry, broken and frizzy. Do NOT waste your money. Buy this from a salon!!",2,0,B00SNM5US4
"Theres a lot of hype about this product. I do like it and it makes my hair feel great THAT DAY. But I'm still trying to see the long term effects. Cause I feel like after a day or 2 my hair starts feeling dry again, and I have been using it for a few months now",4,0,B00SNM5US4
"I read all the raves and thought, why not? Left it on my towel dried hair for 25 minutes this morning, washed and conditioned and air dried and my hair has more static, frizz and fly always than it did before. WTH? How is it possible that everyone is raving how wonderful this is and my hair feels awful? My hair is dyed, not bleached and hasn't been heat treated in over 6 months. Until I used this Olaplex 3, air drying left it wavy and shiny. What a waste of money.",1,0,B00SNM5US4
"If this is fake, it’s a dang good one. After doing a bleach bath and two rounds of hair dye, my hair feels better than it did when I started after one use. My hair is soft, smooth and just looks overall amazing. Absolutely worth it!!",5,0,B00SNM5US4
Postpartum hair loss and color damage really made me think I was going bald. This saved my hair. Might’ve been the hormones but I cried the first time I used this it was that good.,5,One,B00SNM5US4
I am almost done with this bottle and I see no difference in my straw hair. I am trying to save what hair I have left due to bleach. Thought this would help due to reviews I have seen but very disappointed. Just wondering how many bottles I need before I see a difference cause these bottles are not cheap.,1,2,B00SNM5US4
This is the real thing. Olaplex is now allowing the product to be sold at Sephora so why wouldn’t they distribute from Amazon? It made a very good difference from the first use to my bleached damaged hair.,5,4,B00SNM5US4
"Love, love, love this. My hair was mushy from over bleaching, plus my hair is getting thinner and fine. Olaplex has made a tremendous difference. It is not mushy, seems thicker with no fly always. Plus it lasts a long time without having to wash my hair so often. You won't regret using this. Great shine also. Wish I would have used it long ago.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
I heard great things about this and finally got around to using this. Only used it once. Not only did I find out I’m allergic to god knows what (as my whole body broke out) but it caused hair to fall out. My entire skin reacted.,3,0,B00SNM5US4
"The first time I tried the shampoo, conditioner and leave in treatment it dried my hair out. I thought maybe I didn't leave it on long enough. The second time, my hair started falling out as I was combing it, like...a lot of it. I immediately threw it in the trash. I only purchased it because so many are raving about it. Never again.",1,2,B00SNM5US4
I don’t know where this has been all my life! It’s hands down the best product I’ve ever used for my hair. I leave it in for a few hours at a time and my hair is so soft and smooth when I wash it out. It’s not a conditioner but a bond builder so it’s actually helping strengthen your hair. I love it and recommend it to everyone!,5,0,B00SNM5US4
"I'm very pleased with this product. My hair was feeling dry and straw like and this really brought it back to life even after one use. It is a small bottle for the price, but I've used it twice on my should length hair and still have a little over half the bottle left.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
IT did nothing for me ! i dont know if its this specific seller or if its the product because from the reviews i've read and heard about this product i am beyond disappointed !!,1,One,B00SNM5US4
As a blonde I am no stranger to damaged hair. About 2 yes ago my hair got to the point where it was over processed and started to break. I was SO self conscious about this because I always thought of my hair as my best feature. THIS PRODUCT HAS MADE A HUGE DIFFERENCE!!! By no means did this work over night but slowly my hair has started to grow longer and thicker again. I’ve been using 2-3 times a week and once I meet my goal length will cut down to 1x. I have also been using collagen too which makes a big difference!,5,0,B00SNM5US4
"I've only used this once and I feel a huge difference. My hair was breaking a lot from repeated bleaching. I freaked out and researched products, and their patent impressed me, so I decided to pay $28 for a tiny bottle of stuff. I'm not usually the kind of person to splurge on stuff like that. So far it seems like the $28 dollars was definitely a worthy investment. After one use my hair doesn't feel like straw, it feels like it's returning to normal, while weeks of conditioning did nothing.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
I'm pretty sure this is not the real product. I've used Olaplex from Sephora before and it performed completely differently (the real product is amazing). This one also smells differently. Beware!,1,One,B00SNM5US4
Only used it a couple of time but I did not notice any improvements to my hair.,3,One,B00SNM5US4
This is the best conditioner I have found to date. I use it once a week and leave on for about an hour. It leaves my hair feeling stronger and healthy and shiny. You don’t need to use a lot and it is worth the price. Great product. A real keeper!,5,One,B00SNM5US4
"Several other Olaplex on Amazon are fake or diluted, so be aware. I LOVE Olaplex and was able to know this was the real thing. It works right away, and does wonders for my hair. Unfortunately it is expensive and only lasts a few times (maybe 4-6). I have medium length hair and use this often to make it soft and not frizzy.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"I first saw this product on the Today Show and took them up on the recommendation. I got a bottle and put a small amount in damp hair about 20 mins. before washing out in the shower. My hair styles nicely and has never looked better! I have spent many years trying to control unruly, curly hair that never looks the same twice. Love blowing my hair dry straight! It is worth every penny! It is a small bottle however, you use so little it will last quite awhile!",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"My hair is curly/wavy but after YEARS of flat ironing, it’s become dry, brittle and lost a lot of its curl. After just two uses of this (in conjunction with the Olaplex shampoo and conditioner) I’ve noticed a difference. My hair is more moisturized and the curl has started to come back. I wish you got more product for the price but I recommend and will be purchasing again once I run out.",5,0,B00SNM5US4

I was able to 4 treatments out of this little bottle. It has made such an improvement to my fine wavy hair. Hair damage consists of coloring a couple times a year & very hard water. I am buying another bottle for me and 1 more for my daughter!,5,One,B00SNM5US4

"I discovered Olaplex at a previous hairdresser and began purchasing it online after moving. I have thick, medium coarse hair and I use this once or twice a week to keep my hair in good shape. I find if I add Olaplex to towel dried hair and leave it in all night, it does a really excellent job.",5,0,B00SNM5US4

"My hair stylist used this product on me when I went in for my cut and color and I absolutely loved the way it made my hair feel. I have very thin, limp and lifeless hair and the Olaplex seems to give it more fullness and shine. I use it once a week and I love the results!",4,9,B00SNM5US4
"This product is amazing. I have very over processed dried-out bleached hair. I am trying to go back to my natural medium brown color and restore health to my hair. I used this product for the first time and wow, am I impressed! After one use my hair is already fuller, less frizzy, and much more hydrated! After over processing, my hair lost a lot of its natural curl and after one use of Olaplex No. 3 I have my natural texture back! I have very long thick hair so I left the product in closer to 45 mins for my first use and it did not weigh down or over condition. Feels great after shampoo and conditioner! Will purchase again!",5,0,B00SNM5US4
This stuff is amazing!! Not to sound dramatic but maybe even life changing 😆. I’ve been using it for quite some time now. My hair feels like silk after I use this. It’s so moisturizing and restorative and it actually smells good. Perfect for bleached hair!!,5,One,B00SNM5US4
I did not pay attention while ordering this because it was the same price at the salon but wow no!! It is so tiny and not worth the money they are asking! This product itself is great dont get me wrong but this seller is NOT giving you the best bang for your buck!,1,One,B00SNM5US4
This bottle last me 4 treatment because I have long thick hair. I recently got my hair retouched and my hair was so fried. It was breaking off so this was the best option for me. I see little difference but its results! Didn't stop my hair from breaking but made my hair more tangible. Just bought a second bottle. Hoping to continue using this !,5,0,B00SNM5US4

"I have only used this product once and I can already see a huge difference in my hair. I had very dry, damaged hair after bleaching and not properly putting moisture in and after one use my hair feels less like hay. Obviously this is not a miracle, I do still need to keep up with maintenance and moisture masks, but it truly does make a difference even on the first use. I would say it is worth the price if you were in the same position as me where your hair needed serious repair, but expect a small bottle for the price being on the higher side. Bottom line, it really works and I would definitely purchase again.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"If this had 100 stars it would get it. I recently had my hair FRIED, it was super gummy after washing, breaking off nonstop, felt like straw dry... in a nutshell it needed HELP!

"After waiting a lot because I bought it on Prime Day and delivery took a lot of days... I used this overnight and the following day my hair was not soft, it was pretty dry and kind of sticky, I washed it again in case some was still on. It didn't change. I am trying it now for the second time,I am going to leave it overnight again. But I am not hopeful maybe it is not for all hair types even tough it says it is, or maybe this one is not the real deal ( my hair is natural salt and pepper)",2,0,B00SNM5US4
"My hair stylist uses Olaplex when highlighting my hair and before Brazilian Blowout and it has made a major difference. After each treatment, my hair stays silkier and appears healthier for longer.

"Heaven in a bottle: I am not kidding when I say that. I slept with this in my hair and had a plastic wrap over it, then in the morning I washed it out as normal ( shamppo and conditioner) and my hair was back to that before I ever died it feeling!

I recommend trying this product.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"Olaplex #1 works so amazing in the salon, but I can’t say Olaplex #3 is really worth the money or effort between treatments. Truth be told, I haven’t seen a difference when using this.

"I’m one of those that uses box dye because I’m not rich and can’t afford to get my hair done every 3-6 months. This product literally fixes my hair ends after just one use.

Doesn’t compare to anything else.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"I never write product reviews, but this stuff is so amazing I feel compelled to. It is the only reason I can even have long hair. Before I started using it, my hair was straggly, thinning, and dried out from aging and from coloring it every four weeks. I was skeptical about purchasing Olaplex because practically every other product people love that I’ve tried did not work on my hair. This changed my hair instantly and so dramatically that I don’t have to use any other smoothing balm or oil on my hair, just Olaplex, shampoo, and conditioner. It makes my hair super shiny, silky, and full of body. I am obsessed. I feel like I have my 20-year-old hair again.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
"This stuff will actually rebuild damaged hair - it has mine, anyway. Olaplex was recommended to me by my hairdresser, and the price was so good on Amazon that I had to buy it. Using it 2 - 3 times a month really makes a difference in how my hair looks and feels, especially since I use hot tools quite often. I highly recommend this stuff. Delivery was fast so that was nice too.",5,2,B00SNM5US4
"Tiny amount for the price so be aware it's only 3oz. I got this because a friend reccomended it. Honestly.... I was expecting so much more. My hair is still dry, doesn't seem to have helped at all. I wouldn't reccomend this product to anyone.",1,0,B00SNM5US4
"This stuff is incredible! I had been bleaching/coloring my hair for 5 years so it was very damaged when I finally went back to brown. My friends and family are surprised by how well it has worked.

I put it on before I get in the shower (when my hair is still dry). Then I do stuff around the house and don’t really track how long it’s in my hair. I might use more product this way but it’s convenient and still works really well.",5,0,B00SNM5US4
I really love this product but am unsure what the major hype is about. There are similar products I use that work just as well for a 1/4 of the price. Maybe I’m just a bargain shopper but I got this on some sort of sale so not too mad about it. Small bottle.. wouldn’t buy again.,4,0,B00SNM5US4
I use this a few times a week to help repair my hair. It’s a small bottle for the price but a little bit goes a long way. Helps make my hair smooth and soft.

"I cannot believe I didn't get the results that a lot of people is getting with this product. I already finished half a bottle and I don't see any improvement in my hair. I even left it once for a night, and the least I left it is 40 minutes, even 3 hours. Very disappointed. I dyed my hair cause I am looking to go gray, slowly, but my hair is very very frizzy, after bleaching and dying it, this product did not help at all. Very expensive and it does not work.",2,One,B00SNM5US4

"This product has helped so much with the frizziness caused by bleaching my hair. I have been using it about once a week (have used it three times total) and already see a vast difference. I also let my mom try it since she has some frizz due to dryness. After just one application, I can see that her hair has gotten smoother toward the ends. Four applications only used up about a quarter of the bottle (though both of us have fine hair), so I feel it is a good value. Very impressed.",5,0,B00SNM5US4

I have very fine hair and over bleached some stands around my face (to the point it felt and looked like dry brittle straw).

Amazing product. Great for your hair. This is not a knock off. This is the real deal. I don't think my hair would be half as long without this product. I am planning on buying more.

My hair is still falling out...nothing will stop that, but the hair that I do have is much stronger, softer and thicker.

"The cost was a ridiculous amount for the small bottle you get. I have thick curly hair and this tiny bottle lasted me not even three washes. It does not go a long way. It didn't make my hair soft or smooth or add any benefit to my hair in any way. It's just a fancy name with a big price tag. Put your money to another brand where they give you more for your money, it might work better too hopefully!!",1,0,B00SNM5US4
Been using kinda of off and on so that might not be why it’s working incredibly but I don’t notice a huge change in my hair so I’m not sure it’s really doing anything but maybe if I used it more regularly it would work better,3,0,B00SNM5US4

"I was skeptical at first, especially because I was afraid it could be a fake olplex product, but only one use made me change my mind in two seconds! For the best result, after you wash it away, moisturize your hair!!!! Don't forget to do that or you will not experience the benefits of the product.
For instance, I straighten my hair for years and they looked like dry grass when I was leaving them natural. Olaplex gave me back my natural curls!!",5,0,B00SNM5US4

"I have been using Olaplex since it first became available. I have medium brown, fine hair texture that is tenacious. To be blonde my hair needs a 40 volume bleach for 35 minutes, so obviously my hair needs some repair occasionally. This is the best product to use for damaged hair. I have noticed that within the last 2 years Olaplex has thinned their product slightly, but it still works great. Old stock will be a little thicker. I've seen the same thinning from reputable salons in my area who sell through this product like crazy. I got tired of them being out of stock, so started ordering on amazon.

The directions tell you to use the product before shampooing. I find the best way to use this product is to shampoo twice, towel dry hair quick, apply olaplex, leave in for 10+ minutes, quick rinse, apply your favorite conditioner, leave in for a few minutes, and rinse. There's no way this product would work for me if I didn't shampoo first. My hair needs lots of styling product and that build up needs to be removed first.

Also, if it's your first application, you will need to use 2+ quarter size worth of olaplex. My first application after not using for a while always needs more than the reccomended amount.",5,3,B00SNM5US4

"I LOVE this mascara!! Read a blog on it and figured why not try it for $5 and to my surprise it’s just as good if not better than the $20 mascara I’ve been using! It’s not waterproof but I can wear it all day at work and then to a super high intensity work out class and it still looks great. As far as some of the reviews saying it’s clumpy, the 2nd ingredient in this is beeswax, if you use body heat to warm up the mascara it will go on super smooth! And now, my one complaint: I posted this picture on social media bragging about this mascara. Off of that single post, in the past week probably about 30 of my people have ordered it. I went to order a tube for my friends mom last night and was shocked to see a $15 price tag!!! TRIPPLED in price from 3 days ago!!! So, FYI to anyone wanting this but not wanting to spend $15, ulta still has it for $4.99",5,"1,068",B00T0C9XRK
I would give this ZERO stars if I could! It runs after about 30 minutes of wear giving me raccoon eyes. No use in using a mascara that does that. I will never waste my money on this awful product again! $4.99 is cheap but even that is too much for a terrible product! I’m on an Amazon shopping group and most of the people in the group who purchased this also complained about it smearing and giving dark circles under the eyes so it’s not just one person. The pic I attached shows it after only 30 min of wear. The longer I wear it the worse it looks!!,1,610,B00T0C9XRK
"When I received my mascara it was in an unissued box with a sticker over the seal to show it was new, I'm not actually sure if it was a new bottle. I used it a handful of times, but didn't like it much. It clumped my lashes together, making them look messy and the mascara flakes like crazy!! At night when I go to take it off, it takes FOREVER and even when you think you got it all, you didn't. I don't wear much for makeup and I don't wear it everyday. It had been weeks since I wore any makeup on my face, then 2 days in a row I wore this mascara. Day 1 my left eye was so irritated and by day 2 I had a stye on my bottom lash line that is incredibly painful. I have never had a stye before and I have to chalk it up to it being from this mascara. Not being able to fully clean it off, the flakes, and the fact that I can't say it wasn't used makes me believe my stye is a result of this mascara.",1,483,B00T0C9XRK
"This has became my favorite mascara. It lasts & doesn't dry super fast so you can build it as much as you want. It comes off easily with my eye makeup remover & doesn't flake throughout the day. I also love the wand (this part is huge for me) it glides the mascara on perfectly & seperates my lashes. I tried the purple tube as well & definitely prefer this one (purple has a curved wand where this one is straight with individual spikes). Also the purple curved wand caused me to get as much mascara on my eyelid as the lashes. But I have been using this stuff since January & have not looked back! For the price & quality you cannot beat it!

Edited for pics: First pic (blue shirt) is with the green tube, the morning after! The other eye pic is with the purple tube, still gets the job done I just love a straight spiky wand. I am not wearing eyelash extensions or falsies. Most of what you see is the magic of the mascara! BUY IT SIS!!",5,218,B00T0C9XRK
"After seeing some impressive before-and-after photo reviews of this product, I decided to try it out. Weighing the pros and cons, it's a good mascara- great even, considering the price point.
Some cons include that this product goes on very wet and thick. When applying, I make sure to tilt my head back and look down at my mirror so that there is a smaller chance of my eyelashes brushing against my upper lids. I hold this position for about 30 seconds to let it dry a little before moving on to the next eye, otherwise it will smear all over the lid. I have long lashes, so perhaps not everyone will face this issue.
You can build up a good deal of product in one round of application, rather than going back to reapply after it dries. It is a tad bit clumpy, but it isn't a ""spider legs"" look by any means . It looks nice with a little practice mastering an application technique. I will mention that I did not like this mascara at all the first day I tried it, it was far too wet and I felt it just clumped everything together. However, I'm sure others have noticed how a day one mascara applies is generally not a true test to it's intended effect.

I would encourage anyone to give it a shot for this price, you'll most likely either love it or you'll think it's acceptable at best . I would most likely buy this again; although I admit this was a bit of a novelty purchase, I am impressed.",4,390,B00T0C9XRK
I bought this mascara after reading an article on Facebook about it. It does work wonders!! I personally think it’s as good if not better than my Younique fiber lashes and it doesn’t flake off like that does! I used 2-3 coats and my lashes look amazing. Just like falsies. Great product,5,308,B00T0C9XRK
"I NEVER write reviews unless I either really love something or hate it. I LOVE THIS MASCARA. I am a mascara fanatic, I buy mascara constantly and always try and find the best one.
So, this mascara is super cheap and the best one I've bought so far. In the pictures I posted, I didn't use any eyelash primer or curler and just put two coats on!!! I was so impressed! But it also depends on how long your eyelashes are and if you apply mascara correctly. My eyelashes are not super long naturally but I apply castor oil daily to strengthen them which helps.
This mascara doesn't clump (unless you don't know what you're doing) and it has great volume and thickness. You can use one coat to be subtle or you can keep building it up. It also lasts all day.
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS, especially since the price is so cheap! It's a steal. Better than all the higher end mascaras I've tried and the drug store ones. I will most definitely be buying another one when my current one runs out.",5,127,B00T0C9XRK

I was excited to try this because I saw it on a blog review. I don’t know who they paid off.... so it started out looking nice had good build up looked nice and thickened my lashes..... 4 hours later it looked like I had gone swimming and rubbed my eyes. Seriously so bad. I’m just glad I was our with friends and not at an event so they could tell me I need to go fix my mascara. Save your money and pay a little more this is the worst mascara I’ve boight.,1,63,B00T0C9XRK
"I bought this mascara because it had been highly hyped by a few different fashion bloggers. Sadly, I did not experience the same love affair as them. I hate the packaging. It is literally just a tube, no wrapper, no seal, no cardboard. This worries me because how can you tell if it has been tampered with or used??? I would gladly pay $1 or $2 to know I’m not risking pink eye for long lashes. That alone makes me want to keep looking for another mascara, but so far I’ve been pink eye free after using 1.5 weeks! I like that it is a brush applicator as I seem to have horrible luck with the silicone bristle brushes. It is a tapered brush which helps you really get into the edges and the smaller lashes. Unfortunately, almost too much comes out on the brush and it’s hard to get off and I’ve ended up with clumpy lashes that I’ve had to redo. I would probably use a different mascara if I were applying in a rush or in a car or somewhere I would be unprepared to possibly have to redo my lashes. Maybe it will be better after the tube has dried a bit. It does tend to rub off below my bottom lashes leaving me with darker circles than I already have :( (co-sleeping 2.5 year old) My photo is after I’ve had the mascara on for 6hrs or so, running errands, so you can kind of see some of the under eye darkness. Sadly, I will keep looking for my perfect mascara",3,52,B00T0C9XRK

It takes every makeup removal out there to take it off. It makes no sense how in one hand it smears and then on the other it won’t come off. I would not recommend this product",1,59,B00T0C9XRK
"Five bux for mascara? Can this be good? Well, yes...and no.

The large, long black plastic tube is shaped a bit like the bust and hips of a woman, with a flared top and puff paint, sort of a corset design (! lace in back, heart-shaped bustier in front outlined in aqua rubbery paint) The puff design lets you grip the top and screw it open. So far, so good.

The wand on this version (not waterproof) is straight and thinner. Not a teddy bear style brush. More like Lash Dimension from L'Oreal.

The mascara ink itself is thick and very black but wet, not dry.

One swoop across my lashes and they were definitely longer and blacker, not volumized but thicker for sure (not as thick as L'Oreal Voluminous, which is my go-to drugstore mascara.) Good separation. Overall, the look was just as I like my mascara to look.

One swipe application is full on with only a touch up of the corners to put on a complete coat of black mascara.

Now the not-so-good. It flakes. At first, I thought it must be a tubing mascara (apparently it is not) because I had little short straight flakes under my eye after a short nap.

It seemed to come off easily enough. I washed my face with my usual Garnier Refreshing Facial Wash with Aloe and no trace is left. I'd say also, I had it on all day on a hot day so by the end of the day it seems to be mostly gone. I'm thinking it would make raccoon eyes or much smearing underneath if you put it on and took it off right away. Nor does it seem to last, say, sixteen hours. You'll be touching it up after eight hours.

Another note: if you use shimmery eye shadow, it will end up clinging to this mascara. Even after it dries. So it doesn't seem to dry right away or it stays a bit tacky. Shimmery or glittery shadow dusts off quite a bit and it really coated my lashes visibly which some mascaras do not do.

So... fairly good formula for application, goes on a treat. I did not get eye irritation, which I am prone to. But seems to flake. Er.... flaking is not cool. I loved the way it made my lashes look and it's no fuss to apply and cheap as can be (cheaper than the typical eight bux drug store brands unless there is a BOGO sale happening) but flaking is so Not. Cool. This is like thinking I'm buying a bargain Princess Diana but getting Duchess Meghan (beautiful! but high maintenance?)",,24,B00T0C9XRK
"Let me start by saying that I have puny lashes and have tried too many mascaras in every price range and this is the first one that shocked me when I looked in the mirror. You could actually see my lashes and they looked good! The ONLY negative, and the reason for four stars, is that it is gloppy. I need to wipe the brush several times to remove as much product as I can and then go over my lashes with a dry brush to separate my lashes. This is a minor inconvenience though to get gorgeous lashes.",4,36,B00T0C9XRK
"I have always used Lancome mascara's. Because I have very fine/short eyelashes I use their cls booster in addition to their best volumizing mascara in order to create the fuller/longer effect. After reading about this product in a magazine I decided for $5 it was worth finding out if it was as good as its reviews. Not only is it as good as Lancome's products, its BETTER!! I don't even need to use the booster b4 applying it. I have now purchased this product multiple times & the result is always the same. It provides the effect of full, long lashes!!

In a few reviews I've seen complaints about it going on clumpy. I have not had this problem. Keep in mind that in order for this product to provide the effect it does, beeswax is the 2nd ingredient. Beeswax will clump if cold. Just rub the bottle in your hands for a minute & there will be no clumps!!

I will continue to purchase this mascara & save the extra $70 I would normally have paid for my 2 Lancome products.",5,23,B00T0C9XRK
"I decided to try an inexpensive mascara, since we wash it off every night. I LOVE this mascara 😻 !!!! I took a photo of one eye with this mascara (blue arrow eye) and the other with a $32 mascara (Charlotte Tilbury). My husband could not tell the difference and I think this mascara (marked with blue arrow) looks better and the lashes are longer. FYI-I have a bald spot of lashes gone from using Charlotte Tilbury's mascara (the eye with the arrow) and still this eye looks better with Lash Princess. I have not had any lashes lost from Lash Princess Effect Mascara. GREAT 👍 mascara!!!",5,17,B00T0C9XRK
I wanted to love this mascara but it just wasn’t great. It really did give my lashes volume and length but they got clumpy and stuck together all the time. It was hard to remove with soap and water (I don’t use makeup remover so that may be why I struggled but my go to mascara rinses very easily without it) and it usually had smudged quite a bit by the end of the day. The worst part was the reaction I had to it. My eyes would get really puffy and start to hurt and then get really bloodshot. Nothing worked to get the irritation to calm down not even clear eyes drops and ice packs. It took a couple days for my eyes to return to normal and stop hurting. I used it multiple times and every time I had this reaction. I don’t feel like my eyes are overly sensitive but something about this product just did not agree with me.,1,14,B00T0C9XRK
"It’s great if you love the look of Spider leg eyes 🤷🏻‍♀️

Very clumpy. Smudges and runs at any sign of moisture. Unless you’re trying to take it off. Suddenly it’s impervious to many methods, so you resort to the “pinch and pull” method with your wipes, losing a few eyelashes in the process.

Also, it’s not very eye friendly. I don’t have sensitive eyes either. Wish I could return or speak with the seller. Thinking I received a bad tube as many friends order routinely and it works beautifully for them.",1,25,B00T0C9XRK
Product came without a box or wrapper. I still gave it a chance HORRIBLE MISTAKE!!! This was clearly used barely had product on the wand after several swipes. I wish i never bought this,1,46,B00T0C9XRK
"So, When I wore, it was warm outside and I was sweating a bit, nothing serious. I went to a meeting with my financial planner. He knows I’m a cheapskate. I sat down, removed my sunglasses and his mouth fell open. I had streaks and raccoon eyes like I’ve never seen before. I was so embarrassed. Then I laughed so hard because he called me out on trying to save a buck and slipped me a $20 to go treat myself to some decent mascara!",1,18,B00T0C9XRK
"Love this mascara! I’ve used the “best of the best” designer, super hyped, ultra popular mascara available and NOTHING compares to this stuff! I don’t even bother using a lash curler anymore! I buy 2 at a time so I always have a spare (yes, it’s that good!!). I highly recommend this particular mascara... it goes on effortlessly, it lasts pretty much all day, and the price?- I feel like I’m almost stealing it! I’d give it a 10 star if I could!!!",5,15,B00T0C9XRK
"Falsh Lash Effect is very clumpy when applied. I had to use an eyelash comb/separator to remove the clumps. At first I thought this was no big deal since I was able to remove the clumps and the mascara did succeed in making my eyelashes look a bit longer. However, just a few days later, I developed the first stye I've ever had in my life. My eyes are not usually sensitive but I thought perhaps it was a fluke and maybe I hadn't taken my makeup off carefully enough. I was very conscientious thereafter about really making sure I thoroughly scrubbed my makeup off before bed. Nevertheless, I soon developed my second ever stye in my other eye that was even worse! I had to go to the eye doctor. The only thing that was different/new in my daily routine was that I had started using False Lash Mascara, so I surmise the mascara caused the styes. I then read other reviews complaining of the same issue. Buyer beware- irritated eyes does not make this mascara worth it.",1,12,B00T0C9XRK
Unfortunately it doesn't really work as advertised. I'd say inaccurate description. Plus it was already opened. The sticker was pealed off and the barcode sticker you apply was on the bubble wrap. It was unsettling and unprofessional. I did try it because the reviews were positive. It does run and does not hold curl or give volume as advertised. I have long lashes and use many make up product lines to know whether or not this product is being advertised accurately. I was hoping for a better experience and professional/safe packaging.,1,16,B00T0C9XRK
"*EH HEM*
I left my original review below to maintain transparency HOWEVER. My tubes I bought went into the trash today. I bought two thinking I’d love it so much I’d have the 2nd waiting when I used up the first tube. I had used the mascara sparingly because I’m home and don’t have much reason to apply makeup daily....WELL, after having used the mascara several days in a row (cleansing off each evening) I have massively irritated eyes (pink-ish/ red and they’re burning) and I have two, yes TWO, styes on my right eye, one on the top lash line and other on the bottom. NOT HAPPY. I’ve used countless drugstore and higher end mascaras and have mixed brands for sake of multiple coats to achieve my desired look and never so much as mild irritation. I look like Frankenstein now. My advice is, try it if you want, there’s obviously people out there who it doesn’t bother but for me... I wound up being one of the unfortunate ones.
So0oO0... 0/10 will NOT buy or recommend again.

I know there’s some mixed reviews out there but I give this mascara a 10/10 TBH. There must be an ingredient that many are sensitive too but it doesn’t irritate my lashline or eyes whatsoever. I use mascara primer first and then two coats of this bad boy and I love how my lashes look!! I will absolutely be buying again!",1,6,B00T0C9XRK
"This mascara surprised me. My first impression was not good. The mascara came in medium size box and delivered on time. The mascara itself was not packaged. If you would buy in stores the mascaras are packaged where you can’t open them. It didn’t look used but this might determine if I buy Essence mascara again. I don’t know where it’s been so please consider packaging your product.

The reason I gave them 4 stars is because I am very pleased with the results. I was hesitant to apply the mascara due to it being unpackaged but I decided to give it a try. The humidity is crazy right now and the mascara doesn’t smear. Other products smudge when it’s hot but so far no issues with this product. There was no clumping and it was very easy to clean off with a makeup remover wipe. Very pleased with the product itself, just not with how it was packaged by Essence.",4,8,B00T0C9XRK
"I was blessed with thick eyelashes. The problem is they’re so short you can hardly see them. This stuff fattens my lashes up and gives them a little bit of length to make my eyes pop. Wearing false strip eyelashes is no fun to me as I hate the way they feel on my kids. I usually wear individual lashes but haven’t felt like gluing them on. This works great for those days when you want lashes that pop but don’t want super dramatic falsies. Be careful though, it does clump and crumbles off if you touch your lash and the. Crumbles can easily fall in your eyeball. Not fun. But I am wearing about 8 coats in the photos... so yeah.. crumbles.

Overall pretty impressive mascara for $5, that can easily compete with the high end mascaras from the department store!!",4,6,B00T0C9XRK
I really wanted to love this mascara. The previous reviews are great for such an inexpensive product. I had my hopes up! But unfortunately I’m not completely impressed. It smears way too easily under my eyes But I discovered that using it as a mascara “primer” under my waterproof mascara works pretty good! It adds thickness and length to my lashes and the waterproof mascara on top locks it in and prevents the dreaded raccoon eyes. Not sure I’d buy it again though. I think I’ll keep looking for a waterproof version of the same thing.,2,13,B00T0C9XRK
"The mascara is pretty good at giving length. I wouldn’t necessarily say it’s great for volume, as it can sometimes clump my lashes together if I’m not careful, but length for sure is its strong suit.

However, no matter what i do, it tends to leave smudges along my browbone. (It makes my lashes long enough that if i open my eyes wide, yes, my lashes do hit my brow.) It’s a little less noticeable on cool days, but if I do any sweating at all, it smudges. Primer or no primer, it’ll leave black smudges along my browbone.

For the price the length is quite nice, but at least for me, the smudging is bad enough that i don’t think I’ll repurchase.",4,5,B00T0C9XRK
I just received the mascara and there is no safety shrink wrap on it. Is this normal? I'm nervous to use it!,1,24,B00T0C9XRK
I gave my daughter the waterproof because I don't like removing waterproof mascara. I tried the regular. It's a no for me. It looked good at first but after a couple of hours it was smeared all over around my eyes. I didn't rub them so it just literally melted and transferred everywhere. I'm glad I didn't try this on a workday where I would have had to see clients looking like a raccoon. I will stick with my usual lash paradise.,2,7,B00T0C9XRK
"My lashes are nearly invisible without mascara. I've tried so many mascaras. Even high end ones left me disappointed. Saw a youtuber rave about this one and BOOM, I'm in love! Recently, loreal came out with a new one (rose-pink packaging; can't recall name ) that everyone was raving about. Curiosity got me and I dropped $10 to see if it could beat princess... nope. Close, but no. Oh, and I do cheat with define-a-lash (mabeline?) to comb out lashes before & after princess, but I do that with any mascara because mine are so puny.",5,22,B00T0C9XRK
"This mascara is terrible. After the hype and good reviews I saw I was really hoping to love it. Wow was I disappointed. The formula was dry and clumpy right away. I added a few saline drops to wet the formula and it helped a bit. Not only was this mascara dry and clumpy, it flakes all over and leaves black marks below my eyebrows from product transfer. It is also VERY difficult to remove. I usually use water and makeup removing wipes and that is not enough for this mascara. I end up losing lashes every time I remove it. Overall, I'd never repurchase this, even for the $5. Use your $5 elsewhere.",1,8,B00T0C9XRK
"I'd read good things about this mascara various places, but it didn't do anything for my lashes that I don't get with my go-to L'Oreal mascara (and is worse in wearing). At first I thought essence Lash Princess was good, as it does lengthen lashes, but after only a few hours of wear, it flakes and smudges, and doesn't hold lash curl either (and tends to be clumpy). I've given it a good month or two, but I'll be throwing it out, as it's not worth using, or buying again when you can get a more reliable mascara for a few dollars more (or the same price). Obviously lots of people have other views, but for me this didn't work.",2,10,B00T0C9XRK
"This mascara definitely works well. As I am getting older (48) I have been noticing the thinning of my eyelashes, yes ladies... so MUCH to look forward to in the aging process.
I contemplated having extensions added.... but, I am not willing to pay the reoccurring price. Also... due to social distancing and the safer at home restrictions, we are all facing, that is out of the question anyway. SO... how does one attempt to look their best for Zoom meetings under these conditions?!? I had to go in search of a new mascara! The reason I took away one star is that my eyes are watering constantly. I don't know if this is a reaction to the mascara or due to the fact that the current pandemic has me teaching via my computer... tons more exposure to blue light, etc. I do love this mascara though... it's so affordable and does the job. No clumping, and I feel like it provides lengthening and volumne.",4,7,B00T0C9XRK
Not in tamper proof packaging. The tube looked like it was beat up and wand may have been used. Threw it away.,1,22,B00T0C9XRK
"I liked it at first, it really does elongate your existing eye lashes. Easy to put on, no clumping, easy to wash off. However, 2-3 weeks into using it, I noticed it started to clump more. Then I started having eye irritation. I thought at first maybe it was eye strain because I work on a computer 8+ hours but then when I really pay attention. One morning I was running late and didn't put my makeup on until I got to work. Before I put the mascara on my eyes were fine. After I put it on within an hour my eyes were hurting like I had been up all night starring at a screen and my eyes were notably red. I went to the bathroom and washed off the mascara. Within an hour after that my eyes were back to normal and not hurting. I know mascara has to be replaced every 2-3 months due to bacteria growth but it hasn't even been a month since I started using this mascara. Will not be purchasing this mascara again.",1,6,B00T0C9XRK
"I liked the way it goes on but unfortunately it makes my lashes uncurl in 10 seconds flat :( Since I need to curl them so they will show, that negates the whole thing. My lashes are long but you can only see them from the side. I also tried using my regular mascara (which did not uncurl my lashes) and then going over it with the Lash Princess to see if that would keep it from straightening my lashes, but no. The same thing happened. Such a shame.",4,13,B00T0C9XRK
Was not even able to try product as it arrived looking already used. Had a seal sticker that attempted to make it look new however the applicator wand had clear been pumped in the tube and used! Couldn’t return so I had to just immediately throw it away. Very disappointed as I was looking forward to try this product.,1,13,B00T0C9XRK
Love love LOVE this mascara!! I was so surprised how long and full my lashes look! It’s so worth the money. I’ve bought expensive mascaras and haven’t been nearly as satisfied. I’ve ordered 4 within the last year and will order more!! I hope they never discontinue this brand...that’s how much I love it!,5,8,B00T0C9XRK
"I've had this mascara in my cart for the longest time. Finally decided to try it out and I AM IMPRESSED!!! Super lengthening and volumizing!
I've tried about 80% of drugstore mascara and would only repurchase one kind. This exceeds that one kind, by far! New favorite for sure!
It does transfer to under my eyebrow by the end of the day, which is not something I've had with any other mascaras I've used. That's my only negative. This mascara is not for no-makeup-makeup days lol it's so extra and I love it!",5,6,B00T0C9XRK
"I purchased the orange font tube (Lash Princess Volume) first and had a great experience with it, and received many compliments on the mascara.
Then after it dried out, I really wanted to try this green False Lash Effect mascara because I heard it was the best offered by Essence. I'm not sure if I got a bad tube or what, but I don't see what all the hype is about. It clumps easily, ends up in my eyes a lot, and is really hard to remove, almost like it's a waterproof formula. I didn't have any of those problems with the Volume formula.
It isn't a horrible mascara by any means, but I don't understand why this is their most hyped formula. Definitely give the orange one a try instead if you're considering this one.",3,11,B00T0C9XRK
"I had seen this mascara many times in makeup tutorials with people raving about it. I finally gave it a try and my gosh this is a really nice mascara for the inexpensive price! It's a very buildable mascara which is nice and really gives a ton of volume and length. It does take a little longer to apply then the mascaras I'm used to but worth the patience to get it just right. I'm used to buying mascaras well over $20 and this one is a fraction of the cost with great results. The only thing I do not like is it lasts roughly 10 hours and that's it. Then it starts to rub/flake off. My makeup goes on for work at 5:00am and then I start noticing a little dark undereye from the mascara by 2-3pm. However, I do have sensitive eyes and everyone is different. Maybe the waterproof one won't do that so I'll definitely give that one a try eventually. Overall, this mascara is definitely worth the buy.",4,3,B00T0C9XRK
"Lash Princess will now be my go-to mascara! It's easy to apply and makes my lashes look great (I'm 73 years old). I will use a brush afterward and reapply if I want more of a dramatic effect. There is no caking! During the day, there are no problems with flaking. I've had problems with flaking and it's hard to find a mascara that doesn't flake. This mascara has not been harsh on my lashes and I use Ivory soap, or another gentle cleaner, to remove the mascara without any problem. I definitely recommend this product for young and old!",5,5,B00T0C9XRK
"I’m REALLY loving this mascara! I have very short and thin eyelashes and this mascara really gives them the volume and length I so desperately need!! I was a LOYAL user of the L’Oréal Voluminous mascara (for a decade, at least)... and this one is really giving it a run for its money - and it’s half the cost! It flakes just a little, but that may be due to the number of coats I use - which I’m realizing more than two coats may not needed. Overall, happy with the purchase. I’ve recommended to others to try and will continue to purchase.",5,3,B00T0C9XRK
"Essence mascara is my fav DIRT CHEAP secret weapon! I have tried ALL of them! This formula and brush is decent, I have been previously using the princess lash but in the purple tube with curved wand. This mascara does not provide volume, but its one of their better formulas that stays all day without flaking. It is great for LENGTH, if you apply correctly! Tips first, then wiggle base and bring upwords. I use this in combination of I L0VE EXTREME VOLUME , that actually provides volume. My very favorite mascara by essence is in the pink tube, LASHES OF THE DAY. This formula is thee blackest of the black and looks uhhhhh-mazing!!!! For about 2.5 (2 hrs) seconds until it flakes off in my eye sensitive eye balls 😭😭 I tried 5 different types of setting sprays to help stop the mascara from flaking, too no avail. So I had to stop using it... Broke my heart 💔",4,4,B00T0C9XRK
"--I have used many different kinds of mascara over the years. I typically wear little to no make up, but when I do, I love mascara. Unfortunately most eye products irritate my eyes. The get itchy, red, and feel tired (even though I am not). Sometimes it is within a very short period of time, sometimes a few hours later. Either way, it sucks trying to find a mascara that doesn't make my eyes feel terrible. I don't recall what brought me to this product, but I gave it a try based on the write up and the budget friendly price (less than $5).
--Well, after initial use, I could tell that it was going to be one of the few mascaras that doesn't highly irritate my eyes. --YAY! Another annoying thing about trying to find a good mascara- finding one that doesn't smear. Not just flaking, but actual smudges and smears. It is terrible to perfectly apply eye make up, look great upon completion, only to find later that the mascara didn't dry, and I've been walking around with racoon eyes. This formula doesn't seem to smear. YAY! (for other mascaras that I didn't want to throw out, I just made sure to lightly powder my lashes to help the mascara to stick).
--Lengthening. Who doesn't want some added length? This formula clearly adds some length. See included pics! I didn't apply it to heavy, I didn't have another product added in. I just did a couple of quick swipes then took a picture. One with one eye done, one with both. Clearly a difference. I imagine if I were more careful and methodical in my application, I get more length or volume. YAY! BUT, that brings me to..
--Now, the one other thing that bothers me about mascara, is that some will clump quickly, so it can be difficult to apply carefully when the product wants to bulk up in spots. Sometimes it can be helped by wiping off some of the product from the wand before application, but that can hinder layering it on. It is a fine line between applying it thick and having it clump. This product is quick to clump and/or deposit too much at once in haphazard way. Some people LIKE the look of clumpy lashes, or lashes that look like they are clearly mascara caked. I am not judging, and it is totes cool if that is the look you want because this mascara will help you achieve it. I am kind of in the middle. I want to look like I am wearing mascara, but I don't want it to be glommed on to to where it looks dry and spidery. Hard to describe, but look at other peoples review pics to determine if this mascara will do what you want it to in terms of looks. With a light touch, it can look like basic lash darkening mascara, it is just trickier to get the dark/thick/and length without it going into clump/stick/harsh look.
--While I don't often bring price into my review, I do want to say that at the <$5 price point, I would consider buying this again. More than that, probably not so much. It works well enough, and doesn't bother my eyes.
--For those that ask about the packaging, it is sent as a loose tube without wrap or extraneous packaging. it has a sticker where wand meets the body of container. Simple.",,4,B00T0C9XRK
"So I had heard a lot about this by makeup artists, so I wanted to give it a whirl. I don't get what the hype is all about, this is just your average run of the mill mascara. It clumps very easily, which is super annoying to me. I don't care how long it makes my lashes, if they're clumpy, it looks crappy, mkay? The only, only thing I liked about this is that it didn't smudge or have any fallout throughout the day. Other than that, it doesn't do much. Good to keep in your purse for a touchup if you're out all day, that's about it.",3,4,B00T0C9XRK
"Mascara is the one makeup product that I HAVE to have. You know, if I was on a deserted island and could have only one makeup product what would it be... it's mascara. I have bought so many different brands of mascara over the years and to-date, essence Lash Princess is my favorite. And for the price, it cannot be beaten.

It comes in two types, but I've only tried the False Lash Effects. This mascara lasts all day, doesn't smudge and I've never had it clump up on me. For everyday use this is my go-to mascara and so thankful I found it. I will be a repeat customer for sure.

The only con is that it comes unsealed. It had a sticker across one side showing it was new, but no packaging or plastic wrap/shrink wrapping. I think this is another way they keep the cost so low, though... maybe. I still love this mascara.",5,7,B00T0C9XRK
"NOT A FAN. I have really thin lashes and have struggled to find that false eyelash look without without hassle of actually using false eyelashes. I actually found a brand that I loved, but was running out and this popped up on my suggestions. I've seen it in buzzfeed articles and beauty bloggers hawk it all the time, so I thought I'd give it a try. The mascara formula is thick, which probably helps create that fuller fake look, but even with a very thin application looked goopy and clumpy on my eyes. I spent more time trying to remove the clumps and clean up my face than I did with one initial brush. It smears easily, which is an issue when it's so thick. It got everywhere... and I had only done one sweep on one eye. I've given several shots and have had similar results every time. When I finally got the application down (after essentially removing all of the product off the wand), I really wasn't impressed with the results. My lashes are darker and thicker, but there is nothing ""false"" looking at all. Meh. Save yourself the hassle and cost and get some real mascara from a beauty counter, not this gunk.",1,One,B00T0C9XRK
"I have long eyelashes that are so light that you can’t see them when I don’t have mascara on. I am extremely picky about mascara and I’ve tried almost every expensive brand and store brand available. Even ones that get good reviews, I usually do not like because they clump, or I look like a raccoon, or it flakes off. I do not use waterproof mascara because I like to be able to wash my face and remove my mascara in one step rather than having to use make up remover as a separate step. Hands-down this is the best mascara I have ever used. And it’s only $4.99. Unbelievable! I used it for the first time yesterday and it never flaked, it didn’t clump what I put it on, and no raccoon eyes. The first picture shows my left eye without any mascara and my right eye with this mascara only on the top lashes. The second picture is with only one coat of this mascara on all my lashes. I do not use false lashes or lash inserts. Highly recommend this mascara.",5,4,B00T0C9XRK
"This is the best mascara I have ever used, hands down! I've run the gamut from cheap drugstore brands to high end department store brands, and none work as well as this. I've had friends ask me if I'm wearing false eyelashes and where I got them because they look so natural! They really do lengthen and thicken the eyelashes. I thought I might have to scrub it off with an oil-based makeup remover, but was happily surprised to wipe it clean with micellar water and a cotton ball, I'm hooked!",5,3,B00T0C9XRK
"I bought this because it was such a cult classic in a Facebook group I’m a part of, I had to try it. It didn’t come in packaging or even sealed (which I read is just how it’s made and packaged). I already have semi long lashes so it didn’t do much in making them longer at all. Really just clumped my lashes together. Not smudge proof and left that awkward shadowy mascara mark under my eyes as well as flakes off during the day and kept falling into my eyes. Maybe I got a bad batch but I won’t be buying again. So disappointed after my hopes were high for this mascara!",2,5,B00T0C9XRK
I usually buy very expensive mascara (30+) my friend told me about this kind.... I wasn’t expecting much from a $8.99 (for 2) bottle BUT this is the best I’ve ever used!,5,8,B00T0C9XRK
"For the price, I think it's a pretty good mascara. It is really pigmented and buildable. It makes my lashes pretty dramatic which I like.

The downside to this mascara: My eyes tend to water throughout the day. It's usually not enough to require waterproof mascara, regular mascaras can usually handle it. Not this one. If this mascara gets the slightest bit wet, it will begin to run. Now this doesn't claim to be waterproof, BUT if you anticipate any sort of moisture throughout the day-this mascara is not for you.",3,6,B00T0C9XRK
"I do not like this mascara really. I bought it because a YouTuber I watch occasionally did a video with the highest rated makeup on Amazon. This was, if I believe correctly, the #1 makeup item at the time of her purchase. I usually use Too Faced Better than Sex mascara, and have deviated over the years to that from Marc Jacobs Velvet Noir; also I like Tarte Big Ego and DAMN Girl by Too Faced. So if you’ve used any of those mascaras, you know that they each share a common theme- large wands, which I think work best for maximum dispersion of product on the lashes. I don’t have large eyes and each of those wands works fine, although I’m partial to BTS. Large wands are perfect if the formula is non clumping and isn’t super messy. Ok, back to this mascara. I even bought the two pack thinking it’d be great, as it was lauded to be in the yt video I watched, and I thought I was going to save myself around $25 every month or 2. WRONG. I’ll start with the positive: doing only one coat on my lashes, this stuff separates really well. It has a really skinny brush that somehow grips your lashes and gives them a lot of separation. If you do multiple coats however, and I always do, it starts looking clumpy and making lashes stick together. It’s also a super drying formula. My lashes feel crunchy with this on. I’m used to the really wet TF formulas and some people hate that- I happen to be the opposite and need that wetness to get my lashes to look the way I want. Taking this off is difficult too. My other mascaras remove easily with the Ponds Cold Cream Cleansing Balm I use to take off my eye makeup. I have to do more tugging with this, which I refuse to do. So! I still have both tubes, one unopened. I’ll maybe save it for an emergency but def not my go to",2,3,B00T0C9XRK
"This mascara looks great after applying thusly:
Apply twice to top lashes, dipping wand between applications
Apply once to bottom lashes without reloading wand.
Repeat for other eye.
If the contents seem to be dry and mascara does does glide on with ease don't use water to dilute the makeup. A drop of mineral oil into the tube and then stir it with the wand. Do not try to mix using a pumping action as this will push air into the tube and make the contents even drier.

I do wake up with racoon eyes if I don't remove it before going to bed but I haven't experienced this during waking hours. Unlike most eyebrow pencils (grr!) I don't have to reapply my mascara, even through long hours - daytime and throughout the night - as we sometimes get down here in Las Vegas.

If anyone is having trouble with racoon eyes and/or the mascara becoming crummy (not crummy-bad; I mean the crumbs type of crummy) the mineral oil trick ought to help with that.",5,One,B00T0C9XRK
"My lashes have never looked more full. I used the same mascara for probably 10 years and loved it but decided now that my lashes are thinning, I'll try a different brand. I bought it solely because of the positive reviews and I don't think I'll ever use another brand again.
SIDE NOTE: I recently purchased this product since I'm 55 and your eyebrows and eyelashes start to thin out and it's amazing.

"I am impressed with this mascara considering the price!!! I have purchased at least 30 or more different brands of mascara ranging from 5.00 to 50.00 and this is def a decent mascara. It isn't my favorite but it's a good ""everyday"" mascara for work etc. I will still buy the expensive brands of mascara for special occasions because I can def tell the difference. This mascara doesn't last as long throughout the day as the more expensive brands. I am the type of person who wears mascara EVERYDAY - even on days when I am just going to the gym and running errands so this is a good buy for me and anyone who is on a budget. All in all, I would recommend this product.",4,5,B00T0C9XRK
"There is one makeup item I will sink a fortune into! Mascara! I am getting older and as most older worn do I am losing my eyelashes. I use a good eye lash serum and now I will be using this mascara! I have paid 39.00 for mascara and yet this 5.00 dollar one beats it hands down. It had a brush I love...long and slender so I could get every last hair....and is just hands down amazing. I looked as if I had false lashes on. My husband told me dive times that day I looked beautiful. I am thinking the mascara. It opens your eyes and separates, darkens and adds length and fullness in two coats! I apply one and let it dry them apply another. Best mascara I have ever used in my life and I have used them all! And under five dollars....yes there is a God! Lol",5,One,B00T0C9XRK
"Well I caved and bought this after so many beauty bloggers recommended it. It’s cheap so no harm. Let me preface this review by stating that I have a hard time with mascara. Always have. Every brand I’ve tried flakes off or smudges. I have no clue what’s wrong with my lashes, but none have been ideal. I’ve tried expensive to cheap & see no difference. I even stopped putting mascara on my bottom lashes because of smudges. Okay.., had high hopes for this mascara, but alas, it was the worst mascara I’ve ever tried! Ugh! I literally had smudged raccoon eyes after only 20 min of wear! So that’s it! It looked pretty right after I applied. Oh well. I won’t ever buy it again. Going to give it away.",2,3,B00T0C9XRK
"I wanted to like this mascara, but I just don't. The mascara formula somehow makes your lashes feel like they're coated in rubber. It doesn't do a good job of keeping lashes separated; they all stick together in big clumps. But the worst thing about it is that it's incredibly difficult to remove. I used an eye makeup remover and cotton pad, as I do with all mascaras, and this was the worst mascara to take off. Like I said before, it makes your lashes feel almost rubbery and just doesn't want to come off without some force. I normally wear a waterproof mascara and never have had such a hard time removing it. I ended up pulling out several lashes in my attempt to remove it. I threw the mascara away after a single use.",1,3,B00T0C9XRK
"I've been seeing people rave about this mascara online for a while, so I decided to try it finally. I've used it for the last few days, and it has its good and bad points.
I have long eyelashes, and I am meticulous about mascara application, including separating lashes with a pin. I typically use a drugstore brand with a silicone applicator.
This mascara is thick, and applies a lot on one pass. The coverage is good. The applicator brush, however, is long and makes applying this less precise. It's also a bristle brush as opposed to silicone, which I prefer. So it goes on a little thicker than I'd like. The brush also causes more to end up on my eyelids, which I have to clean up with a q-tip. This formula does not wipe off easily, even when wet, so it can get messy.
It takes me a lot longer to apply this mascara because of the cleanup and lash separating that is required throughout the process. This is why I prefer silicone wands.
I noticed at the end of the day I had a few dots of mascara above my eyelids, where the tips of my lashes hit my brow bone. That's a challenge I've had with several mascara brands.
I also noticed that throughout the day, my lashes didn't all stay separated, and a few clumped together. Also the mascara on the tips of my lashes seemed to wear off a little, so it didn't look as good at the end of the day as it did when I first applied.
I heard washing it off was a challenge, and it was definitely a little bit more difficult than my other brand. It feels more like a waterproof mascara in that way. I was able to mostly wash it off with soap and water at night, but I noticed some leftover smudge in the morning after my shower, which I had to remove with a q-tip and eye makeup remover.
Overall it's a decent mascara, and a good value for the money (so far-we'll see how long it lasts). But I don't think I'll be switching to this one long term. I'll finish this one and go back to my drugstore brand.",3,One,B00T0C9XRK
"I ALMOST didn't buy this mascara because of some of the negative reviews. I am so glad I didn't listen. I was expecting a mess when I went to apply this (per negative reviews) but no. It went on just as smoothly and easily as any other mascara I've used. I've used Mabelline colossal forever. I've tried thrive, younique, you name it. This just became my ultimate favorite mascara! I was liking Thrive but I've noticed it doesn't do well for everyday use. I can only use it every other day. It just doesn't give a consistent result so I went looking for something other than my go-to Mabelline. I've just found it!! This separates my lashes, glides on, no smudge, great lengthener & volume. Not to be salty but some people just never really learned how to put on mascara correctly. That could be one issue for some as this is a wet mascara. The brush holds plenty of product. If you're one of the strange birds that tries to apply mascara while driving, (please stop) and this mascara is not for you. If you are someone who likes to apply mascara in a rush and only want to dedicate 3 seconds to applying....this mascara is not for you. If you don't want dramatically longer looking lashes this is not for you. Other things I love: the brush, the tube has rubber on it to keep it from slipping out of your fingers and when you close the tube up, it actually ""clicks"" closed. For the price????? This is a STEAL! Don't listen to the negative reviews! Just buy it!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I like this mascara a lot!
I got it because of the price and it had a good reviews, and I'm not disappointed!
My lashes look darker and longer, and it's not clumpy or messy, the wand seems longer than normal but maybe I'm wrong, it doesn't bother me though!
Don't mind my weird face 😂 I'm just not photogenic.
I know my lashes look weird on one of my eyes, it's just a little messed up, that's just because I have a problem with that eye, it's not the make-up!
I definitely recommend this!!
It works better or as good as a lot of Big Brand and expensive mascara that I've used!",5,2,B00T0C9XRK
"It's no better than the mascara I grew up with... All I can guess is that younger women aren't used to a brush with bristles vs. the brushes with the rubber tips that became in vogue for awhile. It smudges quickly - as much as any old mascara brand I used growing up. It doesn't layer well. Just got to get in there well with the first round. It does NOT help curl lashes - they just go straight out. You need to use a curling tool (did you younger gals know about those???) and then it'll do, just like the ones I grew up with. Although, it did smudge for me within an hour our so. Maybe I should give it a 2, but I won't.

BOTTOM LINE? Didn't meet the hype. My Lash Blast mascara is better. Just so-so. And I wish there was a black-brown option. I may not go brown, even though I'm very fair, but straight up black is just too much, even now that I wear glasses. If you're lighter toned, black brown is really a better choice.",3,One,B00T0C9XRK
"The reason that I docked it a star, it was not sealed in any way, shape or form. The other reason, I'm not completely crazy about the brush style. The first photo is one one eye without mascara and the other with one coat of this mascara. The other is both eyes with 2 coats. I think I will see if my Stila brush fits into this tube after I clean it, as I prefer the hourglass shape of that brush and think that they extra bristles would make a better impact on thickness of the lashes.

All in all, for the bargain price of $4.99 as opposed to $23, I'm sold on this.",4,7,B00T0C9XRK
"I hate to tell everyone how great this mascara is, but I just have to!! I have blonde eyelashes & if I don’t wear mascara I look like I’ve got almost no lashes. Not a cute look! But they’re long enough that I don’t need to pay for extensions. I’ve bought expensive brand names from Ulta & department stores, the cheapest ones from Target & Walmart, and everything in between. I read about this one on BuzzFeed & thought “What the heck, I’ll give it a shot for the price.” I’m sold... a million times over! The size of the product is great. I absolutely love that the tube has small rubber designs that function as grips, which is exceptionally helpful when you have moisturizer on your hands. (Why do dumb little things like that make me so happy?!) The handle & the wand are the perfect size. And the mascara itself is incredible. It’s nice & thick, but not so thick it clumps. It covers my blonde lashes with just one coat. It’s a little harder to get off my skin under my eyes when I wash my face, but I’m willing to work a little harder to get it off in exchange for all of the previously mentioned pluses.
Please don’t change a thing about this mascara! The price, the formula, & it’s tube/wand design are the best I’ve EVER found. And to the shoppers of Amazon... please leave some for me!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"This stuff is appropriately hyped. I’m not any kind of a makeup guru (my makeup routine generally consists of “throw on some black eyeliner and mascara” because that’s a low maintenance look that makes my eyes pop) and I don’t want to actually spend money on makeup. This is by far the BEAT cheap mascara I’ve ever used. Normally I just grab some Maybeline or Covergirl when I’m in CVS (I don’t usually pay attention to which one because honestly they’re kind of all the same), but I ran out so added this to my Amazon order. I was SO surprised that it was noticeably different than the “drug store staples.”

I’ve got long-ish lashes to begin with (lucky me!) and this makes them look so long other girls think I’m wearing falsies. Definitely recommend.

Bonus tip: I don’t bother with an eyelash curler, but you can get a similar effect with this if you put on the mascara, and then press your finger against the bottom of your lashes like you’re trying to curl them up (while the mascara is still wet) and hold it there for 20 seconds. Then shabam- you’ve got some lashes that REALLY pop. (Although you’ll end up with mascara streaks all over your finger but it’s easy to rinse off)",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I was so, so excited about this product! It guaranteed no smudging or flaking. well, smudging maybe not so bad, but flaking........just as bad as any normal drugstore mascara. That's why I gave this an overall ""1"". I am 66 years old & for the past like 7 or 8 years I've noticed my usual Maybelline mascara flakes off badly during the day. Not just 2 or 3 flakes but sprinkled all under my eyes so I am constantly looking for that non-flaking product. Just a heads-up if you are like me - I am using a WONDERFUL Mary Kay product - Eyelash primer (clear) & then my Maybelline on top of that......not one flake all day long! I love it! Buying 1 product rather than 2 would be great but have not found it yet.",1,2,B00T0C9XRK
"I really wanted to believe the hype with this mascara - low cost and a billion great reviews I was super excited. Honestly, for the price, it’s really really not bad at all I like the coverage it provides. It gives good volume but there are two mains cons to consider: 1.) I am very picky about mascara wands because they honestly make a world of difference. The wand style is not my favorite, I don’t like how it’s straight and holds a ton of product because it doesn’t evenly distribute across the lash. This leads into 2.) Not clumpy formula but super sticky? I don’t know if that’s the right way to explain it, due to the amount of product the wand collects, it’s super easy for your lashes to not “clump” but stick together here and there which can result in them looking clumpy. Even coming through my lashes before and afterwards doesn’t really fully tackle this con.
Overall, good formula, great price/value, not a holy grail but would grab this mascara if I’m in a bind or need a low cost mascara I can trust. I use this mascara right now but use my favorite mascara wand from another product for it and like how it turns out and looks way more!",4,0,B00T0C9XRK
"**Updated Review**:
2/17/21

So I have to say I am somewhat disappointed. I had gone on the hunt for another mascara entirely when they took this mascara off of Amazon. It went away a few months ago and then recently when I searched for it again, they brought it back so i purchased it right away as it was by far the best mascara I’ve used. A few days into using it, it feels different. I didn’t give the full lash effect like it did before. I checked the wand applicator to see if that was changed and it looks like it has been. The older one I have in the picture on the left looks like the bristles are longer and fuller. The one on the right which is the newer version has shorter bristles. It’s making my lashes look thin and spiked not long and luscious like it used to. I don’t think I will be repurchasing this sad to say. I really really loved it. Unless they fix the brush I won’t repurchase. The formula seems fine though. It’s the applicator I have an issue with. Try it for yourself. Maybe it will work for you, but this newer version I’m not crazy about at all. It’s a shame because it is so affordable and it came sealed and everything.

Older review:
I was a die hard Sephora fan before getting this. I read the reviews and knew I had to try. I was looking for an affordable high quality mascara and after reading all of the reviews I went for it and I am beyond happy with my purchase. I hardly ever write reviews on Amazon but this mascara is soooo worth it! I swear it is a dupe for Hourglass’s Caution Mascara. I used to spend $14 just for a miniature travel size version of that mascara and now I am a totally loyal and devout Essence mascara fan. I will say that when you put it on it does add volume to your lashes as well as length. They don’t get spider like and it doesn’t clump. I will say that it does transfer a bit when you apply it to your top and bottom lashes in the sense that some does end up on your eyelid but it’s nothing that a quick wipe or rub can’t take off. Hence why I took off a star. It does dry rather fast so keep that in mind, but it is still buildable if you want that extra canned out lash look. I definitely recommended this. I knew it was meant to be when I say it reviewed in one of Jessica Braun’s videos on YouTube. It was like a confirmation from the heavens that I needed to get it. Will I repurchase? Probably. There is one other mascara that I would like to try that has received rave reviews but for the price point of this one you can’t beat it. I def recommend you try it out yourself:)",4,One,B00T0C9XRK
"I honestly love this mascara. I don’t usually like buying $20 mascaras because I’d rather spend my money on things I need rather than want. It makes my lashes look really nice. It does clump a bit but it’s not extreme.
I few things about this product. Firstly, my problem is that after a long day, the mascara tends to smear on my eyelids if I sweat. They make my lashes really long so if I open my eyes too wide, it smears a bit off right below my eyebrow but it’s not a lot and easy to wipe off with my finger. Secondly, it is a bit difficult to get off. I usually have to wash my face and lightly rub my eyelashes sideways and then use a makeup wipe to take off the rest. I don’t mind doing this because it doesn’t smudge of wear off during the day if I get my face wet. If you want easy to remove mascara, it’s probably not the product to buy but it does last. Lastly, it doesn’t come with a plastic seal. If you’re freaked out by this, probably don’t get it. I don’t mind because I try not to use plastic. It’s a waste and bad for the environment. But that’s my opinion.
I will be buying this product again. It’s extremely affordable and an overall great product. There is some cons to this item (like almost every item someone buys) but there is also pros. If none of the cons bother you, I’d give this mascara a try. It’s pretty cheap to try out and if you end up liking it, that’s great.",5,2,B00T0C9XRK
"I usually use high end expensive mascara like Christian Dior, Buxom and Tarte. I've also tried a variety of drugstore brands like lancome and cover girl in an attempt to save money. I am a mascara snob because it is the one makeup item I have to wear every day or people tell me I look tired ;)

I am SO happy I found this brand of mascara through a review on BuzzFeed. I love this brand just as much as the high end versions. It completely coats the lashes and definitely gives the impression of length. I'd say it's closest to Dior, but thicker. I definitely recommend trying this brand of mascara.",5,4,B00T0C9XRK
"OH MY GOD!
Honestly I think the picture says it all but I’m going to repeat it. My lashes have NEVER been so big and beautiful. I had get as much of the product off the brush as I could before even applying it and still after one swipe my lashes did that! I’m not kidding! I am notorious for finding cheap make up. My bow pencil is drug store, my bb cream is from dollar tree (sassy chic you can buy the exact same product from amazon for $6), my high lighter is dollar tree and even my lipsticks come from there. But when it came to mascara, oof. I couldn’t keep buying $1 products because they just didn’t do their job. They clumped my lashes together and looked so bad. I ended up buying a $3 one that was even worse! So, I finally did it. And my god this thing is worst $20. It is the best mascara I have ever used and I have ever seen. This is a must-by. I am so in love",5,3,B00T0C9XRK
"I’m used to layering my mascara so that I have volume but not a think or clumpy look. It’s not “bad” per se, but it’s not the usual look for me. The price can’t be beat, that’s for sure!

I don’t dislike this mascara and even though I have some of my usual brand, I’m still using it, and not just to “use it up” since it will probably take a little while to do that.

It’s not easy to remove, and I have had some lashes break if I forget I’m wearing it in the evening and rub my eyes. Fortunately I don’t do that often. The upside of it not being easy to remove is that it stays on, and doesn’t smudge or run easily at all. And while it’s not waterproof, it almost is, but isn’t as difficult to remove as a waterproof mascara can be.

I use makeup remover wipes and then my regular face wash and as long as I pay extra attention to removing the mascara with the face wipes, it’s fine.

Will I purchase again? Maybe? I don’t know? It’s not that much less expensive than my regular mascara, but it is very different. I think it’s just less “my style” but still pretty good stuff!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"This mascara is just great!! The red arrow is Lash Princess and the other eye is my regular mascara MadLash by the Balm which ive used for years!! My lashes arent curled here and both eyes have 2 coats on. I am VERY surprised/happy with the Lash Princess!! Works just as great as my more expensive mascara aaannd its WAY cheaper!! I'm hair that it holds my lashes up without curling. The brush is a regular one so just be careful with clumping, a lash comb would be ideal.

This formula is a bit thicker than my other one so careful with clumping BUT it does a great job. May help to oil/hydrate your lashes the night before for a smoother application. I still like the brush on my other one so I may swap but the applicator does the job. You could definitely apply to add length if you wanted. My lashes are already long but this helps keeping them up without curling first, a problem I've had with other mascaras. Comes off easily with water!

Overall would highly recommend.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"So maybe I got a defective one but wow it was so clumpy coming out of the tube, the entire wand was like a big blob of mascara. I had to scrape off the wand quite a bit then it was pretty clumpy going on as well. But I assume that’s bc the wand was so gobbed full. I like that it is cruelty free and definitely affordable but just a mess to use. (Not sure the pictures accurately show the mass amount of mascara on the brush and tube.)",1,2,B00T0C9XRK
"I honestly don’t know what all the rave is about this mascara. Yes, I get it’s $5. But so many reviews and influencers love it. I found it to be incredibly clumpy. I have naturally full and very long lashes, so was just looking to accentuate them. While I did like that it was very dark and dramatic, it added almost no volume and made my lashes stick together in clumps. It is also almost painful when the mascara wand touches the base of my eyelashes. Overall it’s just stiff and clumpy. Flaked towards the end of the night.

Maybe I over applied, but I looked like Tammy Faye Baker. I’ve used so many different mascaras over the years and I’ll stick to my drugstore Maybelline volume express.",2,One,B00T0C9XRK
"I, like many of you, have tried so many different mascara's in attempts to find the one that makes your lashes gorgeously POP! Let me add, I've also done lash extensions, as well as other expensive salon techniques. Well, after my investments in so many brands out there, I thought ""why not try this at that price"", and after reading all the reviews.
It's true!!! This works!!! It's amazing!!! I have gorgeous lashes at an amazing price of $4.99. Seriously?!!!! Yes, seriously!!! Now, the clump part. What mascara doesn't eventually clump...they ALL do. But, remember due to the wax ingredients, what other people have recommended about heating it up WORKS. So, throw a quick warm blow dry on the tube for any mascara, move the wand around and clumps be gone. I'm not one to typically rate beauty products. But this one I had to, it's an amazing mascara. For $4.99, isn't it work a try?!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I love essence cosmetics, but this mascara is truly awful.

Every time I wore this mascara, I had dark circles under my blood shot eyes-- blood shot because bits and pieces of this clumped up product kept getting in my eyes.

The formula is super drying and heavy. Any curl is lost after applying this-- there is no volume; your lashes just hang there, heavy with clumps. The product instantly starts collecting under your eyes too, causing dark circles. It is so drying, as if you're applying years old mascara. My poor lashes...and eyes. Don't do it to yours.",1,2,B00T0C9XRK
"I really LOVE this mascara. It lengthens, separates and adds volume all in one, which is very hard to find.
My eyes are sensitive and most mascaras I've tried make my eyes sting or water but not this one.
This will clump all over the place if you're not careful and apply too much all at once.
It does dry fast and most days I only put 3 coats because I want to build length and it dries out fast.
This mascara hasn't run or anything but it's not water proof either. If my eyes start watering from allergies then it will smudge a little under my eye but that's about it. The mascara stays on all day until I'm ready to wash it off with soap and water.
My lashes are tiny so what this mascara does for me is a miracle for under 5 dollars.",,3,B00T0C9XRK
"I've always used headliner brands like Mac or Lancome. A friend said the Lash Princess is every bit as good and suggested I try it.

She was wrong. It's BETTER. My lashes are short and need a LOT of help. This product has a great brush that separates as it applies just the right amount. Allows me to layer (because I need the extra boost) but if I had better lashes it would only require one coat. It definitely adds a good amount of length and lasts through the day, no smudging or flaking. Absolutely amazing product and worth 5 times the price.

Hint: I use the Costco Kirkland brand face wipes to remove the mascara and it works really well. My normal liquid just didn't work.

I've left it on overnight and it did flake and smudge little. A little wipe around my eyes because I was rushed - and I wore it a second day!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I was really looking forward to trying this. I’m a mascara snob due to extremely sensitive eyes and prior cornea surgery, but the outstanding reviews swayed me to give this product a try. I was very disappointed to open it and find a thick, gluey mess. It’s so thick that the wand it coated in a thick layer that cannot be removed. Not sure if this is indicative of the quality or some defect, but it was sealed when I received it, so it should not have been able to dry and thicken. Will be returning, and if I try again in the future I will pick it up at Ulta to ensure proper handling.",1,One,B00T0C9XRK
"When is it worth buying something that has thousands of reviews? When it really works! I normally use thrive causemetics as my go to mascara but was getting tired of paying 24 bucks each time. I thought I would see if there was a cheaper alternative and I found it! This stuff lengthens my lashes and doesn't clump and all for 5 bucks! I will be buying this again, and again, and again........",5,2,B00T0C9XRK
"I have super long lashes, but they're thin and pale, so if I don't wear mascara, they hardly show. WITH mascara, though, people often thing I have on fake eyelashes. I've had trouble finding the right combination of thickening mascara that doesn't look clumpy or take three coats. This one is fantastic! Not only cruelty free, but one coat is just fine for normal wear, and a second coat makes my lashes super glam.

I'm glad I ordered two of these, as I know I'll want to keep using it. [My one complaint is that even though I ordered two on in the same order, they came in two separate boxes with plastic filling! What a waste of resources.]",5,2,B00T0C9XRK
"I bought one. I liked it so much, I bought four more to give away. It literally made my lashes 1/4” longer. (I didn’t really measure them, they just looked a lot longer!). I read the reviews. The only time I get “raccoon eyes” is in the morning if I don’t take it off at night. It’s not waterproof, which I like because waterproof mascara feels like wax and clumps my lashes together. I’d definitely buy it again.",5,2,B00T0C9XRK
"I have been searching for a good mascara for months and have had no luck I saw this was on sale and had good reviews so figured I’d give it a try. I was really really surprised most mascaras are goopy the first time you try time and end up getting all over I didn’t have an issue with this one which was a pleasant surprise, the brush is fiber and not silicon another pulse for me, first swipe I was shocked, it covered well and made my lashes look thicker and longer, I waited a few seconds and applied one more coat and that was it! No need to keep going back over them, I haven’t tried to remove it yet but I’m very happy with it and I think my search For the perfect mascara might be over !",5,One,B00T0C9XRK
This product goes on like a dream. Very rich and creamy. The packaging however makes me wonder if it was used and returned before. It arrives with no packaging whatsoever other than a simple plastic sticker that is affixed to one side of the tube 1/2 on the wand and 1/2 on the tube. I was able to pull it off intact use it and put it right back. It seems anyone else could have done this too and returned it and now I have it. Kind of skeeves me out at that possibility. I did use it though and did not get pinkeye so maybe they just have shotty packaging and everyone is honest.,3,4,B00T0C9XRK
"I bought this because of the glowing reviews. I put it on and understood why. My eyes looked great! I was so pleased! Then I left my house. It was a cold day and I was going to be volunteering outside. When I came home, two hours later, I had horrible raccoon eyes. The mascara had smudged all under my eyes in big, black lines. I was embarrassed at how many people I must have talked to looking crazy. I figured I hadn't given it enough time to dry before going outside. A few days later, I went for a long walk in the park. It was cold, and my warm breath was pushing up from my face mask towards my eyes. The moisture caused the mascara to completely come off on its own! I was blinking and suddenly had black lines dangling in front of my eyes. Needless to say, I threw it out after this. I am completely unimpressed!",1,0,B00T0C9XRK
"This mascara is THICK. That's not a bad thing - it's the reason I tried it in the first place. The biggest problem is the wand. It's nearly impossible to get all of the chunks off the wand in order to put it on w/o giant black chunks sticking to your lashes. The wand is relatively thin. I spend at least 30 seconds of each application trying to scrape the extra black chunks off the wand, and that only works some of the time.

I typically use CoverGirl Lash Blast, which isn't that much more expensive. I prefer that product by far. The wand is far superior - in fact, I've washed an old LashBlast wand and I use that to 'clean up' my lashes after I apply this stuff. This mascara also tends to migrate under my eyes by the end of the day.

If you're looking for THICK AND CLUMPY lashes this works. If it had a better wand I'd easily add another star.",3,One,B00T0C9XRK
"This is the mascara of all mascaras. I can't believe the time and money I spent over the years trying to find THE one. I used to sell a fiber lash mascara with a company. It was hot for a while. I loved it and so did my customers. The only problem was the flaking of the fibers ended up on the tops of my cheeks and under my eyes. It even went in my eyes but I ignored it because it looked good . New brands came out that sold similar products for a cheaper price, so that was the fizzle of my mascara selling career.

I then tried lash extensions. It was expensive and time-consuming. I didn't like not being able to wear mascara with it, so I started buying fake lashes. I was getting pretty good at applying them and found a few styles I liked, but I was concerned when a few lashes started coming off. Even when I would try to remove them as gently as possible, they were taking off some of my own lashes. I don't know if I was imagining it, or it was a result of getting older, the lash extensions or the adhesive from fake ones, but my own lashes seemed to get thinner and appear shorter. I started having trouble creating the full look I used to have with mascara alone....even multiple coats.

That's when I started my Amazon hunt and this product came up as one of the best. $4.99 and the option to return if I wasn't happy, it was a no-brainer. I figured compared to the others on the best selling list in the $17 to $25 price range, there was no way this cheap one would work. I read the reviews, looked at the before and after pictures, and didn't hesitate with my purchase.

The day I got this mascara, I also got one that was highly recommended on Amazon for $17. I tried this cheap one first. From the first few Strokes I could tell this was a homerun. With every brush my lashes seem to grow longer. It was truly amazing. I took a picture with this one on one side and nothing on the other. It was pretty fantastic! I tried the more expensive one on the other eye with no mascara. Nope. Big fail. Not even close to being as good as this one. Headed to returnville.

You have absolutely nothing to lose by trying this mascara and it is a huge mistake for you not to. It is cheaper than 90% of the drugstore brands and if you don't like the ones in the local stores, for the most part you can't return them. I plan to buy another one for myself and then 1 for my mother-in-law whose lashes thinned a lot during her ongoing cancer battle.

I haven't tried to remove it yet. I'm one of those women who doesn't stress about taking her eye makeup off at night. Also, like someone else here commented, mine did not come sealed or in any type of box. I know it's not the best to get an unsealed product, but I took my chances and love it. I promise you will too!",5,3,B00T0C9XRK
"I had finally found a mascara that I loved, the only drawback was the price. I had been using that mascara for two years ($24/tube Wanderbeauty Unlashed) and totally in love. I saw this mascara on an Amazon’s top rated article and thought, wow, for that price, I’ll give it a go.

Pros:

goes on just as nicely as my more expensive brand.

Not clumpy.

Easy to build.

Defines and separates lashes.

Easy to wash off.

The only con I have after using it two days in a row, I did get the dreaded ‘raccoon eye’ from the transfer from my lower lashes. I already have issues with tear troughs and dark circles, so having a mascara that creates more shadows isn’t for me.

If you have time to handle touching this up, go for it, it’s a great price and a nice mascara.",4,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I was skeptical when I ordered this...I saw this advertised by a Dani Austin (she's a famous blogger). I decided hey..it's $5! I have tried EVERY mascara out there. I hadn't tried this one. It won me over on the first swipe! The wand works great for little to no eyelashes...it gave me more volume than I got with expensive ""Better than Sex"" Mascara! The kicker is..it doesn't smudge off! And it's NOT waterproof! I hate mascara that ends up under my eyes at the end of the day...this is not that. It stays where you put it until you take it off. I was thrilled with this product and will purchase again! TRY IT!!",5,2,B00T0C9XRK
"This is cheap, for a reason. Not impressed, and not even really worth the cheap price. There are WAY better volumizing & lengthening mascaras out there. It seems like they spent more on the packaging than the actual product. If you can get this to apply in 1-2 swipes to full satisfaction & coverage, you'll be golden! Otherwise, the formula is quite sticky & cakey. I had to try and use 3+ swipes to get adequate coverage & by the third, it was SO caked & clumpy I had to remove it entirely to start over. No luck on the second or third tries, either. It can lengthen a little bit, but I find better results using a lash primer specifically than this product can offer as an all-in-one. The ""volume"" I got was so thick it looked like I'd applied 5+ coats. So, as far as ""false lash effect"" claim goes- that is true! It looks like the cheapest, chunkiest pair of fake lashes an exotic stage dancer would use to offset the lighting effects. I'll stick to my tired & true drugstore brand- wasn't aiming for the cheap, tween learning makeup for the first time image involved or the hassle of application with this one. Just glad I didn't waste more than I did, but I regret it costing more than my usual Maybelline after shipping charges.",2,0,B00T0C9XRK
"It appears that many people actually like this mascara, however, I do not like it. I am not sure if I got a defective tube of it or what. It comes out of the tube in globs onto the brush. It goes onto the lashes in globs as well, even if you have wiped a substantial amount of the mascara off of the brush wand. After I wiped the brush and tried to apply as light of a coat as possible, THEN I had to deal with nearly immediate racoon-eyes! So I would then clean below my eyes the best I could with remover, and check again in a mirror after a little while...and boom, racoon eyes again! It is just terribly messy and ineffective as a mascara. period! I've used many types of mascara throughout the years and this is one of the worst ever. I can not recommend this to anyone.",1,0,B00T0C9XRK
Holy cow...this mascara is amazing! There are plenty of review pics with eyelashes so I'm not posting a pic but this mascara is every bit as good and the Thrive $25 mascara I recently bought. It isn't water proof but it's the best mascara I've used in a long time and it's $5!! I use the same brand primer underneath it as well but if you're on the fence about it...just buy it!! You won't regret it....its amazing!!,5,4,B00T0C9XRK
"I saw the reviews and bought this. It comes out really clumpy even though I try to use a little bit and brush off excess. And then I was rubbing my eye later that day, and it got smudged a little on my eye...
I don't even need makeup remover to wash it off.. It came off just fine with my face wash and warm water...
It is super clumpy.. Maybe my lashes are just not thick enough? I have long but thin lashes.. I was going to return, but I had used it twice so it is just trash now..
The mascara bottle is really cute and pretty though...",1,2,B00T0C9XRK
"Don't mind the bad pictures, I didn't have any other makeup on other than this mascara. I don't have time in the mornings before work to do much so I apply only one quick coat on my blonde lashes and it still looks really great. When I actually put effort into my makeup, this mascara looks amazing! But I wanted people to see how good the quick and dirty application looks with this since we aren't always going all out on our makeup.
I really love that it's gluten free too! I have celiac disease and while I don't tend to snack on my mascara, it does sometimes end up in my mouth (usually because I rub my eyes a lot and lick my fingers later for some reason or another - usually food related), so a gluten free mascara is needed! But I will say this mascara doesn't clump like the other ones I've had so I don't really even need to worry about having those little clump balls fall down my face and into my mouth either!
I know this is not waterproof mascara, but it sure seems pretty darn water resistant! It held strong when I spent the day playing in the yard with my dogs while sprinklers were shooting around. It's also tougher to wash off than other non-waterproof mascaras I've used. I don't buy waterproof because I don't like how long it takes to wash off but this one is worth it, in my opinion, and still not as difficult to remove as actual waterproof mascara. I also love the low price too! Yay!",5,3,B00T0C9XRK
"This is my new favorite mascara, surpassing high end! As long as you properly set your undereyes, or if you don't have overly oily skin, no problem with smudging, otherwise I would've given 5 stars. As far as ease of removal, it IS a BOMB WATERPROOF MASCARA, but if you use a half of a pea-sized amount of baby oil cream/gel/whatever it's called, is plenty for both eyes, then just wipe gently with warm wet wrag, and BAM! No fuss! As for volume, people constantly ask if I got extensions, and I've got those teeny tiny sparse nothingness of lashes; yeah, I stack coats, but it doesn't get clumpy and just looks AMAZING! AND HELLO IT'S LESS THAN $5?! What could you lose? I'll tell you what: your old go-to mascara. Sooo many beauty gurus and influencers are in love with this stuff, and rightfully so!",5,2,B00T0C9XRK
"So my boss actually played a game with me. She sells LimeLife cosmetics, so she put her $22 mascara on one eye and this $4.50 mascara on the other eye and had me choose the better eye without knowing which was which. I couldn’t tell the difference!! Neither could our other coworkers in my office. Both eyes looked full of volume! She texted me a selfie of her eyes again today saying how much she loves this mascara, so obviously I bought it too! I have not even opened mine yet, but knowing how it looks on her, I’ll be delighted! Such an inexpensive price for the quality of the product!",5,2,B00T0C9XRK
"This mascara is amazing! It definitely helps my small blonde eyelashes look very full and long. It is very easy to remove (would be interested to try the waterproof) but very happy with this mascara. For the price and how quickly amazon ships the product, it is definitely worth your money. This mascara definitely makes my lashes stand out more and gives the impression of fake lashes. I receive compliments on my eyes all the time after using this product. 10/10 would recommend to anyone wanting longer, fuller lashes!",5,One,B00T0C9XRK
"I bought this after seeing all the great reviews on amazon. i'm always on the lookout for great mascara. I really liked how this made my lashes look, long and full. The only downside was i ended up with raccoon eyes by the end of the day. I know i could probably avoid this by using lash primer but i just don't have that at the moment. That all being said, my daughter has tried this and the raccoon look does NOT happen to her. This truly is a great mascara if you don't want to spend a ton of money on great lashes. 100% the best mascara for the money, just wish it didn't come off so easily.",4,3,B00T0C9XRK
"I have small eyes but naturally long lashes. A makeup artist friend taught me to slightly warm the metal of my lash curler using the hair dryer because just like our hair, heat helps “set” the lashes. That has worked for me for decades. However, this mascara completely pulls every bit of curl out. Lashes are straight as a board and straight out from my lids instead of gently curled upwards. While the volume on the lashes is nice, the overall look of my uncurled lashes actually makes them look MUCH shorter. My makeup artist friend suggests trying the waterproof formula as historically the waterproof products are the only ones that hold onto that coveted curl. I definitely won’t buy this formulation again as it was hugely disappointing for me.",2,One,B00T0C9XRK
"I ❤️ this mascara!!!
After trying this mascara, you will no longer need false eyelashes!! Other brands out there that claim to do the trick are a total fail for me. This brand is not only Amazing & beautifully packaged, & inexpensive but is super easy to make Amazingly beautiful eyelashes!! At the end of the night, it is very easy to remove with cotton balls and micellar water.

However, it will run if your eyes leak!! So I solved this by also buying the same brand waterproof mascara. The waterproof is lovely. But not as Amazing as the other. I applied this on top of the water-proof and I was fine. That may not work for everyone, but when it is really cold and windy out, my eyes water & it does work for me.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I tried this mascara based on all the other reviews--and was not disappointed! I've always used Lancome Definicils and have felt for the price (over last year) the product isn't as good as it used to be....but, I have wavered on trying something new. I have long eyelashes and highlighting them is one of my best features. I don't like waterproof mascara--too thick and unforgiving! I felt this went on well--even--dark--and thick (but not too thick). Very pleased!!",5,3,B00T0C9XRK
"Never will I ever be without this mascara. I've got short thin lashes and have had a graveyard of mascara that I would constantly give to my friend or daughter because they never lived up to the hype. This is amazing. I will sometimes add a fiber thing with it to make it even better but it's great on its own.

And the price makes it even more ridiculous. I seriously had my doubts but I'm a total fan now after using it. Getting ready to but another tube now. It's lasted three months so far and I use it pretty much daily. I can't tell how much is left but I don't want to risk being without it.",5,2,B00T0C9XRK
"I was skeptical of a $5 mascara. I have used expensive mascara (Lancôme and Younique 4-D lashes) and I’ve used Loreal False fibre lash mascara. For $5...? I’ll use this FOREVER! It gives length and thickness and doesn’t flake. Comes off like a dream and doesn’t sting my eyes or flake into my eyes so my contacts burn. I put on ONE COAT and was hooked! One coat gives you a nice, lengthened natural look for day time...2-3 coats and you get the drama you need for a night out. It doesn’t feel heavy or like spider lashes and doesn’t get all clumpy in random spots. I love this product. I honestly could leave the house in just this mascara for make-up and be fine with it. I like to make my eyes “pop” since we all have to wear these stupid masks, and this mascara is awesome for that!",5,One,B00T0C9XRK
"This is by far my favorite mascara. I’ve bought it so many times but sometimes it’s easier to buy it here on amazon because my closest Ulta is almost always out of it. As far as the product, it makes my lashes so bold and long. I like how dark my lashes it look when I wear it. I will say though, I find it’s not as easy to remove as other máscaras since it is long wearing... if you haven’t found a good eye makeup remover I will suggest Garnier Miscellar Water for waterproof makeup. It absolutely removes this mascara. If you’re unsure about it just know it’s only $5, I’m sure we’ve spend much much more for a crappy one. Go ahead you won’t regret it.",5,One,B00T0C9XRK
"It is absolutely mind boggling that this mascara is so economical but works so well. I feel like a cheater using it, while my friends all buy $40 Sephora mascara that needs triple coats and primer to do what this mascara does in one firm swipe. I don’t want to tell them my secret.

It is a thick, creamy, and slightly clumpy (stay with me here) texture. Takes a minute to dry fully. To address the clumpiness: since this mascara coats your lashes so fully in just one swipe, the ends of your lashes don’t taper to a fine point. You have to do a brush-through with a different wand to separate the lash tips for a more elegant look. I just leave it as-is, I think it gives me a punk flamboyant look.

But baby, if you want subtle this isn’t the mascara for you. It is heavy, bold, and makes your eyes huge. Great for stage makeup or drag, I would think!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I bought 2 last month 1 for my daughter & for myself... it’s a bit clumpy but it does lengthen our lashes, have had many compliments on our lashes. We have recommended it every time but now I am seeing the big price change ($4.99 to almost $15)!!! Please explain the huge difference, I did not purchase it during any special deals....",3,10,B00T0C9XRK
"I didn't know what to expect with this mascara but have been very surprised at how great of a product it is. I was on a search for a mascara that didn't leave little black specs of stuff under my eyes (or smudge) and came across this brand doing an Amazon search one night and figured for the price, why not give it a try. I'm glad I did. I can wear it all day and hardly find any flakes under my eyes like some brands I've tried out there. I also have sensitive eyes and this has not caused any issues in that area. I did find that it can be a little tough to remove but just a word of advice, what's worked for me now to remove it much easier is to use one of those small round cotton pads (like the kind near the Q-tips in stores) and I squirt a little face wash on the pad and run it under pretty warm water (almost hot) and hold it over my lashes for about 30 seconds and it comes right off. So glad I decided to give this mascara a chance!",5,2,B00T0C9XRK
"I was looking at buying another mascara that is three times the price but saw all the positive reviews for this one. There's a global pandemic happening so I'm like...give it a go?! This magical wand arrives wrapped in plastic. The tube is artfully decorated not unlike an iced festive cupcake. The brush is long with bristles which I believe are made of the lost feathers of angel's wings. My lashes now have length and volume...both make the threat of plague, political unrest, and a double hurricane heading this way almost endurable.",5,2,B00T0C9XRK
"I purchased this mascara because of its #1 review rating and the low price. At first i was disappointed because it put so much mascara on my lashes that it made them all look very clumpy. But since then I’ve grown to love it. I’ve learned that you need to get some of the mascara off of the application brush by inserting the wand in and out a few times. This makes it so there isn’t as much mascara on the wand itself and therefore less product gets on my lashes. So I’ve noticed this works so well and my lashes do not look clumpy or caked on anymore. I’ve very happy that I discovered this little trick now because this mascara makes my lashes look so long and beautiful, almost like fake lashes. The price is amazing and the mascara tube itself is super cute. It is not the easiest mascara to wash off though. All in all I Definitely recommend this essence mascara! Give it a try!",4,One,B00T0C9XRK
"I ordered this because I read an article from some beauty-related newsletter saying that it was better than $30 mascaras. I can't tell you how much I spend on mascara, but let's say it's easily $300 every six months (they have to be replaced every 3). I tried this thinking maybe I could slash my beauty budget.
Maybe.
My lashes are definitely lifted and fuller, and they're beautifully separated. Definitely a good buy! I will be buying again.
The only thing I don't like is the tip of the wand... a couple of those $30 mascaras have a rounded, fully-bristled tip, so I can use it vertically to get ny inner corner lashes, too. Other than that one tiny inconvenience... this mascara is fantastic!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
This mascara I bought because looking at reviews everyone seemed so thrilled by it! I did notice the pictures people's eyelashes looked clumped on but I also saw people trying to make there eyelashes way longer then they were so I figured ok mine are naturally ok in length it will be fine!.......heck no unless you wanna have tarantula spider eyes! It's thick an the mascara only gets thicker each time you use it! On your eyes it never looks right from day one... I kept trying different things I tried to wipe the wand off completely an shove it back in.... I tried to dap it on toilet paper to lessen it... Nope nothing helps this stuff just sucks...don't be pulled in by all the gluten free vegan stuff...thinking ok a more natural one an happy reviews....if you want to not look like you had a very long night out lol every morning you apply don't buy this!!!!!! It will lengthen you lashes but so do so many other brands...this is to thick on the lashes it's not pretty you do not look pretty..an none of the pictures look cute for it...that's not how mascara should look girls!!!!,1,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Bought this after reading so many rave reviews on a popular blog, as well as great reviews on Amazon. I’m glad I got it on sale. I won’t buy again. The formula is thick and very heavily pigmented, but that is all it has going for it. Applicator is cheap and doesn’t distribute product evenly. I have tried it multiple times, in various environments... hoping I would like it... but it has smudged and transferred onto my skin every time. I wanted so badly to love it as much as everyone else, but unfortunately it’s not great, or even ok, and is getting tossed.",1,2,B00T0C9XRK
"I bought this after I saw a product review online. I feel like I've looked for the perfect mascara my whole adult life, always disappointed in claims. I've bought cheap ones, expensive ones and all in between. When I saw how many high reviews were on this, I thought why not... The picture of the packaging looked like something a pre-teen would buy, but hey, I'll try it. WOW, I am SO not disappointed, and actually loving this! I have fine, thin lashes, and it usually takes at least 2 coats to make it look like I have lashes. This stuff, whatever it is, looks GREAT with just one coat! I think I FINALLY found my mascara! Now I feel like I need to buy a case load just in case they every stop making it.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Well. The only good things about this mascara: vegan + extra lasting (backhanded compliment, since its also pretty difficult to remove). The item was shrink-wrapped and appeared new, so no complaints there. Right out of the package it was extremely clumpy, however. It ends up being very messy during application. I personally had to do more than a bit of clean up on my *actual* eyelashes, versus the skins around it (the latter of which can be common with mascara application). Not worth it. Will either go back to Katy Kat or some other not-so-clumpy brand.",1,One,B00T0C9XRK
"This is my new favorite mascara. Recently, when I was traveling to see family, I lost my mascara. I went into a local Walgreen's and I was just going to buy the pink and green capped Maybelline that I know gives you instant volume. Although, I had used expensive mascara for years, I asked one of the workers if they could tell me where the Maybelline brands where. We started talking and I saw how beautiful her lashes were and asked her what she uses. She walked me over to Essense Lash Princesses and I bought it, think it is probably okay, but when I put it on, it is fantastic. So many people ask what I am wearing and I've recommended this brand to my vegan friends. Can't praise this mascara enough.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I was trying to find a non-animal testing alternative to L'Oreal (yes, they lie about doing animal testing) and had tried several big name brands but was disappointed with all of them. This one (Lash Princess) popped up as a recommendation and I liked what I read so I ordered it, and am so glad I did. It gives the length and volume as promised! As Promised! It has an easy to control wand that is the usual design with no odd curves or brush materials but with this formula, it just works. Plus, it's easy to remove. Some mascaras require rough treatment of your lashes to get them off (and they're not the waterproof formula) but this one doesn't. Oh, you'll like the handle too - the raised design is a non-slip rubber material so the handle is easy to hold.",5,One,B00T0C9XRK
"When I compare this mascara to my other favorites I notice that it performs about as well as all of them (they're all ""prestige"" brands @$30). Considering this costs ~$5 or less, it's easily at the top of my list for mascaras that I use and recommend.

It's really easy to work with once it's applied to lashes and doesn't clump up. I can remove excess before it dries and don't have to rush on that first coat when I fuss over the fine details. Some others I have used are just a clowny mess if you try to touch up once it's on your face.

We will see how well it works when 1/2 the tube is gone and it's starting to dry out a little. . .",5,2,B00T0C9XRK
"Omg just used this mascara for the first time and I cannot believe what my lashes look like! I have tried every mascara trying to make my thin straight lashes visible. Nothing worked so i stopped wearing it at all. Ordered this with no expectations but because it was so inexpensive figured I had nothing to lose. I now not only have visible lashes, I have long thick visible lashes and I cannot stop looking at myself in the mirror! I cannot believe this stuff. And it's cheap!! I would pay almost anything to have my lashes look like this. Over the moon happy Thank you, thank you, thank you Lash Princess! Going to order more right now!",5,3,B00T0C9XRK
"I have been using a $15 mascara for the past 5 years and the rep I have been purchasing from recently decided to get out of the business. Instead of finding another rep, I just decided to find a mascara that I could get quickly and easily anytime I needed it. I was skeptical about a less than $5 mascara but the reviews were so great I decided it was worth it to try it. I’m so glad I did because it’s a really great mascara!!! I already have long lashes but I love jet black mascara that lengthens and volumizes and this fits the bill and for a great price. Mascara is my one makeup item that I can’t live without and I HATE running out. So I will mostly likely buy these 3 at a time. Love it!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Best mascara I've used hands down. I paired it with the Essence lash primer and my eyelashes have never looked so good. It looks almost like false lashes that's how long they get. I would easily pay $10 for it. I have tried alot of different mascaras over the years and my favorite one was Maybelline Lashsensational. That one was the best I found till this Essence one. It really gives volume and lengthens more than any mascara I've seen. I will keep getting this one as long as the company keeps making it. I have showed 2 family members this one because when I find something that works so great I have to share the news. Try it,you won't regret it. If you like your lashes extra big like I do get the lash primer with it.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I have been searching for the perfect mascara since I can remember. Waterproof is too hard to remove but keeps my long, but pin straight lashes up. Others would weigh lashes down despite curling.

I saw great reviews on this and had to try it. Like all the others, it went straight into the trash after 2 days of trying.

It went on wonderfully, but later in the AM, it weighed down the lashes (even w/ only 1 coat) and by the end of the day, i looked like a raccoon.

The second day, I tried with extra lash curl and a few hrs later, lash is weighed down. I made sure to extra under eye powder, ant it still smudged. By the end of the night, I was back to raccoon eyes.",1,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I think that if the mascara brush shape were a different shape it would coat the lashes better. Also, there's quite a bit of fallout during application. Especially if you're one of the messes like me that sleeps in their makeup, In the morning there's a lot of fallout under the eyes. My only other problem is that it's a bit hard to remove. To be fair, I've always had this problem. All of this considered, it's a good mascara and I would recommend it!",4,One,B00T0C9XRK
"I love this mascara...I love a long, veryseperated, non-thick look. I was concerned this mascara would not achieve that, but the Ulta store manager insisted I try it and I’m glad I did. You an build it up if you want to achieve that thick, volume look but if you are Ike me, and like a more natural but still full and separated look this mascara is worth a try. My only complaint is that I don’t love the wand. I use a different wand from a different mascara. The wand is probably best for the thick, full on volume most people want though! I’m glad I was able to repurchase this mascara is on Prime!",5,One,B00T0C9XRK
"I'm very cheap when it comes to mascara. I have long lashes but they are fairly thin and translucent. The Neutrogena and Wet-n-Wild I got from the drug store for years were fine, but my curled lashes would always fall flat. Then I tried some Too Faced Better than Sex (from eBay) and IT Superhero (from QVC) and was underwhelmed for the amount I paid (both usually go for $20+ but cheap-o me paid around $12 for them). But the ""fancy"" formulas did keep my lashes more curled than the drug store brands. This is the PERFECT combination of a price below $10 and lashes that don't fall down! All the mascaras I've ever tried smudge a little and stick around after washing my face with just face wash (without using makeup remover specifically). This is no different. It's not a ""miracle"" product, but it does the best job at the best price out there! It lengthens and doesn't get too thick or clumpy. It's definitely a new favorite! You can wear it more naturally or build up layers for a thicker, glam look. I think it's great and I'll keep coming back for more!",5,One,B00T0C9XRK
"I wanted to love this mascara. But instead, I can't hate it enough. It flakes, runs, smudges, and burns my eyes. Unfortunately, I wore it to a new job orientation and was horrified when I looked at myself in the car mirror right before heading home. Oh. My. God. What a first impression I must have made to my new director and fellow workers - yikes! Major raccoon eyes - the stuff was smudged & flecked everywhere! My eyes felt an uncomfy burning/irritation, but I refrained from touching them. The first thing I did prior to the drive home was check the mirror to look for the cause: again, OMG! How embarrassing. It's DEFINITELY NOT smudge-proof or easy to remove. I used my go-to makeup wipes to no avail; needed to add coconut oil to remove. Truthfully, I don't like leaving bad reviews....but girllll, be warned!",1,0,B00T0C9XRK
I needed to replace my Too Faced mascara which at the time and even now showed as a top mascara. Then I saw this brand pop up in a search and thought I'd try it especially with the big price difference. I'm so glad I did as I'm never going back! This is the best mascara I've ever used and I've used many. I only use waterproof which limits me and this brand just exceeded my expectations. Goodbye Too Faced! My lashes have never looked longer or had more volume control until now.,5,2,B00T0C9XRK
"I didn't look at the picture of the wand before purchase. I opened the tube and thought right away I wouldn't like it. I'm not a fan of the brush type, they always seem to pull my eyelashes or stab my eyelids. However, I was very impressed with this mascara. The brush didn't pull my eyelashes. I didn't have any problem with clumping. I also have very sensitive eyes, but had no problems with itching, watery eyes, or causing stys. This is a great product, especially for the price!",5,2,B00T0C9XRK
"Okay, this may be my new go-to mascara FOREVER. First of all, it is so ridiculously cheap for how amazing it is. But even more important: check out the difference it makes!! I'm not wearing any mascara in the top photo, and I've done just one coat in the bottom one. This mascara adds great length and isn't too voluminous or clumpy. I'm always nervous about getting the tarantula-leg looking eyelashes, and this product doesn't do that at all. It's easily buildable to add a touch more volume, but still keeps the lashes separate and doesn't get too thick on the individual lashes. As someone with small hooded eyes, I never want my lashes to make my eyes look any heavier, and this product delivers. My eyes look bigger, more open, and more awake. A win all around!",5,One,B00T0C9XRK
"I absolutely love this mascara, but holy moly is it hard to get off! I have to let a makeup remover pad sit on my eye just to loosen it up. Initially I ordered the waterproof but it wouldn't budge and just smeared with eye makeup remover. I thought the non-waterprood would be better but only by a little.

I still use it though because the length and volume is amazing!",5,2,B00T0C9XRK
"I have used the Lancome Definicils (at about $27 a tube) for years...probably decades. I saw this on Amazon, saw the many reviews...read a LOT of them and figured, what is there to lose? It is cheaper even than Maybelline and Cover Girl, etc. I have used it for over a week and I don't think I will do Lancome anymore...As I have aged, my eyelashes have lost some volume and length so I don't expect miracles. For the price difference and not noticing any difference in the two, I will save my money and keep buying these. I sent one to my daughter who uses Diorshow but she hasn't gotten it yet. Will be interested in seeing if she likes this as well. For me, I just gave myself a raise. :-)",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I used to have LUSH long full eyelashes. But, as I got older, I lost the lushness, but kept the length. This mascara helped fill in the lost volume and evened out the overall shape. I am definitely glad I tried this brand. The only reason this did not earn a 5 star review is due to how many times it smudged later in the day. It wasn't horrible, but I had to keep checking my eyes for smudging once I noticed that it happened at all. Also, for a non waterproof version, it was harder than most brands to remove. I just purchased the waterproof version of this brand. I am hoping the waterproof version doesn't smudge. I am also hoping it's not even harder to remove than it's non waterproof version.",4,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I bought this after seeing some of the incredible pictures of people's eyelashes online. I have long eyelashes already but I like definition and don't care at all for mascaras that are ""soft"" I want these lashes coated dark and stuck ALL DAY! And that is what this does! It is definitely the best mascara I have ever used. It does clump your eyelashes together a bit so I keep an eyelash comb handy if that happens. But it you wipe the excess off the end of the wand it doesn't really happen. I will buy this for life! One comment though it does not come in any packaging and there just a piece of scotch tape sealing the top the tube.",5,3,B00T0C9XRK
"This is the best mascara ever! It doesn’t clump, (until old and dry,) and leaves my lashes looking full, long and healthy. As a lifelong user of Maybelline Great Lash and then Colossal Lash brands, I have switched to Essence Lash Princess False Lash Effects. And bonus-it’s less expensive! I change my mascara tubes every month or two, so this is a great advantage. I worried that the non-waterproof formulation would smudge easily, but so far, so good! It stays on all day and is fairly easy to remove with a good eye makeup remover and/or a wet washcloth. With the summer temperatures, that may change, but my waterproof mascaras would smudge in the heat, too.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"It's great! Gives a full effect. If you know how to work the brush it will give you the length you want. The brush is great, sturdy and definitely a great part of why it gives you the fake lash effect. It does pull a lot of the mascara out so be careful. A little goes a long way. It wont clump, or smudge.
For an everyday look: Brush lightly on the tips of the eyelash.
It looks wonderful!
For a dramatic look: definitely brush from the bottom of your lashes to the top.
Anyway, I'm sure you all know how to work your lashes.
I'm very pleased with this item.
Definitely recommend it.
Mostly, I didn't have allergic reaction to it. I'm 38 y/o and going through changes. I've recently become allergic to things I was not.
This product 👌 worked wonders.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"The search for the perfect budget mascara has been an ongoing challenge for me for literally decades now. I actually have pretty long and thick enough lashes, but they're super light and look invisible without mascara. And like many women, I would love a false eyelash quality mascara.

Pros: Definitely give the length and thickness and has a nice dark velvety color.
Cons: Can be a bit clumpy, definitely not waterproof for my contact lens wearer self, and can end up smudging.

It's decent for what I paid for it and among the better of the cheap mascaras. If I'm being honest, I prefer a mascara that looks good initially but isn't perfect like this one over some of the thinner mascaras that look barely there, which don't help my light lash eyes.",4,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Actually, I think I achieved this look before, with two different mascaras, a lash comb, and a spoolie. And the results were uneven. Anyway, I’ve tried a LOT of mascaras. Had two favorites, but they only did some of what this one does.

This formula is magic. Two coats of this, and I’ve got long, full, clump-free, curled up, super sexy lashes. Plus they’re even on both eyes (why is it so hard to get both eyes even?)
I keep looking at them. These are like movie star / fancy night out/ make up expert lashes.
(If we weren’t isolating, I’d have gotten so many compliments already. I just know it.)",5,One,B00T0C9XRK
"I am 68 years old and have been using makeup for 52 of those years. I have tried many mascaras over those years from inexpensive to very expensive. I cannot say that I have ever been really happy with the results. I had reached the point where I thought that, it does not matter the cost, they are pretty much all the same. This changed my mind. I put on two coats and it made my lashes look so thick. If I did not know better, I would think that I had on false eyelashes. I used baby shampoo, as I always do and I always lather with the baby shampoo twice, to remove the mascara, and it came off easily. I will look no more for a new mascara. I cannot imagine a mascara better than this.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I've used mascaras from CoverGirl, Loreal, NYX, Wet 'n Wild, Maybelline, Rimmel London, NYC, Too Faced, among others and none of them compare to this one. It truly makes my lashes look as if I had eyelash extensions because it makes them look so long and voluminous without making them look like hairy spiders (you know the ones). It does take some work to take it off at the end of the day, but to me that is a plus because it means my eyelashes stay looking amazing throughout the day. If you do more than one coat of mascara, you might see some smudging or a dark shadow appears along the lower lash line as the day goes on. Overall, I highly recommend it.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I've been using Thrive Causemetics mascara for awhile but decided to try this on the recommendation of a friend. Wow, for $5 you can't beat it! It goes on faster and with greater fullness in the very first coat, but removes much more easily. And the first day I wore it I cried buckets (separate issue, of course) but the mascara stayed put. I'd say it's at least 97% as good as the Thrive. I'm a believer now, and I won't go back to the more expensive stuff.

Update: It didn’t take long for the mascara to start clumping. So disappointing. Won’t purchase again. Sorry if I misled anyone",5,2,B00T0C9XRK
"I’ve used only Tarte Lights Camera Action mascara for about 4 years now and saw the good reviews for this and thought I’d give it a try. I thought if this works as well as people are saying and is just a fraction of the price of my usual, it would be worth it. Here’s the deal...it looks GREAT. Great length. Great volume. BUT and that’s a huge BUT, it rubs off. After wearing it for a few hours I have black overcast under my eyes and look like I haven’t slept in days. I do not rub my eyes and have not had this experience with many mascaras I’ve used in the past so idk what’s happening there. That’s my only caveat. Looks really good for the price so I’d say great budget mascara maybe if you don’t plan on wearing it all day? For me, it’s worth the extra $ to continue buying the Tarte LCA.",3,0,B00T0C9XRK
"My husband bought this for me after I put it on my wishlist. It’s beyond fabulous! I heard about this mascara from a blogger that I follow. Because of the price, I was a bit spectacle. However, this mascara will definitely be my new favorite!
One of my friends asked me yesterday if I’d gotten eyelash extensions! Yes! It’s that good!
I’ve read where some people wear it over their regular mascara, but all I need is one coat of this mascara and my lashes honestly looks like I’m wearing false eyelashes or have lash extensions.
Buy it! You won’t regret it, I promise!!",5,3,B00T0C9XRK
"It is the best mascara I ever used! It doesn't smudge (even if I take a pillow smashed into face nap). It doesn't flake. It gives a great volume and great length without any clumps (I don't let the first coat dry before applying the second).
Wonderful mascara and I also find the packaging to be super cute.
Unfortunately, such a wonderful product isn't for me. Never before, I've tried a natural mascara. It happens that I'm allergic to beeswax (the second ingredient here). I got red swollen patches under and over my eyes the second day I wore it in a row. I took anti-allergy pills, couldn't wear any eye makeup the next day, and wore this mascara again in a couple of days. It gave me the same allergic reaction but more intense.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I really like this mascara and I am going to continue to use it. It has cut in half the time that I used to spend coating my eyelashes with mascara. I only need one or two coats. One coat for work two to three coats for going out. However if you accidentally get it on your eyelid or around your eye it's not easy to clean off, when I wash my face it takes a few times to come off which is not a bad thing because it does stay on it is very good. It goes on pretty heavy so it's really easy to clump so you have to really make sure you get it right before it dries. I love this mascara and I have recommended it to everybody.",5,2,B00T0C9XRK
LOVE LOVE LOVE this mascara! I watched a makeup artist on Bailey sarian and she talked about how much she loves this mascara.. now let me tell you.. it is VERY hard to get me to try anything else other than Lancôme Monsieur Big (I’ve tried almost every kind out there in Sephora land!) for the price I though what the hell I’ll try it!? IN LOVE! And it’s less then half the price of my Lancôme ! I’M SOLD! You won’t regret it!,5,One,B00T0C9XRK
"I really like this mascara and you can’t beat it for the price! I added a photo of only one eye done to my review so you can see how well it lengthens the lashes versus the eye without it.

You do have to wipe off the excess at the end of the wand into the tube to prevent big clumps of the mascara. I also only brush through my lashes twice to prevent them getting clumpy.

It’s fairly easy to remove, maybe slightly more difficult than what I’d been using but not much. This doesn’t irritate my eyes either.

I like this mascara better than the drugstore brands I had been buying. I’ll definitely be using this now instead!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"🦋😚Works like a dream & cruelty free!! 🕺

I’ve bought a bunch of different expensive (IMO) drug store mascaras and I gotta say this is by far my favorite mascara!! It could be the low cost or the fact that it makes my stubby light brown lashes look pretty but I’m sold!!

👏$5!!👏
Free shipping
Look great on everyone!! Look at all these beautiful babes showing off their lashes in these (over 3k!!) happy reviewers!!

But hey! If ya don’t like it as much as all of us return it 😋 Amazon’s customer service is 👏so 👏good!

I’m so glad I found this gem! 💎 I’ve already turned a bunch of friends on to this mascara, I’m sure you’ll love it too!

"I am VERY impressed with this mascara, as it really does seem to elongate my eyelashes. And unlike some mascaras I've tried, I am not getting globs of mascara on the my lashes that look fake and cheap. Nor am I seeing flaking at all. I am truly impressed.

Caveat #1: I ONLY wear it on my upper lashes--it's not waterproof so I don't dare wear it on my lower lashes. Thus, I use a waterproof brand for the lowers. In spite of that, I love what it does for my upper lashes, and it stays on all day. No flaking whatsoever as someone else stated.

Caveat #2: I know there is concern about the fact that there is no seal or box. I agree about the concern, but so far, it's been great.",5,One,B00T0C9XRK
"I have tried a ton of mascara brands and types (Milk Kush mascara, Too Faced Better Than Sex mascara, and Tarte Lights, Camera, Lashes). This one is absolutely the best one I’ve ever tried. I was tired of never being fully happy with my mascara and tired of spending so much to try and find it. I gave this a shot after reading an article about it. I figured “it’s just $5 so what would be the harm in giving it a try?”. I am so happy I did. I’m spending WAY less and I’m getting great volume and coverage with no smudging or clumping. It easily comes off with eye makeup remover wipes and doesn’t run very bad if you’re out in the rain or need to cry out your bad day. The closest example I have for this is the Lights, Camera, Lashes by Tarte. It has the same smooth feel but looks better and makes my bank account happy. Give it a try. Worse case you’re only out $5. But hopefully you’ll love it as much as I do.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I love love this mascara,..the price is amazing,..it's not totally water resistant but if your eyes slightly run due to allergies or ya get a sniffle your not going to look like a raccoon. With that being said you may have to use just a lil extra effort to remove ,.not much tho.
It gives my lashes a thick long look I haven't had since I was a teenager,.( Mid forties here) and the best part,.it doesn't get that stuff crusty feel alot of mascaras can leave,..I love this so much that I'm buying them for friends, and the ones I've shared with so far love it too.",5,2,B00T0C9XRK
"I saw this product featured on a TV show. The price was so reasonable, I decided to try it.
The brush is great and application is easy. The product builds without clumping. It is not
as easy to wash off as others I have used. The blog drawbacks for me are this mascara
makes my eyes itch and begins to flake off by late afternoon. If you have sensitive
eyes, pass on this one. I’ll have to go back to more expensive option that doesn’t irritate.",3,One,B00T0C9XRK
"I found this on some facebook post. ""Must have things from Amazon"". The price was right and I gave it a try. It really adds volume. As with any other mascara that I purchase, I like it better when I use it for awhile. All of them seem to put too much on in the beginning and get better when it is like half gone. I know, that sounds weird. I would recommend it. When I purchased it the price was $4.99.",5,One,B00T0C9XRK
"Pros: Nice and dark black, gave some length to my stubby lashes, didn't flake off or smudge during the day., went on thick (in the good way)

Best of all - I have one eye that has lashes that curl up nicely and one whose lashes stick almost straight out (wtf, lashes, right?!) I haaaate those eyelash curlers so I normally apply mascara, then push the lashes up into a curl on my a$$hole eye, and hold them for a few seconds so the mascara dries and holds the curl. With this mascara I DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT!!! The bad lashes just curled on their own!!

Cons: Was a little clumpy but not a deal breaker and I'd buy again!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
I decided to try this mascara after seeing it highly recommended on an internet site. I was not disappointed and very happy with the results! It is actually much better than the big name brand $20 to $25 mascaras I normally purchase. I have seen a few say it is difficult to remove. I use petroleum jelly to remove eye makeup and this mascara comes right off easily. Not tried the waterproof version yet.,5,One,B00T0C9XRK
"After reading the positive reviews on this mascara, I could hardly wait to get mine. I had no problem applying the product and it gave me good volume. I didn't get much length from it but since I have long lashes, that wasn't an issue. My lashes looked great! However, after only a few hours, the mascara had smudged and flaked under my eyes. Then I had a terrible time removing it. I used 3 different removers and still had mascara residue on my lashes and around my eyes. I really wanted to love this product, especially considering the price and ease of ordering. But I threw it away without wearing it a second time. I didn't want to risk damaging my lashes and skin trying to remove it.",1,0,B00T0C9XRK
"On my constant quest for a mascara that works for me... I read a review for this mascara from a beauty magazine. I don't like to use eyelash curler out of fear of ripping my lashes out ;) I applied a few coats, no more than 2 I think. It worked as expected! Extended my lashes without making them look clumpy and gross. Highly recommend trying this mascara.",5,6,B00T0C9XRK
"It acts like waterproof mascara, it's really tough to get off even with oil-based waterproof remover. Also, it leaks onto your under eyes giving you the raccoon effect. I would consider this mascara unwearable. And it didn't do that much for my lashes in terms of volume or curl. Definitely worth a try for the price but I would not recommend it.",2,2,B00T0C9XRK
"Soo I never write reviews but this product really was amazing. I should emphasize that my lashes are HORRIBLE with curling, so I always have to curl them and use a waterproof mascara to keep them curled throughout the day and then generally add another non-waterproof mascara over the top to lengthen them a bit.
Therefore, the pictures I included are actually a combination of my normal waterproof mascara (covergirl lash blast-orange tube) with the lash princess mascara over the top. My covergirl mascara keeps my lashes curled but is not very additive (no matter how many layers, it does not provide additional length). I used the lash princess over the top and it added a ridiculous amount of length to them.
I will say, that the formula clumps my lashes a little bit but I kept combing through with the mascara applicator and used an eyelash brush once they were dry to help that (easy fix). It also is a denser/heavier formula so I do notice that my lashes don't maintain the same curl through the day (compared to what I am used to). HOWEVER, the length and volume I got from it, doesn't compare to any other mascara I have ever tried. If you have naturally curly lashes/lashes that curl without waterproof mascara, this one will probably do wonders for you by itself!",5,One,B00T0C9XRK
"This is the WORST!! OMG!! I had some real hope for this stuff, having heard that it was Da Bomb from some trusted YouTubers. I tried this stuff 4 times and it was exactly the same every time. Goes on super thick, clumps lashes together, zero lengthening, embarrassing spider lashes. There is no working with it, it just gets worse. It then flakes and chunks of crud fall off. What has occurred to me has been that said Tubers tend to wear false lashes as well as this stuff. That could make sense, as it is so thick and black. It works with the falsies. I, however, do not mess with the false lashes, so this mascara is a big NO for me.",1,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Personally, I can't believe anyone would gripe about this mascara, but who am I? (Retired professional pianist who's been wearing mascara since the age of 8 and now, 73...do the math).
I've had better results with this than products costing 6 times as much. This goes on very well and lasts all day. I wear a LOT of mascara and trust me, this does not cake while you're putting it on. If it does, it's because you don't know how to apply it. I do not like waterproof mascaras as they are difficult to remove. This comes right off with cold cream and a damp, warm cloth. It's a win, win for me. Just bought two more tubes.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I have used many types of mascaras trying to get thick, long lashes and most any mascara will do a decent job. This mascara goes above and beyond. It will definitely take your lashes to new heights and fullness. It does smudge for those of you who might be eye-rubbers, but for me it works pretty well. Definitely not water-proof so it washes off like a breeze. I wish it was water-resistant at least, but oh well, that won't stop me from using it. It definitely can clump a bit, but I use a separate mascara wand to thin it out a bit where it clumps. Love Love this mascara!",5,One,B00T0C9XRK
"This mascara has become the new MUST HAVE for my everyday make up. First of all, the price. How can you beat that!! 5$ for an amazing mascara is mind blowing really. I have used some of the higher end mascaras and this one is very comparable. It adds both volume and length. I have naturally long eye lashes already and this makes them just so full and gives it just the effect I look for in a mascara. Also, you can build it up. So I put one coat on for everyday and two or three coats on for a night out! it builds and gets even more full and longer. I haven't noticed any flakes or chunks like you sometimes get in cheaper mascara at all.
I will say the packaging could be better, they should really put it in a box or wrapped in some way because it just comes the mascara and its not sealed in any way. But you can tell it hasn't been used.
I cant wait to order again, and I have already recommended multiple times to all my family members and friends.",5,4,B00T0C9XRK
"I have had some major issues finding mascara that was good and also easy to remove and didn't smudge. This mascara has some impressive qualities, especially given how inexpensive it is. I went for a walk in the snow the first day I had it and expected that I must have mascara all over my face, and was shocked that it did not smudge or run one bit, even with snow in the face! Overall I am incredibly happy! If you rub your eyes it does smudge some, but I feel like that is fair. The effect is also impressive! One coat and it looks better than almost any mascara I have tried, including $30+ ones. Excellent! Incredibly happy!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Initially I wasn’t impressed but thought it was worth a try. I usually use benefit they’re real mascara and needed a more affordable alternative for the time being. I recommend scrapping all the excess mascara off of the brush before applying the mascara. Seems like a basic step but for me, there didn’t appear to be as much mascara on the brush.

The mascara itself dries quickly so be very efficient when applying. I have long lashes already and with a good application this definitely makes my lashes stand out more. The main differences with this mascara versus others is that it dries very quickly, can clump easily if not applied carefully and lashes look dry sometimes. Perhaps applying a primer on the lashes before use would help. This mascara is worth buying and will serve its purpose for the time being.",4,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I had never heard of this brand and it had good reviews, so naturally I was curious.

This mascara is buildable, has a great wand and while there was some transfer from my upper lashes to my lower, the formula goes on without clumps.

This is my first experience with a mascara that compliments my sparse lower lash line, giving the appearance of lengthened under eye lashes!",5,5,B00T0C9XRK
"One coat is all it took to achieve such long, separated lashes that left no clumps or buildup! Absolutely no smell from it at all! The mascara bottle is very nice, bigger than my usual size which means it will last a lot longer, with raised colored areas for added no slip grip and the tapered wand makes applying this mascara to not only your upper lashes but, also to find the tiniest of lashes, including the bottom lashes, easier to apply than ever. I usually always use an eyelash curler before I apply mascara but with this product, There is NO NEED! This has fast become my most favorite mascara to date, ever, and I WILL be a repeat buyer! I can't run out of this amazing find! :) Thank you!!",5,One,B00T0C9XRK
"Lash Princess false lash effect mascara did not turn out on my eyelashes anything like the ad photos. Of course, that's to be somewhat expected as those models had pretty good lashes to begin with and I'm a grandma with sparse lashes. The mascara works well enough to darken the lashes that are there, but I didn't see any extraordinary length added or any other dramatic results. Basically, right up there with most drug store mascaras. Maybe if it had a primer first?
As to some of the other reviews mentioning a lack of safety packaging - mine was well wrapped in a tight cellophane seal, so I don't know what to say. Mine was fine.",3,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I bought this mascara as part of Prime day, and since it was inexpensive and had good reviews I thought I would give it a try. I have thin, pale lashes for which I have been searching for a mascara for years without success! I have had this for about two hours and I have never had a mascara (from expensive to cheap) work this well. Eye on the left is with this mascara. Eye on the right has nothing. I absolutely LOVE this mascara. I look like I have eyelashes for a change!",5,One,B00T0C9XRK
"Reading the other reviews I thought this would be more allergy friendly. Hypoallergenic and smudge proof. While at the beginning my lashes were long and coated well (don’t over coat they get twiggy looking), they started smudging immediately. I didn’t even put it on my bottom lashes as they’re freakishly long on their own.

My eyes got red like I was high. I wiped the smudges off 3 times during the day. The picture above was right before I removed it for the day. I still have itchy eyes and a runny nose from this mascara the next day. This product is Terrible if you have makeup allergies. Save yourself the $5",1,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I'm not a huge fan of waterproof because even with face wash and an eye makeup remover they don't come off with one attempt. This mascara does not come off easily and wears like a waterproof mascara even though it's not advertised as such.

Overall I really like the product though so even though it's a pain to get off I'll buy again, especially at this price point.

Its definitely better than your average Covergirl mascara and it's less expensive.",4,2,B00T0C9XRK
"I seldom ever wear mascara because I hate the way it feels on my eyes. Plus, I have very, very thin eyelashes. Any other mascara I used, I'd always have to double or triple up on it but this product is amazing and (was) so inexpensive. It makes my lashes super soft, can't even tell I have it on and only have to use one coat. My co-workers asked if I had fake lashes on. However, I am extremely upset that since my first purchase (not even two weeks ago) the price of this product has exceeded more than 300%.",5,2,B00T0C9XRK
"I wanted to love this, especially after seeing and reading so many positive reviews.

However, my experience is pretty much the same as majority of the negative reviews read.

It clumps terribly, I have naturally long lashes and it made my lashes look like literal clumpy muddy sticks..

It wsa super flaky throughout the day and I looked like I had speckles all over my face from it just flaking. I also had racoon eyes within a short time of wearing it.

And for how much it flaked off and smudge throughout the day it was actually super difficult to take off and pulled out sooooo many of my eyelashes in the process. :(

There are definitely a lot of positive experiences which is awesome, but sadly this was a complete NO and loss for me. :(",1,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I used to use mascara that was $20USD a pop and yeah it was great but then Amazon stopped selling it. So I went to another brand that was $10 and that one was okay as well but wasn't cruelty free, so I searched for a new one and found this. I felt like the price was so low, that even if I didn't like it, I wouldn't be out a ton of money.

This is WAY better than the $20 and even the $10. It covers great and really does make my thin short lashes look longer. Highly recommend this, even if the price was $20, I'd recommend but as low as it is, I 100% recommend! Great product.",5,One,B00T0C9XRK
"Just buy it! If you're trying to give your lashes volume and length, this is it. I have thin medium length lashes and these definitely gave me the oomph I needed. Photo does not do the length justice. The key is to fan your eyelashes first (left to right with the brush a couple of times), then apply as usual thinly. Don't overuse or it'll look like spider legs. Not so good. ALSO, I tried it on my eyebrows and it worked! My eyebrows are now also a bit more full. This works better than those eyebrow pencil things that you see advertised a lot on social media. I now have my go-to dual eyelash and eyebrow solutions.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I like volume, but I really like my lashes to have an eyelash shape: thicker at the base, tapering to the tip, which rarely ever happens with volumizing mascara (I've tried highly-rated mascaras from department stores and drug stores), and while this doesn't give me straight-up spider eyes like a lot of popular mascaras since the volume craze started, they're still more blunt at the ends than I would like. It wasn't so bad that I was going to throw it away, but I was excited when I lost my tube and had to buy something else.

It lengthens and volumizes, but it's cakey. You'll probably like this if you're all-in with the volume bandwagon.",3,One,B00T0C9XRK
"I did not have high expectations for this, I mean really, a good mascara for less than $5, psht. I was wrong, I LOVE this mascara, I do two coats and go, wear it literally from 5am to 9pm 5-6 days a week. Some random times I will get a flake under my eye but I just brush it away and go. I have naturally curled eyelashes (sorry not sorry) and this adds the length that I like without costing $25 like my other favorite.",5,One,B00T0C9XRK
"Overall I am impressed with this mascara. I do use a primer most days, so it does have a lot of volume and length. However, it most definitely does -not- curl the lashes as was indicated in a beauty blog I read. I love curled lashes but I manage to pinch my eyelid on one side every time (and it hurts!) so when I read that this mascara “curls” the lashes, I had to try it. Length, yes. Volume, yes. Curling, no.
Disclosure: When I don’t use primer, I don’t see the length like I do with primer but still get the volume.
For the price point, I can’t think of a mascara that has worked as well as this. Will buy again.",5,2,B00T0C9XRK
"I bought the regular and waterproof and just applied the waterproof, it looks really, really nice and went on very smoothly, didn't even have to wipe the wand. Doesn't feel heavy or sticky and the brush works very well in terms of coverage. Got one for my daughter and she rated it a 5, and is picky about her mascaras. I can't say how will come off, as I haven't tried to remove it yet. Love that it's vegan/cruelty free. There is also a rubber bit around the applicator so it doesn't slip at all when applying. Love this stuff. I'm going to check to see if they make other products. Officially my favorite mascara!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I thought I’d give this a try just because it came up on my feed as something highly rated and worth purchasing, but I’m sad to say that this was a complete waste of money and time. It didn’t add volume so much as clump up my lashes entirely. And it was gummy in a way that made it difficult to completely remove when applied so I tried to comb out my eyelashes and do away with the clumps as best as possible, but then when it did dry it became totally flaky. So it was pretty much a waste of time, effort, and money. Zeros stars if I could... and I don’t think I’ve ever given a product a complete zero rating.",1,0,B00T0C9XRK
"So, I'm not a big makeup wearer but, I do try to play up my best features. I usually only wear eye liner and mascara. This mascara popped up in a FB Amazon deals group I follow and thought, ""hey, what the heck, I'll give it a shot for under $4."" Wow! glad I did. I do have pretty long lashes to start with and this mascara really highlighted them. I also have trouble with mascara getting all over my eye lids when I open my eyes back up after application and I end up with black dots on my lid. This dried really quick and I didn't have a problem with that which is a big plus!
This is my new go to mascara!!!!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"And Buzzfeed did its job right on this one— AWESOME mascara. I was getting Milk mascara before, but hello👀

I don’t usually wear makeup to work because it’s not exactly a job I can keep up my appearance every moment of the day, yet I’m still facing people pretty consistently. Therefor, I don’t want smudged mascara all over my face. But this stuff really stayed on throughout my shift! Lengthened and fanned my lashes out beautifully.
Also within ten minutes of being in the door two people complimented my eyes. So that’s worth something, right?! Hahaha.

So yes, between you, me, Buzzfeed, and like a million other people, this mascara is as good as advertised!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"This mascara is super badass for $4.99 Makes your lashes look stunning. The only thing, make sure that you scrape some product off the wand, otherwise it can get a wee bit thick and clumpy at the ends of the lashes right off the bat. It looks the absolute best if you start with a thinner layer and build if you want, rather than trying to apply a heavy layer in one shot. I have very sensitive eyes and lots of allergies and it doesn't bother me one bit. Pics are ONE quick coat after scraping the wand.",5,2,B00T0C9XRK
"I saw common complaints like not waterproof so it smudges, and it didn't go on smooth. I purchased L'Oreal's Voluminous Lash Primer to go underneath which is also only $5 on Amazon and together the combination is unreal. When I smile my eyelashes touch my eyebrows which has never happened before. It also keeps them nice and separated; they're not clumpy. I love that it even grabs the small lashes near in the inside corner. I had one mascara with fibers (that was like $30) that I loved before, but throughout the day the fibers would fall in my eyeballs and irritate the crap outta me, this DOES NOT do that. I've worked out, and it doesn't smudge, yet at the end of the day I do my normal facewash and it comes right off. This mascara lived up to the hype.",5,4,B00T0C9XRK
"This mascara is completely amazing. I can't believe how great and how cheap it is! I have sparse lashes that aren't very long. I also suffer from dry eye and my eyes are super sensitive. I haven't had a single issue with my eyes since I've been using this. Since my eye problems popped up years ago, I've never found a mascara that made my lashes look full & long without being irritating. I can't believe how long my lashes look when I use this mascara. My only (small) knock would be that it can leave those tiny little dark mascara balls at the tips of my lashes. I've always used clump crusher with every other mascara though, which helps eliminate that. If I used just this alone, I'd still be thrilled with it. It's very easy to remove... but I use a cleansing oil on my face so I don't know how easy it would be to do with just water.",5,One,B00T0C9XRK
"To start off this review, I'm one of the few lucky gals that has long and thick eyelashes, the only downside is that they're half blonde.
Anyways, I've been looking for mascara that was cruelty free, not breaking the bank, and not waterproof (I hate waterproof mascaras). The picture is with a couple coats of this mascara, versus my normal eyelashes, and WOW. I'm impressed. The brush separates, lengthens my eyelashes, and adds volume, exactly what it says.",5,One,B00T0C9XRK
"Holy grail mascara! I've used this mascara for about 3 years now and it still tops any other mascara I've tried. It will transfer if you apply it to your lower lashes, so I use a different mascara for my bottom lashes, which I don'tmind at all. I always get asked if I'm wearing falsies! It's a mascara that stays wet longer, so I always apply 1 coat, let it get tacky, then apply a second coat, for best results.

-Sister review",5,One,B00T0C9XRK
"I have tried high end and low end mascaras. I used to think a high end brand was the best but a friend told me to give this mascara a chance and OMG I will never ever use anything else. I have short light brown eyelashes, I use false eyelashes all the time but since I've been using this mascara it honestly looks like I've applied false ones. I don't know whats in this or how it does it but I promise you, you will not regret this purchase and wish you made it sooner.",5,One,B00T0C9XRK
"I was really impressed with the instant length and coverage. I love the component, there was a lot of thought put into the experience of interacting with the product and I appreciate that. The wand is just the right size, not enormous or overly spiky. I was really pleased with how the formula applied. It lengthened instantly, didn't clump despite being thick and has very solid coverage even though it's not a dense, clay-like texture. It managed to stay right in the sweet spot of the mascara texture/ lengthening/darkening paradigm. I did notice there was a ting bit of flaking immediately after application and I did have to do a little cleanup. It removed very readily with just a makeup wipe.",5,One,B00T0C9XRK
"I wanted to love this stuff since it had such great reviews so ai was really optimistic, but I ended up being really disappointed. It did a decent job lengthening and giving my lashes volume, but holly hell, do I look like a raccoon right now. I’ve only had it on for about 3 hours, ran some errands and just got home and looked at my face and I have black on my eyelids and under my eyes. I didn’t touch my eyes while being out since I’m really aware with COVID not to touch my face often while out in public, and it’s cold out so I wasn’t sweating, but I still have mascara everywhere. I really wanted to like this stuff, I’ll give it another try, and hopefully I will have better results.",3,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Heard a lot of good reviews about this and was really excited to try it, but it fell short for me. It literally falls throughout the day. My lashes look good at first, curled up, but by the time I get to work, they have fallen and look blah. It flakes off really bad too and I am constantly getting chunks of mascara in my eyes! I will not be continuing to use this product.",1,2,B00T0C9XRK
"I saw an article that said this was some of the best mascara and for the price I decided to give it a try. I usually use more expensive mascara so that’s what I was judging it against which might not be fair but if it caused some people to switch over then might as well see what the hype is about. It definitely does what it says. My lashes definitely looked longer and had more volume. The one thing that bothered me was that it was super clumpy. I had to try and brush out the clumps but it only made it slightly better, it also dries super quick (again might be a plus for some people) but it made it harder to fix all the clumps. When I tried brushing through parts would become flakey and just come off so I lost length. If you’re looking for a cheap mascara that’s going to add length and volume then this is definitely for you. But I can’t get over clumps and having to work harder to make it the right way.",4,0,B00T0C9XRK
"The eye lash gods have answered all our prayers. YOU MUST PURCHASE this mascara. I was so skeptical. Even after reading all the reviews I was highly doubtful that a $4 mascara could be that good. Well let me tell you...it works 10x better than higher end/more expensive brands. So many people have asked me if I'm wearing falsies or lash extensions, and I wear glasses. It's smudge proof and does not flake. I have fallen asleep with it on (I know, I know, don't yell at me) and I didn't have flakes, smudges or smears anywhere around my eyes when I woke up. Although it has staying power it's easy enough to remove with a makeup wipe...I don't have to scrub my eyes. It's also very black, which I love, doesn't clump, adds volume and length to your lashes. What are you waiting for? Buy it now!!!!!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"As an avid consumer of cheap mascara, I was annoyed when the formula for the brand I usually buy in the store went south and would go crumbly basically out of the package (*cough*L’OREAL*cough*). I knew I needed to try something else but I hate change because there are so many options and I’m also picky—it needs to be long-lasting yet easy to remove, have a soft brush, easy to apply, etc. This brand was the first I tried, I have been using it for a couple weeks now, and I really love it. I feel like you get a lot of product in the bottle for the price. I was initially concerned because the applicator brush is more narrow and not as soft as I would like, but the more I use it the more I prefer it because I feel like I am able to be more precise when applying. I usually do two coats because I have thin lashes. The first coat goes on really smooth, and I do get a bit of clumping with the second, but it’s not unreasonable and probably wouldn’t happen if I allowed the first more time to dry (but I’m impatient). I get great volume and length, and it lasts all day yet comes off easily when I want it to. I also really love the extra grippy details on the handle! Don’t change anything and you’ll have me as a customer for life. :)",5,One,B00T0C9XRK
"This product is pretty awesome. The brush takes getting used to but any mascara brush does. It clumps easily and creates spider eyelashes, that’s what I call them. Thick and almost clumpy. I know some people actually like that look but I don’t. High quality false lashes don’t look like that. I’m careful how I work the brush so I still get a long, thick lash look. But I’m not sure other brands can’t produce the same thing. Still, good for the price though.",4,One,B00T0C9XRK
"I bought this on a whim based on great reviews. My very first impression was:
1. I hate the brush. It's too stiff so it kind of feels like I'm brushing my lashes. If you didn't remove the previous day's makeup completely, you'll feel it.
2. The bristles don't seem long enough, so I felt like my lashes were sometimes clumping together.

I was ready to trash it. To be fair, I put on Urban Decay's $25 Perversion Mascara on my other eye. It is all the things this isn't. BUT - the results look THE SAME.

I WAS SHOCKED. I am going to be saving so much money in the future! My only advice is to get an eyelash brush for those rare instances when the brush has too much goop and you get your lashes are gloopy-gooped together.",4,0,B00T0C9XRK
"When people say that it looks like false lashes it looks like false lashes. Here I have a picture of one eye with it and one eye without. It's really a nice product that doesn't bother my sensitive eyes at all, it is a little difficult to get off I have to use an oil product every time. But that's okay because then it means it's not smudging off or running during the day",5,One,B00T0C9XRK
"So I just had to buy this mascara and I have to say, I'm thoroughly impressed. I've only used it twice but it's definitely great value product, with SO many mascaras on the market. Like many reviewers I've used Christian Dior, Bobbi Brown, Benefit, L'Oreal, Make Up Forever (my favorite cone shaped wand) and after awhile they all seem similar in formula. It's the wand that makes the difference for me. That said, this mascara is your basic formula (washable) and a nice wand/packaging. I had to see what all the hype was about and I'm impressed. I will be buying it again in the future.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I honestly don’t know why this mascara is on so many beauty/Buzzfeed “must have, miracle product” lists. It’s not great at all, and Essence has a whole line of mascaras that ALL exceed this one! This clumps terribly, sticks lashes together, adds thickness but in a haphazard way — does not volumize, extend, or hold a curl. Definitely doesn’t separate lashes well at all. I have naturally longer lashes and this just made them look spidery and odd. I should have veered away when I saw others’ photos, but I figured it might be different on different people. It’s...not. Even with a primer (which honestly just made things worse).

If you see the photos and this is the look you’re going for, then right on! If you want lush, long, volumized and separated lashes, then there are FAR better Essence mascaras at the same price (or less - at Ulta I got a curl & volume for $3.99, didn’t check Amazon price though. It outperforms literally every other mascara I’ve tried in the past 2yrs! Red tube, look for it! The primer too, I wasn’t really into primers but for the price I tried it and BAM - puts the curl/volume mascara into overdrive!)

But as for this Lash Princess...just not my cup of tea. Maybe it’s yours, but definitely check the photos first.",2,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Best mascara I've ever used. I used to use Hard Candy mascara but they stopped selling it in stores. I was looking for it on Amazon, but then came across this one and decided to give it a try. I've never loved a mascara more than hard candy until this one. I have very thin eye lashes and this makes me look like I have falsies in. It doesn't clump my lashes together either. 10000/10 would recommend. You can even put on several layers without it looking clumpy or unnatural.",5,One,B00T0C9XRK
"You can’t beat the price! And this product really does extend the length of your lashes as well as, if not better, than big brands like Younique. I have allergies and one thing I am allergic to is beeswax. Younique mascara contains that. I like this product does not and is cruelty-free. I will say the only negative is it is hard to remove. You have to have a type of makeup remover to get it totally off your eyes-or from under your eyes the next day. Washing your face alone will not remove it. I highly recommend it. I got it because it was featured on the Today show December 2020.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I’ve tried drug store brands, and higher end am I really paying this much for mascara brands. This, this is the ticket! My advice is to definitely layer so you don’t get spider lashes. I do one light coat, move onto blush...another light coat...move on to lips...and then a final light coat. I’m very impressed, no flaking, no raccoon eyes, yet easily removed at the end of the day....whenever that may be lol!",5,3,B00T0C9XRK
"This mascara is pretty amazing, especially for the price. It isn't extremely voluminous, but it makes your lashes look super long and beautiful. It doesn't clump up, but separates each lash. I was at Ulta the other day looking at eyeliner, and a lady came up and asked me which mascara I was using. I even had my glasses on and she still noticed them! I am pretty blown away and will be buying this from now on.",5,One,B00T0C9XRK
"I have tried all kinds of mascaras both expensive and cheap. This one is AMAZING! My lashes come alive and are actually noticable without looking clumpy and fake. The waterproof is my fav as it stays on ALL day even on my bottom lashes without running. I have to use an oil based eye makeup remover to get it off...but that just means it is good!

Stop looking elsewhere and give this a try...you won't be disappointed!",5,One,B00T0C9XRK
"I am extremely surprised at how awesome this mascara is! I typically have very sensitive eyes to all sorts of brands of make up. I usually use Marykay, but decided to give this a shot since it was only $4.99. I am immensely impressed! I highly recommend it. It gives that nice bit of volume, it’s not too clumpy, it comes off easy enough with my regular make up remover, and it holds on pretty strong even if I rub my eyes a little. I can even be lazy, sleep in it, and reapply some more the next day if I want and it still looks good! You should get one !",5,One,B00T0C9XRK
"The minute I opened the box and saw the mascara, I KNEW it was going to be awesome. On the wand at the top, where you hold it, there are raised letters for an amazing grip! I've NEVER seen this on other mascaras and I have tried tons of them - from Clinique to Maybelline! I have a mild case of tardive dyskinesia in my hands, so applying mascara is tricky sometimes. So I LOVE the wand, but how would the actual mascara be??? AWESOME as well! I couldn't believe my luck, because it went on easily and gave my lashes definition and length! Seriously, buy this mascara and see for yourself! (I'm ordering a couple more now, before the world gets wind of this product.)",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I’ve been a die hard “Better than sex” mascara fan for the last few years but I bought this because I was bored and quarantine shopping, but it’s really fantastic. Much cheaper than the other mascara and I loved the way my lashes looked. I was surprised because the brush is so thin and not-fluffy that I didn’t think it would work for me but it’s Great. My lashes look long, but not thin. I’m really happy with this random buy.",5,One,B00T0C9XRK
"I decided to try this product from a Amazon Gift Ideas article I read about. For $4.99, why not? I was thoroughly impressed by what I received. The mascara applicator is ideal for application. Not too wide, not too thick, not too thin. Just perfect! I have tried using like mascaras in the past, but experienced lots of ""flaking"" of the fibers throughout the day. Not utilizing this mascara! I experienced a all day wear without the smudging or flaking. I will definitely be reordering this product!",5,One,B00T0C9XRK
"I tried fake lashes and hated them! Then I saw this and bought it immediately. It definitely makes a difference compared to regular mascara. The lash effect was easy to remove but I haven’t tried the waterproof version. I also noticed a more plumper lash after using this compared to my previous mascara. I don’t think it will give you a crazy huge lash effect with tons and tons of length and volume, but honestly does any mascara do exactly what fake lashes do? No. But this is the next best thing to using fake lashes and it’s way easier and way more comfortable!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"This mascara is only $5 and it can lengthen your lashes like I've never seen. Unfortunately, it leaves raccoon eyes within a couple of hours. I've tried applying tube mascara under or over it and it still doesn't help. Long story short - it's amazing if you can check, wipe, redo your under eye every hour or so. Also have tried essence Bye bye Panda eyes and it definitely isn't a tub mascara and doesn't pack the punch that this mascara does. I am hoping they will fix their formula because I would love to wear this mascara daily if I didn't have to check on it all the time.",4,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Found this back in 2017 at a Forever 21 mega store. Been using it ever since. For a while it was hard to find, so happy there is now a prime option on Amazon. This stuff is amazing, looks great, doesn’t smudge (maybe a little if I am sweating or touch my eyes) and the tube lasts a while before drying out. I’ve tried other brands but always find myself back to this one.",5,One,B00T0C9XRK
"Excellent volume, curl, and stark black color! My eye lashes look soo pretty with Lash Princess False Effect!

Initially this mascara did give me raccoon eyes, but all of the expensive name brands do too (looking at you WATER PROOF (?!?!) Better Than Sex 🙄😡). However, I started using a translucent powder under my eyes to soak up my oils, the Lancôme Cils Booster XL as an eyelash primer, this mascara and a setting spray—no more raccoon eyes. 9 hours of wearing a mask, sweating, and constant movement in a hot bakery and my eyes still look fresh! Honestly, if raccoon eyes isn’t a big problem for you, this mascara will probably be perfect. If raccoon eyes are an issue for you and expensive mascaras still don’t help, try a powder/primer/mascara/setting spray combo.

Also, I use Cetaphil cleanser at night and this mascara comes off without any issue. ✌🏻",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
I've tried other mascaras that claim to extend your lashes comparable to false eyelashes. None lived up to the hype in my opinion. I saw this on the Today Show demonstrated on a model and decided to try it. For $4.99 it couldn't hurt. It is WONDERFUL. My eyelashes are very skimpy but I wear glasses so for me extensions are not worth it. This mascara lengthens and adds volume without clumping. I immediately ordered more!,5,One,B00T0C9XRK
"I love this mascara!! My sister (aka makeup queen) told me about it while I was out shopping for one. I looked it up, saw all the great reviews, and decided to order it. I got it the following day, and WOW! Best mascara I've used so far. I've bought several expensive mascaras in the past, and so far this ones tops most of them. It glides on smoothly, and the black is actually black. Not like others where you have to layer it on, so you see that it's black. It's actually black, and makes your eyes pop almost immediately. So far, so good. Price and all! I'll definitely be ordering again!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Disappointing. I love love love mascara and am always looking for the next best thing (between my makeup sample subscriptions and shopping habits I try out a new mascara almost weekly). I was excited to give this a try based on the reviews, and man, this stuff is no bueno! It was super cheap (which should have been my first red flag), and you do get what you pay for with this. This is the type of product I would expect to find in a dollar store (which I do not shop at for mascara!). When swiping across lashes, it barely puts any product on your lashes, consistency is thin and almost gel like- it hardens quick and is not buildable. I tried several coats to try to build it up and it just created a clumpy mess on my lashes that took me forever to try to separate. Also, it was not easy to wipe off of my eye lids after making quite a mess trying to make this work. Those that have hyped this up either already have great, volumized lashes that all they need is a tint of color on, or they must not have ever been introduced to quality mascara product.",2,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I have spent the bank on mascara. Age has robbed me of my long, thick lashes. I read the reviews for this product and decided for the price of a small cup of plain coffee I could try one more mascara that promised to leave me with to die for long and lush lashes.

I did not expect to LOVE this product. BUT, I do.

The color is bold but not fake. It does NOT create a spider leg effect. I HATE that look. This mascara creates a classic thickened lash line while adding depth and extending each lash.

Removing this product is easy using an Equate brand make-up remover wipe.

Silly, I know, but I love the comfort twist lid. Because it offers textured print on the lid, I can hold the wand firmly while applying. It’s the little things.

Some smudging has occurred, but I have had less smudging with this product than I’ve had with $30 tubes of mascara.

I took the money I saved taking a chance on this $5 mascara and purchased myself some fancy coffee. I took a selfie to admire my lashes. :)",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I had black smudges under my eyes after only a couple of hours of wear! I put it on around lunch time, worked at my computer for a short time, then checked out how the new mascara was holding up. Raccoon eyes! I gave it a try for a few days and every single time I had problems with dark circles shortly after. Really disappointed considering how many positive reviews this product has. As far as application, it's fine. Length and volume was pretty good. But what's the point if it all transfers to under my eyes so quickly? Overall, would not recommend.",2,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Awesome mascara for every day use, this goes on really well without clumps or smudges. Just one coat makes a huge difference in opening up the eye - see attached photo. I only put the mascara on one side so the lighting and angle would be exactly the same to show the comparison. I’m sure my lashes would get much longer and darker with a second coat but for every day use I felt that would be too much. I’m a huge fan of this super affordable mascara! It matches, if not beats, the fancy high-end mascaras on the market for which you’d pay $20-$30 or more.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Let me start by saying that I have tried many, many mascaras and this one is my absolute fave. Even my sister, who often mixes several mascaras to get her desired look, loves this. It really does give you the impression of false lashes and I've read many reviews from beauty editors who also love it. However, you will not love it at first. The first few times you use it (3-5), it's liquidy and messy (apply before eyeshadow!) and you won't love it. However, if you can stick it out past the first few uses, this will become your new favorite mascara. Trust me.",5,One,B00T0C9XRK
"I opened up my high-end department store mascara the other day to discover it was completely dried out (that's how often I wore it). So I got onto Amazon to search for a replacement that I didn't have to spend a large amount of money on, giving how often I used my other. I saw this and the reviews and thought ""ehh.. why not, it's only $5?!"" I had never heard of this brand or used it before. The first time I put it on, I was in complete shock! My lashes were literally rubbing against my sunglasses! My coworkers actually thought I had false lashes on because they looked so full and long. I was asked numerous times by numerous people what mascara was responsible for this sorcery and personally witnessed 3 girls purchase it ON THE SPOT as soon as I sent them the link for the product. This item is a gem and for those of you wondering if it's worth it, it absolutely is! Just a tip though to allow adequate time to dry completely between layers, as it seems to dry slower than others I have used.. but aside from that it's pure gold. I bought some for a friend but feel like I should've stocked up on more because once word gets out of how good this stuff is, I have a feeling it will be difficult to get. The only downside I can think of, which isn't a reflection on the product itself, is that it takes like 3-4 days to get product instead of the 1-2 day shipping unless associated with a $25 Amazon order. But again, that has nothing to do with the product itself and everything to do with my lack of patience.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Love love love!!!!!! Been looking for years for a good mascara that made my lashes look fuller without being clumping. Looks like I get false lashes out on but also natural! No clumps, easy to remove at night, and omg so cheap! I hate going to drug stores and spending $12 for clumpy mascara with a horrible brush. The brush on this application is perfect!!! Evenly spread the mascara as well as separating my lashes doesn’t smoosh lashes together then have to separate them. Easy to use and can layer for more fullness look without it looking like I have ten layers of mascara on.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"This mascara looks great and it makes my lashes longer and thicker. HOWEVER, after a few hours of wearing black smudges develop under my eye. My eyes actually hurt, not burn, not sting just ache and hurt while wearing this. When I take off the mascara it actually does not all come off. I've tried makeup remover and dove soap. These pictures are 4 DAYS AFTER I wore the mascara. It won't wash all the way off. There is always some left on for a few days under my eyes on my skin. It's very strange. I've never worn mascara like this before.",2,0,B00T0C9XRK
"This stuff is amazing! You can layer it on for longer lashes, but be sure to have a lash comb handy to get rid of the clumps. It goes on smooth and easy. This is the best mascara that I have used in all of my 36 years, amd that includes my Benefit cosmetics roller lash mascara... while Benefit was good, this is better and the price is unbelievable. I had no problem curling them with my lash curler after I applied the mascara, but I already have lashes that naturally curl up some on their own, so I can't speak for those with straigh lashes. I was able to remove it easily with Neutrogena make up remover wipes in the blue bag. I usually have a problem with smudging and ""raccoon eyes"" due to living in the south, but I haven't had any issues so far with this brand. Keep in mind that it is only November tho. Overall, I would definitely purchase again, and I would definitely recommend this product to friends. Another terrific plus is the price! I paid almost $20 for a travel size of Benefit mascara and this one was only $5 for a full size large bottle. I will continue to purchase this for as long as possible. LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!! 💘 💗
*I should also note that I am half Portuguese and have had naturally thick and dark lashes most of my life until my early thirties when they started thinning a bit, but they are now about average length and thickness without any makeup. This should work well for just about anyone. Thanks 😊.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I am so surprised this inexpensive mascara provided smooth coverage for buildable volume and length! I did not have any issues with smudging. The wand is comfortable to hold. The brush is not huge and is just the right density to capture each lash. I've read that the tube dries out quickly, but that remains to be seen. When this happens to me, I usually add a few drops of moisturizing eye drops to extend the life of the product. My default mascara is Chanel LeVolume, so liking this essence Lash Princess is quite a surprise for me!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I have a love hate relationship with this mascara. I love the clean long look of my lashes, it's very natural and not clumpy. However, I swear this stuff never dries. Half way through my day and I have black smears below my brow where my eyelashes touch my skin. I wipe them away with my finger, I look again at the end of the day and the dang marks are there again! It's not like I'm rubbing my eyes or anything. It just doesn't seem to ever dry, it's weird! Love the long lashes it gives me though, just gotta remember to wipe your eyelids clean every two hours.",3,One,B00T0C9XRK
"So this mascara really does lengthen quite a bit! I agree with the glowing reviews about it lengthening better than many high end brands. The only issue is that it does tend to smudge on me. After a few hours of wear I am noticing a “raccoon eye” effect. I’m going to try sealing over it with my high end mascara to see if that may help. I love the length it gives me, just wish it would stay put!",3,One,B00T0C9XRK
"My lashes grow straight and down. I thought that this mascara was supposed to be magical like the L'Oreal lash paradise, or Benefit's roller lash, but for me it's a dud. It's so watery, like the consistency of a Wet n Wild mascara, and it slips and slides all over the place. it doesn't help to curl or hold a curl no matter how much heat, or lash primer I use, and there is zero ""volume enhancing"" happening. Once I put it on, I have maybe an hour before it starts to flake and smudge, and I don't have watery eyes. Also, it kind of burned my eyes, but not to the point of concern, just during application. Spend two or three extra dollars for a CoverGirl lash blast, or a Maybelline lash sensational, and don't waste your money on this.",2,0,B00T0C9XRK
"This is incredible mascara, but I am deducting one star because it isn’t offered in dark brown. Otherwise, it’s perfect! Goes on easily, doesn’t cake, smudge or wear off. Several layers and it will look like false eyelashes. I have sensitive eyes and most mascaras bother me but this one doesn’t. It removes easily with makeup remover, and I love the fact it’s cruelty-free. So please, PLEASE offer it in dark brown!!!!",4,One,B00T0C9XRK
"As someone who loves makeup and wears it daily, this mascara is my favorite.

I have tried countless different types of mascaras and brands and I have finally found my true love, this one. I recommend this one to everyone I meet. This mascara works better than more expensive brands, and yet they charge so little for it. It works well in adding length, volume, and if you curl your lashes then it helps keep the curl.

People are constantly asking me if my lashes are real, to which I say that they are, because I never wear falsies, I just wear this mascara. It does flake a little, but it’s not bad. I am a contact lens wearer and I’ve never had an issue with it. It isn’t the easiest to remove, so make sure you have some makeup remover rather than just using plain water.

NOTE: This mascara does NOT have any fancy packaging. It just comes in a plain plastic Ziploc type baggie or plastic cling wrap with a sticker on the outside. I don’t mind this and I’ve never had any sort of infection from this, but this may not be the mascara for you if you’re worried about this.",5,One,B00T0C9XRK
"I saw this on a few Buzzfeed shopping articles and had to try it! The mascara works well! It does add length. My only thing is Im a blond with blue eyes, so I normally wear brown/black mascara. Essence only has blackest black option, which I didnt realize how different it actually looks till I put it on. I wish they offered that as an option. :) Otherwise its just too dark on my face, which is why I why dont wear it as often as I would have and not sure if Ill re-order. My mom liked It so much she had me order 3 for her though haha. Overall Great mascara, especially for the price. Stays on all day and doesn't crumble like some, but as a result takes a little more than just water and even soap sometimes to get it off.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"This mascara was covered on the Today Show and I was curious but skeptical because the price is quite low - but they were right! This mascara works great, increasing the volume of my lashes much better than any other mascara I've used. I love that it's cruelty free, and the price point is amazing - cheaper than Covergirl, Physicians Formula and other cruelty free brands. It comes off with makeup remover and a shower, mostly, but I still get a bit of a dark circle under my eyes. Not badly though, and it's worth the tradeoff as it really does make my lashes look better!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"UPDATE - Both tubes of this mascara are so clumpy. I wipe with a tissue before applying and it still clumps and makes me look ridiculous. I won't buy it again. Two stars for being cruelty-free.

I purchased two of these and the first one I tried was incredible clumpy. I looked ridiculous. I wiped the excess off the wand and it still clumped. Because this mascara gets such great reviews, I thought maybe I got a defective one. I tried the second tube and it's working great so far. I appreciate that it's vegan and cruelty-free and a great price!",2,One,B00T0C9XRK
"This mascara really gives great definition and length to my light colored lashes. It stays on really well and doesn't smudged easily. It is much harder to remove. I've always used baby shampoo in the shower to remove my mascara, an old holdover from when I wore contacts. Now I use a makeup remover that is rated for mascara as well and then use the baby shampoo to get all of the mascara off. I guess that's the price you pay for the great definition/length and the non-smudge. Oh....can't forget to mention the great price!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"As someone who never thought twice about dropping 30 bucks on a mascara and has owned pretty much every popular prestige brand mascara on the market, I can say with confidence, this is just as good, if not better. Two coats gives you a tremendous amount of length and volume. It’s better than Better Than Sex, Roller Lash, They’re Real, Perversion. The brush is a little long but easy enough to work with. With something like this on the market, I wouldn’t consider buying an expensive mascara ever again. Highly recommend. Do not let the price fool you.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
This came in an envelope with no packaging for the mascara. It had 2 stickers that were supposed to make it look like it hadn't been opened but they were stuck to each other and not on the bottle. It seems very risky to put this on my eyes.,1,13,B00T0C9XRK
"This mascara is great- totally gives lashes lots of volume and it is simple to take off. HOWEVER, it is terrible with “shedding” and leaving little black specks all over your face near your eyes. I even used a primer and it didn’t help. The volume is great but also not worth ruining my entire face of makeup over or getting little marks on my face. Raccoon eyes are real issue too and I don’t even use mascara on my lower lid. The idea is there for sure and it does work in some ways- not enough for me to keep buying I though!",3,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Mascara is a very personal choice, lol. I gave this a try instead of my Lash Paradise because of the reviews and the price. For the price, it's fine. I'd still rather try another formula from the same brand, because while it does make my lashes a little longer looking, it doesn't do a thing for volume, for me. I prefer fatty lashes. My lashes look nice when I'm not wearing any other eye makeup, but it's just not dramatic enough otherwise. I also noticed flaking, and it smears under my eyes a lot easier than other kinds. But once again, for the price, it's fine, and I'll keep using it when I'm not wearing any other eye makeup. I did just buy another formula from essence to see if it's the brand, or just this particular product.",3,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I purchased once and loved the results until I got two styles. I didn’t realize the connection until I developed pink eye a week later. I had not been around anyone with pink eye. Dr suspected it could be the mascara after ruling out contact with anyone with pink eye.
The wand was not tightly screwed to the tube when I got it and there is no factory safety seal.
Looks good, but not worth contaminating your eyes. I’d rather invest in a clean product than spend money for urgent care copay and cost of medication in addition to a day lost from work.",1,One,B00T0C9XRK
"So many rave reviews but it did not do it for me! Idk, it was okay if I want the most natural looking eyelashes... i.e. no volume or length. For instance, I think this product is great for anyone who has super light eyelashes(blondes/redheads) and just wants their eyelashes to pop.. but this did not give me length and it did not give me volume. And it is very easy to remove as it flaked off but once on my face, it is certainly smudge-proof.... I like a bit of length and extra volume for my mascara and the Bambi mascara does that for me.",3,0,B00T0C9XRK
"It really does magic for the length of your lashes for sure but for me I was not smudge proof. I also found it very hard to remove completely both from the skin around my eyes and the lashes themselves. I don’t wear mascara daily and the times I do I use an oil cleanser, micellar and cleanse but that isn’t enough for this. The following day/days the mascara I thought I removed is evident from my Ozzy Osborn under eye. That was frustrating because again it had no problem shedding and running under my eyes throughout the day or after I thought it had been removed.",3,0,B00T0C9XRK
"After using this about a week, I have to update my review. Maybe air getting to the mascara causes it be more clumpy on lashes. Won’t buy this again as I don’t have this problem with my other mascara.

I usually wear waterproof mascara because all non-waterproof mascaras smudge, flake, and run easily. This one stayed on all day without smudging or flaking at all. Love the packaging of this product with the easy grip top. It does clump if mascara is not allowed to dry between coats, but otherwise I’m happy with this mascara.",3,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I stumbled on this low priced mascara and am ordering again today! I purchased 3 different brands this year, all at least $20 and none of them looked as definitive as this mascara does. I have sparse lashes that just began growing again in the last year. When I applied this as test I was shocked at how easily I can now see my actual lashes. No more false lashes for me. Easy on, stayed on and easy off. I love this mascara and will make sure I never run out. I hope they don't change the formula!!!!!!!",5,One,B00T0C9XRK
"I fell in love with Younique MoodStruct 4D mascara- but at $30+ a pop and having to order it ahead of time...I searched for an alternative. THIS MASCARA IS IT! Super plush, defining, lengthening, thickening...AWESOME mascara all the way around! I've even recommended it to friends who love it now as much as I do. And you absolutely can't beat the price...cheaper than drugstore mascara! I struck gold with this mascara and I will be a loyal customer forever.",5,One,B00T0C9XRK
I gave this mascara two stars instead of one only because it did make my lashes look fuller. The problem is I would end up having mascara smeared under my eyes after I had been at work for a few hours. Also I cannot get the mascara off easily even with make up remover. I truly do not understand the hype over this mascara.,2,One,B00T0C9XRK
"LOVE THIS!

my eye lashes look so long, full and are not all caked & stuck together. The best $5 investment I’ve purchased in awhile.

I’m really picky about my mascara, I can’t stand when they look clumpy or flakey and I hate when they look thin and have no volume.

I wanted my lashes to look full, bold and long without sacrificing for cakey flakey volumeless lashes, this gave me exactly what I wanted!

You only need a little, make sure to wipe the excess mascara on the inside of the bottle before applying because I didn’t at first and I had black mascara splashes all over the top of my eyelids 😂 aside from that I love it. It stays on all day, but it takes no effort to remove with a single makeup wipe.

The reviews were really good as well as the price, you can’t even get decent drug store mascara for $5. that’s what lead me to try it, I’m so pleased I took the chance! It’s comparable to “better than sex” mascara, I actually like it more.

I can’t wait to try the other versions of this brand! Very pleased!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Does not flake! Does not smear!
Wore this throughout my vacation, in the water, while working out, to sleep, etc. and it stayed on beautifully!
My lashes are long but they tend to fall quickly ... They'll be perfectly curled for about 5 minutes then down they go. With this mascara they seemed to hold at least a little curl much better and for much longer than with most other mascaras.
It does seems to ""clump"" several lashes together sometimes so I have to separate those with a lash tool but aside from that this is a great product!",5,One,B00T0C9XRK
"Personally, I love this mascara. I have short lashes which have thinned out over the years. Essence only needs one coat and it makes my lashes look full and longer. As a retired cosmetics manager, I always advised my clients not to continually re dip the mascara wand into the mascara. A quality mascara should work on both eyes without re dipping. This ones does that, I just keep stroking it on my lashes slowly and carefully. I purchased three on Amazon because I do not want to run out of it. Hope this is helpful.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Ok.... So I'm used to buying MAC, Lancome or Clinique mascara at 5x the price. I went out on a limb with this one.... At 4.99 how could it compare? It was highly recommended so I gave it a shot. I will say..... This mascara is solid!! I love it! It delivers volume.... And length (I apply at least 2 or 3 coats ro each set of lashes)
It has lasted a month.... Im a fan re ordered and will again!!",5,4,B00T0C9XRK
"I got this based on the great reviews and price. It doesn’t compare to L’Oréal Telescopic or Lash Paradise. Volume is really poor. Length isn’t the best. The people that use this must have really nice lashes because I thought this would work great but for me, it didn’t. My lashes are decent but stick straight (no curl). So maybe that was a factor. The L’Oréal mascaras I mentioned are still the best I’ve tried for stick straight lashes. I use them both together (lash paradise first for volume and telescopic for length).",2,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Best mascara I've used in a long time. I will keep buying! Lengthening, thickens, and defines.
The only con is (and this could just be because I have oily skin) is that it does smudge. I easily fixed this by adding a coat of water-proof mascara over top.",5,3,B00T0C9XRK
"DO NOT BUT THIS! You will be 1000% hooked. I put this on just to see how it worked, my daughter and I were "" WHAT THE HELL"" IT LOOKS LIKE I HAVE FALSE Eyelashes on. NO LIE! Had it on ALL DAY! If you add a second coat look out. I'm serious ladies. I'm FIFTY FINE YEARS OLD. I have used them ALL. Including those ridiculous fibers
This is SUPREME. It comes wrapped not in any special packaging. Due to the $4.99 no special packaging to save us $$. Bought a second one immediately for my daughter!!",5,One,B00T0C9XRK
I brought this on a whim since everyone raves bout this mascara & all the positive reviews with pics & was so cheap. Was so excited to try but it came short. I have super long dark lashes naturally but they’re kinda of straight . Afters using a lash curler I applied the masacara to see the effect. The wand is too “ flexible” where u don’t have much control when applying the mascara. It clumps up so much. But It did create somewhat of falsh lashes just too much clump so I wouldn’t be raving but this. I compare this product with “Benefits It’s Real “ mascara. Bottom line i will still pay $25 for a product that works well than $5 for a mediocre item. To each is their own.,3,One,B00T0C9XRK
"I started using this after seeing a review from one of my favorite makeup YouTubers. 10/10 would recommend. This mascara looks beautiful on it's own, but I love layering it over others for extra length and volume. Not waterproof and sometimes smudges, but if you layer with a waterproof or sturdier one, i would not be worried. The best combo i've found to layer with this is the Revlon So Fierce. A+ combination--I'm kind of picky about my mascara because I don't feel like many of them do much of anything, but this is at the top of my go-to list!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I think this is a very weak product, which is a bummer because I wanted to support this company. It was recommended by numerous YouTube beauty gurus and I think the recommendation was quite incorrect. I found the formula to be a little clumpy looking on the lashes, but I like a more silken and clean appearance. It will ""volumize"" a little, but perhaps not in the way you're hoping..",3,4,B00T0C9XRK
I have tried hundreds of kinds of mascara over my life & I can clearly say that this is the best! It really covers your lashes and extends them at the same time.

"I may post photos at a later time, but I love this mascara! I have shorter lashes and this really helped me to appear to have actual lashes! Some have commented on it being clumpy during application - it can be. But I actually stick it in my bra while doing make-up and by the time it comes to my eyes, its not clumpy. Plus, I use an eyelash comb to smooth and separate my lashes. Lasts all day and it is a bit difficult to get off, but I'm okay with that - means it is lasting!",5,One,B00T0C9XRK
"The product promises length and volume, but delivered neither. I followed the advice of other reviews and wiped and wiped and wiped the wand after removing it from the tube, trying to get as little of the product on the wand before using it and ended up with clumpy, spidery lashes.

I thought it might be my application technique that was causing the problem so I looked for another mascara in my drawer. I found a FOUR-YEAR-OLD mascara that I had opened, but not used. When I used that one, I ended with long, separated, plump lashes that held a curl.

So...Essence mascara doesn't compare to a four-year-old unused mascara for me...",1,0,B00T0C9XRK

I have heard about a different brand that i think is a bit pricey, but was will to try it because i could not find anything i liked. I went on Amazon to order the pricey brand and saw. I saw all the great reviews and the photos and the GREAT PRICE. For the price I had to try it. When I received and tried it, I immediately ordered one for my mom to try. She loved it also. This is my new mascara. you won't go wrong with this!",5,One,B00T0C9XRK

"Seriously for the price why wouldn't you try it?
I have no lashes and this really helped, it's not clumping and it def helps define the lashes individually. I wouldn't say it is great volume but definition for sure. I wasn't jazzed about the brush, but will try it with another brush I prefer to see if I can get the volume I like, but I'll def be buying again. I haven't tried to remove it yet but will update if there are any issues.
Again, seriously, for the price why wouldn't you try it?",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I've been using this mascara for about a week. I like it. It goes on thick and lengthens my lashes, so i try to do two ""light"" coats. otherwise, if i swipe it on too heartily, it's too thick and deposits too much mascara too fast. At that point, the more i try to ""control"" the thickness, the goopier it gets. So, for me, a lighter touch at first works best. I did wear it on my bottom lashes once, and i found it smudged and left drops of mascara under my for that lovely raccoon effect. I only use this on my top lashes and use maybelline on my lower lashes.",5,One,B00T0C9XRK
"After years of spending way too much on the ""designer"" macaras at Sephora, etc, I discovered this mascara and I cannot possibly say how much I love it. And for the price, it's an absolute steal.

I have tried both the regular and waterproof. I did find that the waterproof burned my eyes and caused irritation, however, the regular Lash Princess is the best mascara I've ever used. No clumping, effortless extension, and I feel beautiful the moment I put it on. Easy to remove with makeup remover or baby wipes. I've been using this mascara for over a year and a half, and I find that one tube lasts several months before I need to reorder. Top notch product! I can't imagine ever switching to another brand again. Highly recommend!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I saw the rave reviews and had to get it. And why not at that price? My sister watched my apply it and was instantly sold and asked me to get her one. I have short lashes and there's an immediate difference. Also, don't move slow so that the mascara dries and then becomes a little clumpy on the lash. From all angles, I can tell my lashes are DEFINITELY longer.

I also watched Youtube vids and never knew I was applying it wrong the whole time. You have to shimmy the brush side-to-side, not from root to the tip (I hope that was clear).

I definitely plan to reorder this.",5,One,B00T0C9XRK
"I finally found a mascara that does the job! My lashes are very short. I have a very hard time using a regular eyelash curler. After reviewing I took a chance on this mascara. It lengthens my lashes noticeably. I use it it addition to a heated eye lash curler. The combination of both made huge difference for me. I would recommend just the mascara if you don’t have short lashes. If your lashes are short like mine, I would definitely recommend this mascara in addition to a heated eye lash curler.",4,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I like the product, I used the waterproof one in these pictures.. this is the first time I've tried this mascara, it's not bad and It seems to go on nicely without clumping. I haven't tried the green one, which I think the difference is one is waterproof and one isn't. The applicators on both mascaras seemed very nice and evenly coated when I pulled them out. Its late at night and these pictures are current, I just wanted to see if I liked the way it went on when I applied it, and I have no complaints yet... I'll be back to update after using it for work for a few weeks. My old mascara I used prior to this would leave black marks behind on top of my eyelids by the end of the day at work... It looks so bad and embarrassing,, hoping this doesn't do that.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK

It immediately made my eyelashes look long and full. It almost looked like I was wearing falsies. I am not someone who give accolades to many products but when one impresses me I do have to share. My husband, being a typical male, rarely notices when I put make up on until I point it out ;) But pretty much as soon as he saw me said 'hey you have that eye stuff on don't you - it looks great!""

That's number one. And I cannot stand mascara that flakes because that makes my eyes itch throughout the day as well. Number two – It goes on clumpy. It was a brand new tube that I opened up and it comes out too thick, clumpy and lumpy. I even added water in an attempt to make it go on smoother. Save your money and skip this mascara.",1,0,B00T0C9XRK

I have only used it a few times but so far, I like it more than the expensive stuff I have. Its smooth, no clumping, and I like the ""texture"" if you know what I mean. Easy to work with and get on just the way you want it. And if you want more and add more, it doesn't look like walmart false eyelashes if you know what I mean. Goes on right and looks good.",4,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I REALLY wanted to love this mascara because of all the raving reviews and the low price. The package was delivered within 2 days which was great, and the product was packaged and sealed well.
Unfortunately, the actual mascara was clumpy and dry on the wand, and did nothing except make a mess of my lashes. After 2 coats, my lashes were clumped together and showed no difference in length or lifting.
This product may work for some people, but even with a lash primer, this product did not give me the desired results. Spend the extra couple bucks and buy what you know will work.",2,0,B00T0C9XRK

Mascara is my go-to so I'd like to think I know how to put it on correctly, even if the mascara is a little old and dried out, I can still make it look good. But this mascara was incredibly hard to use from the start.. It makes your lashes clumpy and stick together, and it's formula is super loose and ""wet"" to the point where I have been consistently coming home with mascara marks under my eyebrows (where my lashes reach) and under my bottom lashes due to smudging.

"INSANE! 😱😍 Just bought this mascara and as soon as I got it and opened it I can already tell it’s my type. Drug store mascaras aren’t even priced so low and they SUCK.

The only reason I looked for a new one is because my Thrive mascara as much as I liked it, gets dry in like a month! Not even drugstore mascara lasts such a short amount of time. Usually lasts me minimum 6 months. So I’m hoping this mascara won’t dry so quickly. My eyelashes look amazing and even though I have watery red eyes due to allergies, I wore it for the first time today and there was no runny makeup. They stayed in tact throughout the day and I even worked out in it since I got right after work. It was like 9:00pm and they were still popping! I never write reviews but this one really got me. 100% recommend so far. As I said, I hope it doesn’t dry fast.

Only thing I could say that isn’t super Aweosme is the removal. It does take a few more passes than my last mascara but it’s not even an issue if they’re gonna look almost fake 😎",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I like this mascara but don’t love it, it doesn’t smudge in my experience and is easy to remove (I use micellar water). It definitely adds noticeable length but not volume, it actually makes my lashes look spidery if I don’t use a clean mascara comb to spread them back out. If you haven’t tried it I would suggest you do - I like it but was not expecting to need to spread out my lashes more than just wiggling the application brush at the base of the lashes. It’s a pretty good product though.",4,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Holy Toledo.

I have sparse and shorter lashes. A common problem in middle age, after a lifetime of assaulting my lashes with mascara. But THIS STUFF. I'm not even kidding. One quick coat and I have actual eyes. Two coats and they're insane. Three coats and Jason Mamoa comes and rides into the sunset with me. Respectfully, cause I like his wife.",5,2,B00T0C9XRK
"I heard about this mascara on Instagram from a couple of influencers so I thought I'd try it. One of the influencers has recommended other Amazon products that I have absolutely loved, so I figured this would be the same. But I was quite disappointed. It was clumpy from the first application. I've never had that happen with a new mascara before, only on open ones I've had for a while. Plus it was pretty difficult to get off. So, I'm still on the search or the perfect mascara.",2,0,B00T0C9XRK
Ok I have seen this mascara all over you tube forever and really never believed a 4.99$ mascara could be that great. Finally thought just try it it's only a few dollars if it is horrible. Well I am amazed by it. I have itsy bitsy lashes and I wanted to try it and it made a significant difference in the length with only 1 layer of mascara. Normally takes 3 layers and a curl to get the same results. I took 1 star of because it smudged after nap but that's ok. You and your wallet will love it. Try try it.,4,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I have naturally longer lashes, but I heard wonderful things about this product so decided to give it a try.

It did make my lashes look even longer and at first I loved it, however on the second or third try of using it I noticed it also made them look clumpy and whatever fibers are inside it to give it that false lash effect would fall out during wear leaving black particles all over my face.

It’s also pretty difficult to take off fully, even with an oil based remover, though I did not purchase the waterproof kind.",4,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I really like this mascara but I can't help but notice that I've bought it four times already this year. That's because in my experience it dries out after about 2.5 months. Now for the price, and the fact that it gives me dramatic lashes, I am really not bothered about this. I have mascaras that are over a year old or older (gross I know) and they still go on smoothly. But you can't expect that performance from this mascara. You will get big beautiful lashes! But you will have to toss the tube a lot sooner. A LOT sooner. But I'm ok with that. This mascara is THAT good. I was a decades-long fan of Clinique's Lash Doubling Mascara (mint green tube). But I've stopped using it altogether now. Give it a try!",4,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I like that this mascara is Cruelty Free. I also like that I can get a dark heavy lash if I want it or a light lash for daytime. It's not smudge-proof really but like some other people have said, know your product. I warm it up before I use it, just with body heat, but you could also hold it under your hot water for a min. That keeps it from being clumpy and hard to manage. Definitely take it off before bed otherwise your pillow will also be wearing your mascara.",4,One,B00T0C9XRK
"I am 61 and in my youth I had the longest thickest lashes, thanks to Menopause they are all but gone, however what I had been doing is using virgin castor oil nightly on my lashes, combined with this mascara , I can say ""wow"" it works well, it does not clump and is easy to come off. I will buy this again. I have said this with other products on Amazon, some products that are more expensive I worth putting out more money , in this case this mascara is just as good if not better than the high end brands.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"**100% AUTHENTIC & 100% TRUTHFUL REVIEW!**
Like most reviewers post, I too will only speak on a product or service that has surely made an positive or negative impact on me and I will be a straight shooter telling it like it really is and how it really happened.
With that being said; I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS MASCARA! I have learned to appreciate a good mascara from my Mum when she introduced us girls to Lancome in the 80's. As the times (and prices 😏) have changed I started true to Maybelline (green & pink). Then, I had daughters of my own and soon came this influx of makeup brands all with their own types of mascaras. Needless to say, I was overwhelmed; yet I listened to all of their reviews which led me to ESSENCE!
THIS IS IT RIGHT HERE!
>The pictures reflect before and after two coates<",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I really wanted to love this mascara because of the price and the excellent reviews (which included a makeup loving friend who recommended it). It does make my lashes look amazing. Excellent volume! But within an hour, I have raccoon eyes. I can delay the raccoon eye if I dust powder around my entire eye area, but I'm 41 and don't want to be drying my skin out like that, so I won't be purchasing this again. I have oily skin, so that may be the reason this happens to me.",3,0,B00T0C9XRK
Ordered because friends said this was their favorite and only mascara they will use. so i ordered it and i love it too! it is a little difficult to remove more so than my other brand. I use a name brand eye make up remover and seems like there is always some left and have to remove again especially what is under the eye after washing my face. I did not purchase the waterproof. but over all it's great for the price!,4,One,B00T0C9XRK
"I really liked this mascara at first and gave it a 5 star review but after using it for 3 weeks my eyes and eyelashes started to bother me. My eyelashes started falling out which has never happened and my eyes would get irritated as the day went on. Also the mascara started to get old fast, wasn’t worth the money. Now have to wait and let my eyes get better.",1,One,B00T0C9XRK
"I was so happy to receive this product as I’d seen so many fantastic reviews on it. However, from the second I opened the tube of mascara, it was very clumpy and applied clumpy. It was almost like glue and stayed wet for quite some time. So had to wait quite a bit to apply second coat which clumped even worse. And it smeared bad. Maybe I got a bad one?? Was difficult to get off with remover. Had gotten a waterproof one as well and while it applied good, it smeared too. So disappointed.",3,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Okay I would have given a 5 star review if it wasn't for arriving without a plastic surrounded on the mascara. I don't know why it didn't come seeled closed.

I know this was not a smart idea at all, however, I tried the mascara and it was not smudged but bad review for not coming in as if its new.

I curled lashes and this is how it looks. Don't mind my eyebrows please. This quaranitine has your girl looking all bad.. lol.....Very good mascara, but extremely disappointed of how it arrived.",2,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Eh...it's ok. It does make my lashes look really nice. I do wear false lashes from time to time but I'm always on the hunt for good mascara that will make my lashes look as full as possible on the days i don't wear them.
My biggest issue with this mascara is it smudges really easily for me. I kinda look like a tired raccoon by the end of the day :( I've never had this problem so much before with a mascara. I even wore it one day without any eyeliner just to be sure.
But the price is nice so I would say if you're looking for a budget friendly mascara and you are not looking for all day wear this would be an ok pick",2,0,B00T0C9XRK
"You get what you pay for. I wore this to work a couple times, I coated my bottom lashes and everything I did that I always came home with raccoon eyes. The mascara would smudge a lot when I would coat my bottom lashes and when I would coat the top lashes it would still smudge but not as much as it does when I coat my bottom lashes. Washing it off is hard as well, it doesn’t come off easily I always wake up with smudged mascara underneath my bottom lashes. I would rather pay $30 for a high end mascara cause this ain’t it.",1,One,B00T0C9XRK
"I really wanted to like this product because it’s cheap and has so many great reviews! Before ordering I was kind of skeptical because I normally wear brown mascara, and I didn’t see this as available in anything other than black. But I ordered it anyway. When it came, I rushed to the bathroom to put it on prior to a zoom meeting (I know, I’m still shocked that I put on makeup for zoom meetings too.). However, I pulled the wand out of the tube and could barely see the bristles because it was covered in so many clumps. I tried hard to brush the clumps off, but it was impossible. I applied the mascara and it was immediately Clump City on my eyelashes. Sure, they appeared longer, but they also stuck to each of their neighbors and formed little long angry black triangles on my eyelids. I didn’t even put multiple layers on - just one or two sweeps up and down. I hated the effect so much that I didn’t even put it on the second eye. This went straight into the trash. Such a bummer.",1,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Okay, I'm not usually one for leaving rave reviews... But, I've tried a lot of mascaras in my 30+ years on this planet and not one--not ONE--made me say ""Oh my God, WOW.""

This one DID.

Holy long, gorgeous lashes, Batgirl! Make sure you use the guillotine first and prepare to be wowed. This is now the only mascara I will ever use again. I didn't get the waterproof kind and did notice a teensy bit of smudge but with as awesome as it looks I don't even care. Worth every red cent.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"After reading all of the excellent reviews I finally after months and months of thought decided to give this brand a shot! Oh boy was I ever disappointed! The only good thing about this mascara is the volume is adds to your lashes. It does not build thickness, is quite difficult to wash off and definitely gets under your bottom eyelashes after hours of wear. Some may not mind these views so much, myself- I do! On the other hand, give it a try, it may end up being the best mascara you’ve ever used, just not mine.",2,0,B00T0C9XRK
"My eyelashes have never looked this good. I have used many different types and brands, I love this the best. Before is the top photo, after (1 coat on each, curled prior, and did not have to reapply it on the wand. I was able to do both eyes straight out of the bottle.)
Goes on smooth, not extremely thick. The wand itself is a small bristle type with a more petit head- works really well and doesn’t funk up the wand.

My only dislike was the tube did not come in a typical package, but with the two halves taped together. This evidently is normal.

TL;DR
Love it, my eyes have never looked this good, no actual packaging/comes taped closed.",4,5,B00T0C9XRK
This mascara is amazing. It gives me long lashes and is very buildable. It's as good as most high-priced designer mascaras and better than most. I cannot believe it is such a reasonable price. Well worth the money--you should buy a couple of tubes in both formulas (thickening & lengthening formulas). The only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars is because it does make my lashes a little still feeling and is slightly difficult to remove if you build up the layers for the best effect. I definitely recommend giving this mascara a try.,4,0,B00T0C9XRK
This mascara works great. I have almost no lashes from wearing lash extensions for the past 15 years. Yes I know but I’m addicted due to quarantine I thought I’d give this a try due to all the rave reviews. It does live up to its name. I used this on the top and bottom lashes and you can actually see lashes now lol. Imagine what it can do for someone who doesn’t have bald eyelids!!!,5,One,B00T0C9XRK
"Purchased twice at separate times.
1st tube was amazing for about 14 days straight. Lived up to all claims. Then, became dry and clumpy. Used different wand (Perversion by Urban Decay) to comb through lashes after application to smooth out Essence clumps. Also added a few drops of plain eye drops. Helped for about another week.

Purchased 2nd tube in case 1st was just a bad batch. Immediately, essence mascara was clumpy and dry. Threw out tube after about 2 weeks of trying to make it work.

Had high hopes, but it just didn't quite meet my expectations. =(",1,0,B00T0C9XRK
"So my sister told me about this mascara because we are always looking for a great mascara. I have used every name brand in the book and recently was using maybeline. I always feel I need more volume. So on my sisters praise and high recommendation I purchased this and was soooo happy.

It makes my lashes sooo full and long.
I would compare it to “IT superhero” which was one of my favorite but it dried out quick. This doesnt clump and it doesnt break off and cause little black dots under your eyes. It works amazing. I clean it off with no problem. I get compliments how nice my lashes are and if they are fake and I can thank This marcara.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I get why people like the look of this mascara, but I can't stand it. I've used it twice now and it smudges all over the place - your cheeks, your mask, your eyelids are all covered in it within minutes. I went to a gathering for 45 minutes and when I got back home, I was covered in it. AND it took forever to get it all off! It was fun to see super long lashes, but the mess I had to clean up afterwards both times made me want to throw it away. Such a waste.",2,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I purchased this mascara after reading a few reviews. Given a lower price then what I am used to paying for large name brand make-up, I was not expecting a lot. I was quite pleasantly surprised at how well it has worked. For reference I have baby fine (truly, you can barely see them without mascara on) very light blonde eye lashes. Most mascara's, even the very high priced ones, barely do much for them. However, this little gem of a mascara, makes my lashes just pop! It clings to them, makes them look thick and long. The other added benefit is, it stays on till you take it off. The price is amazing for the quality. I will definetly be purchasing more.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"This is one of the better mascaras that Ive used. I’m always trying different brands only to be let down. But this is fantastic! It gives my bland lashes great length and volume! The only shortfall in my opinion is by days end, it’s a bit wore off but by days end, and for $5 I’m okay with sprucing up with another coat if I’m planning to go out without time to re-do my makeup! I hope this stays on the market...I’ll be stocking up to be sure I have a supply!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I read about this mascara on Pinterest as a “best drugstore mascara” so I decided to give it a try. It’s only 5 bucks right? I honestly had never even heard of this brand before but again 5 bucks. I got it and the first day I was this is ok not bad at all. The second day I did more coats and OMG this is seriously the best ever! I have tried soooo many brands but this one is my favorite so far. It makes me look like I have eyelashes the volume is pure magic. There is no flaking all over my face, it is pretty easy to wash off but also almost waterproof—if that makes sense. I am putting this on subscribe. You should try it out!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Here’s an honest review touching on things people dislike about this mascara! I like it! It definitely gives my lashes a lot of volume! Everyone thinks I have fake lashes on when I wear it! With that being said, there are a few things I don’t like about it. It’s very thick. I have to scrap the brush off on the edges of the container to get a majority of the mascara off before applying it. Then I run a comb brush (it’s actually used for eyebrows) through my lashes to get the clumping out. NOBODY likes clumpy mascara! I didn’t notice any of the mascara flaking off through out the day. I always apply multiple coats, so I just applied a coat of my normal mascara at the end. Maybe that did the trick?! I didn’t notice any eye irritation either. Lastly, I didn’t notice it being any harder to take off than any other mascara. Overall, this mascara is quite a bit of work, so it’s not your ideal everyday mascara. I definitely tend to use it only for special occasions or when I’m going out, as it does take some time to apply. For $5 I really can’t complain! It does make my lashes look fabulous!",4,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I've gone thru a few different brands of mascaras because while I have LONG lashes and plentiful, they're NOT very noticeable because I'm blond. This mascara does the trick! It made my lashes suddenly appear and look amazing! No need to curl them myself - the mascara does it all!

Only draw-back is there was some clumping right away - but applying a dry spoolie really helped with that - super-simple fix and my lashes look great. Love this stuff!",4,0,B00T0C9XRK
I have looked high and low for a great mascara that gives me coverage and is relatively easy to remove. This is as close as I have come. It goes on great and only a few coats make my lashes look long and thicker. Be careful not to over apply and allowed to dry between coats to get the best look. If I don't remove all of it the night before it will Clump the next day so be careful in your nightly routine. Very pleased with this mascara and I will definitely be purchasing again.,5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I saw this on so many lists of products that people loved, and now that I’ve tried it I don’t get it. It is SO clumpy. Most times I put it on, I immediately feel like I need to wash it off and try again so I don’t go to work with spider lashes. And it rubs off on my brow bone throughout the day. I even tried it with a different brush to see if the formula would work better with a different brush, but it still gave me clumpy lashes. Sort of disappointing.",2,0,B00T0C9XRK
Love this mascara! The best I have used in a long time! My lashes have never looked like this. I am a redhead and I have trouble finding make-up that isn't going to irritate my skin or my eyes. This is the first mascara I have bought that hasn't irritated my eyes. It also comes off pretty well if you use makeup remover. If you want to have the long lashes without fake or irritating mascara then I would buy this product. It doesn't clump or flake like most mascara. This is definitely a product I will buy again.,5,2,B00T0C9XRK
"I heard such good things about this brand I went ahead and purchased the double pack. One regular and one waterproof. I fell asleep with the waterproof on and in the morning it was smuged under my eye. It was well dried, I'd had it on all day. Waterproof should NEVER smudge while sleeping. No excessive sweating (which shouldn't matter anyway, and once I fall asleep I'm not a restless sleeper. Also didn't notice much length or volume. Quite disappointed.",3,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I love that this product is vegan and this affordable. For decades I've used the same mascara because others make my eyelashes itch (weird, I know). For $5 I decided to give this a try. Very pleased. It's a little tough to get off, but my gf (who recommended this mascara to me) told me she uses a small bit of coconut oil and it comes right off. I will be trying that for sure. I love how pointy the brushes are on the wand; almost like little spikes. Really helps to separate the lashes so that they get full coverage from the mascara.",5,One,B00T0C9XRK
"What I love about this mascara...
Easy to remove
Does help with volume
What I dont like .....
Will eventually creep down and smudge under eye after 6 hours after application. Yes I did time this.
Can be prone to some clumps but easily fixed when removing excess off of applicator before applying.
....over all I am happy with this product, I am glad I dont have to fight taking it off at night so that is a HUGE plus for me.",4,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I don’t even want to give this product 1 star. It messed my eyes up. My left eye ended up with a very hard bump directly underneath my eyelid, eyes were red and swollen and in so much pain. I’ve used this mascara before and it was fine. This time it was completely different. It took two full weeks for my eyes to feel normal after discontinuing use. This isn’t worth it. Don’t buy it. After reading other reviews it seems others have had the same issue",1,0,B00T0C9XRK
"It’s....just mascara. Have one eye this brand and another eye is a different brand. Couple of applications on each. My life has not just suddenly become amazing. Birds and mice did not make me a beautiful ball gown. Disappointed.

Will try again tomorrow for magical.",4,One,B00T0C9XRK
"My experience with the seller was great. No issues. The product on the other hand leaves a lot to be desired. It is very ""gloppy"". I have to clean off all the excess on the brush before I use. Even after cleaning it goes on very clumpy and binds my lashes together so it looks like I have very thick mashed together lashes. Due to all this, it is very messy! It's so clumpy that it flakes off and smears on my face or sticks to my eye lid. I usually buy my mascara from Estee Lauder and spend much more and love the product. Thought I would give this one a try because it was rising in popularity, but, honestly, the best thing I can say, paying just under $5 for it, you get get what you pay for. :(",1,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I purchased this mascara based on the images and the promises of dramatic volume and length with no clumps. Also, the great reviews didn't hurt... I found that my lashes were nicely coated and didn't clump, however, the length didn't appear any longer (even with two or three coats) and overall, the effect wasn't any different from any other mascara. It certainly didn't give the effect of false lashes as claimed. It washed off easily. The best thing: the low cost. I would recommend simply for the price.",3,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Seems like you’re putting oil on your eyelashes — black oil. It smears so fast. I didn’t even put that much product, just in case it smeared. Literally like an hour later I go to the bathroom, look in the mirror and I have raccoon eyes. Haven’t worn such a cheap product since the early 2000’s. I buy all my makeup at Sephora and MAC. The only thing I buy that’s cheap is mascara because my eyelashes are already long, however, I stick to drugstore mascara because it’s beautiful and never fails. Idk why I bought this.",1,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I have purchased probably over 100 different kinds of mascaras in my life. This one is by far the best and I will never buy anything else! I curl my eyelashes and this makes them stay put!

It is harder to get off but I use a good makeup wipe and have no issues. I couldn't recommend this more!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"been using this for years. was disappointed when target stopped carrying it but i was SO happy to find it on amazon. i’ve tried every high end and drug store mascara and nothing beats this one. it comes off with ease yet stays on when i cry or have an allergy attack. looks amazing, dries quickly and lasts. i will never stop purchasing this. nothing makes my lashes look this good, unclumped, long and luscious",5,One,B00T0C9XRK
"I didn’t get what I ordered. Instead of the 3 mascaras I ordered I got 3 packs of false lashes. They were nice, but not what I ordered. The box was opened in front of my niece so I had to pretend I had meant to order my 15 year old niece false lashes and then explain to my sister why I had done that! :( I’m quite sure if I wanted lashes I wouldn’t have ordered mascara.",1,8,B00T0C9XRK
"The first time I bought this mascara I was completely taken in, it was wonderful. It stuck to my lashes without being sticky and they looked elongated. The second bottle is not the same. I don’t believe they’re able to keep up with the demand of the product as the second bottle is very dry and flaky. It doesn’t apply onto my eyelashes but instead flakes off onto my cheeks and in my eyes. I might give this one more try but if the third bottle is the same then I would discontinue use.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Like so many others, I have tried countless brands of mascara ranging from drug store types to expensive brands. This is as perfect a mascara as one can get.

I liked it the first time I used it, until I looked in the mirror and it completely dropped and I had beautiful smudges under my eyes, raccoon eyes for days! To get this off is a PAIN! Seriously I think I lost a layer of skin trying to scrape this off. I think I get it all at night, then poof a beautiful raccoon appears again in the mirror the next morning as I sadly brush my teeth.

Let me just say that I have used EVERY mascara out there from Definicils, DiorShow, Roller Lash, Lash Paradise, Better Than Sex, Monsieur Big, just to name a few. This one is right up there with the expensive brands. It took several coats to achieve what I get in one or two swipes with Monsieur Big (Lancome) but it did the job and for the price, I'll definitely take the extra swiping! No flaking, dripping, rub-off, etc. but was a bit hard to remove. Overall, great mascara though. I have NEVER once been disappointed by Essence products - their lip plumping gloss in one of my must-haves.",4,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I have short & sparse lashes. One swipe of this mascara makes a DRAMATIC improvement. The best part is that it doesn't clump or feel heavy like so many volumizing mascaras do. No need for a second wand. You can apply and keep swiping to straighten the lashes. The only problem I've had with it is that it does wear within about 5-6 hours & requires a little under eye cleanup & reapplication. This could be due to me wearing contact lenses, but I don't think so since it doesn't bother my eyes like so many mascaras have in the past. I will definitely be buying again if this doesn't dissapear like all other fabulous products tend to do.",5,One,B00T0C9XRK
"Ok so I saw this product on about a hundred of those articles like ""8000 things I bought on Amazon and love"" ""1 Million things to buy on Amazon for Christmas"" etc, you know the ones...anywayZ..... I have spent $20+ on mascaras that were junk so I figured for this price let's give it a try.
Surprise, surprise, this mascara is amazing!!! I love the length of the wand (it's a LOT longer than most) and the brush. The formula is not clumpy at all and goes on effortlessly . I gave it 4 stars only because I wish it also had thickening properties but as it is (for length) 5 ⭐ !",4,One,B00T0C9XRK
"Converted. I love expensive mascara, but for nearly 20 years, I always came back to Maybelline Great Lash for the price tag. This was suggested to me, and I figured, ""why not?"" And it is SO MUCH BETTER! I love how the brush is shaped, which allows for very even and full distribution in far less time. I use micellar water for makeup removal, and it comes off very easily at the end of the day.

All in all, a worthy purchase I will likely make again!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I have literally paid almost $40 for mascara before cause I have short blonde lashes with watery eyes. When the expensive stuff didn't work, I started trying all the ""cheap"" ones. Coming across this was a miracle! It's the only one I use now! My lashes look thicker, it gives them some length, and it doesn't smear or smudge despite my watery eyes. ONLY negative for me personally is that it is hard to fully wash off even with makeup remover. First layer comes off easily but the lashes stay tinted. I like everything off to go to bed, but it's not too big a deal cause the product is definitely worth the money!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"As a 56 year old gal with diminishing lashes, this stuff is a miracle!!!!!!!! I have not been able to find decent mascara for YEARS!!! I don't even need to wear my falsies anymore, I'm not kidding. The stuff is magical. Stays fine as long as you powder under your lash line and wait till it drys. Oh and if that's not enough, the container design is very comfortable to hold! I can't say enough about it, great price too!! Perfect Perfect",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
The first time I pull the brush out the mascara it was clumpy. Im not sure if this is an old one or not. But this is not good. I bought two. One to keep and one as a present. I will not be giving this to anyone. Bad mascara. The worst I have ever bought.,1,One,B00T0C9XRK
This photo doesn't do this product justice..but I took it because I barely/quickly/halfway applied the mascara and it made my lashes POP. EXCELLENT QUALITY and price is awesome! Only wish it curled. I'll take the time to curl them next time and apply thoroughly. Wish they had a curling wand/applicator and wish it was easier to remove. Other than that- EXCELLENT! Take time removing and take time applying and you'll be happy you did. :),5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"After reading reviews on other sites and seeing the before and after pics I was excited to try this! I looked for it at CVS and Walgreens and couldn’t find it so I ordered it on here!

Unfortunately it came completely unsealed and I couldn’t tell if it had been used or tampered with! Made me nervous putting it on my eyes! After looking at more reviews on here, it seems this is the norm. I tried the mascara and did like it but wouldn’t buy it off here again unfortunately! For $5 I’ll provably buy a fresh one at the store! Good mascara, bad amazon purchase!",1,3,B00T0C9XRK
"This product definitely gave me definition and fullness to my lashes. However I didn’t notice anything different about the overall length. Not mad about it, but if it’s going to claim to give me false lash effect then I would have liked to have a little more length as well.",4,One,B00T0C9XRK
"1. My order came wrapped in plastic. Some have said that their order had no plastic covering and they were concerned with tampering and safety.

2. It hasn't been clumpy for me.

3. If I run my eyes at night, it has smudged.

4. It comes off easily with myicr cellular water.

Overall, I am happy with this mascara. I have straight and thin eyelashes. It does help them look longer but for me it isn't a flash eyelash look. I only put on one coat because I don't like the spider eye look. Sometimes I need to use a pin to separate my eyelashes if I get it too clumpy. I wipe the wand on the sides before I put it on. I would probably buy it again. I liked what I received for the cost.",4,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I all around love this mascara from the price to the quality! All I really wear for makeup is eyeliner and mascara so they have to be good and I don't think I could find a better quality mascara for $4.99. In the pic it's a little clumpy but if I had a little brush to go over my eyelashes with before applying it don't think that would be an issue because is isn't always clumpy. You cam seethe differenceit makes for the lift and length of my lashes and justinprovesthwur overall appearance. I even applied it to the eye whereb my lashes aren't as thick and full. Just a shout out to Bailey Sarian because if it wasnt for her saying how great this product was never would have bought it, she should be getting sponsored by Lash Princess!!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Underwhelmed. I heard all the hype so I thought I'd give this a try. For years I wore lash extensions (until the pandemic, then no more due to $$$). So many reviews claimed to be like extensions, this is false.
It makes my lashes very ""crispy"", or dry and sharp, and is very clumpy. It didn't add any length to my lashes. Lashblast mascara has worked much better for me.
I have yet to fimd any mascara that truly looks like extensions. If you want that look, you're going to have to dish out the money to get it.",3,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I had heard great feedback about this mascara but was disappointed. It is a good mascara but not a great mascara. I use an eyelash curler and find this mascara is to wet and heavy to keep my curl. As soon as I apply the mascara I can literally see my lashes uncurl and look blah. Yes they look a bit longer and darker but they just lay there looking Blah Blah Blah!!!!
A great mascara shouldn't be so heavy it weighs down your lashes.
Mascara should be lite so you can keep your curl and your eyes go Pop Wow!!!!",3,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Love this! So much volume and so little dollars!! My only complaint is sometimes at the end of the day I have smudges under the eyes. I usually check throughout the day to catch it and it’s not a problem if I do not apply a lot to the lower lashes. Maybe if I got a waterproof version this would not happen? Either way. I’m ok with having to check my makeup a little more often.

Works better than the $35 one I was using.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"The moment they showed up at my door I had to put it on and try it out! I ordered the 3-pack because I saw all of their review pictures and all of the girls eyelashes looked amazing! And I am happy that I did, now there is one for my mom and I and an extra one for when one runs dry. I definitely love this stuff, it feels good going on and it's smooth without being clumpy, and it is super light! Make the eyelashes fluff out like crazy.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
Some reviews were comparing this to Tarte lights camera lashes and I just don't see the comparassion. Its good for the price but I've definitely used better. Its volumizing but it clumps very easily and a little goes a long way. With how highly reviewed this is I was hoping that I finally found an amazing cheaper mascara but I wasn't as impressed as I hoped. Its worth a try and I'll keep it around but I won't use this everyday.,3,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Love it? Meh. It’s ok. Definitely not the showstopper that everyone keeps talking about it as. It’s good, and for the price it’s a deal. In the photos I posted, my left die I used Maybelline lash sensational, and on my right eye I used this product. To be honest they both look the same to me LOL the Maybelline one is a little bit more expensive but I already had it… I don’t think it does any elongating for my lashes either. Overall it’s a good product but not The “oh my God stop everything and go buy this” kind. Either way, I like it fine and might purchase again.",4,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I normally do not leave negative reviews, but I am always spending money to try new things and this was a waste. It is not at all as it is describes, it smudges everywhere, it flakes, and clumps. After reading some good reviews, I was so disappointed. But I will say at least it came fast, it was properly sealed and before it begins to flake and smudge, it coats heavy enough after one coat. It’s a good thing I don’t wear contacts anymore though, or I’d have such problems.",2,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I sent the first one received back for a replacement. I thought it was too thick and blobby...flaked off lashes. Second one (replacement) arrived and it is the same way. Guess I was expecting a great product after reading reviews, but extremely disappointed. I threw the second one away because replacement probably would have been the same. It felt more like ""old"" mascara, not fresh mascara. I do not recommend this product",1,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I was so excited for this mascara. It unfortunately is not the holy grail of mascara. Imagine spider legs on your eyes but they smudge so you kinda resemble a drunken mess, at work, by noon. Even with the waterproof one, it smudges everywhere. My lashes clumped together and every 20 minutes I had to wipe under my eyes to remove the mushy spider legs. I’m wondering if I got two bad bottles or if 90% of these reviews are fake.",1,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I do not usually leave reviews, but this stuff is AMAZING! I typically use a volume mascara and then a 4D mascara over it but I get more volume and length with this stuff then I do with multiple coats of both of my regulars! A definite must have for anyone wanting look at me lashes!",5,One,B00T0C9XRK
"This mascara is the BeST! However, don’t leave it out in extreme heat in the car haha. When it starts drying out it the mascara doesn’t stay on well and leaves little flecks of mascara around your eye... but this ONLY happened to me after several months of use and leaving it in the car in 100+ degree heat it’s the summer. I haven’t had a problem since I stopped leaving makeup in the car hahaha. By far the best mascara! Even better than $25 mascara that I’ve tried",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"This is one of my new favorite mascaras, I have naturally long lashes & never curl them, this goes on so easy, separates my lashes great with very little effort, curls & lengthens my lashes & gives a great lift without clump either, it gives me the false lash look that I am looking for & is very buildible!
You can't beat the price & I love that it is cruelty free! Definitely try this!
Update: I've added a photo, this was 2 light coats of mascara put on at 7am before work, this picture was taken at 11pm, I am amazed at how well this mascara held up & does not flake!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"It's okay, but its vegan and cruelty free so that's why I'll keep it. You'll need to wipe the edge off on the tube before applying because if you don't it'll apply way too much product and it'll clump up. Anyway, I do like the waterproof mascara from this brand, but it isn't for daily wear because it's REALLY hard to get off. This however doesn't remove easy either. You'll need more than just face wash. I used facial oil, and it removed instantly. Unlike the purple water proof tube which I have to soak off for several minutes with oil.",3,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Wow! I have short, thin, straight lashes. This stuff is great! It's a little more clumpy than I'd normally like, but I think if I used a lash comb after application, it would remedy that. I just haven't found mind yet 🤦🏻‍♀️

First image is 1 done, one bare. Second is both done (different days).

Pro tip: scrape the excess product off of the wand back into the tube before application.",5,2,B00T0C9XRK
"I really love this mascara and can’t beat the price. It goes on easy, love the brush, it makes my lashes long and keeps them separated. I will say make sure to use makeup setting spray because it can sometimes smudge onto upper lid or under lower lashes if it’s hot or you’re sweaty. But no flaking, no clumps. I use it daily, one or two coats and sometimes add a waterproof mascara as the final layer to ensure it stays on well.",4,0,B00T0C9XRK
Bought this after hearing some hype about it. I did like the way it looks when first put on. It does add volume not just length. You do need to brush clumps out. Now for the down side. Unfortunately it doesn’t wear well - even to just a regular day use. It will smudge under your eyes. It doesn’t make it through the day. You will need make up remover to remove it and get all the smudge off the skin. Sigh.. I’m still seeking the perfect mascara!,2,0,B00T0C9XRK
Leaves residue for days.,4,3,B00T0C9XRK
"I would give this mascara zero stars if it was possible. I found that it definitely clumped my normal eyelashes together so that they looked like spiders legs. The major problem is that they may be cruelty free but definitely not hypoallergenic. Are used it three days ago. For the last two days my eyelids have been swollen, red, and incredibly itchy. My lower eyelids are also swollen, red, and itchy. It looks like I was in some kind of fight, or that I had been crying for a very long time. The swelling and the itch have made it impossible for me to wear my contacts. I guess I just paid $4.99 to be miserable for the last two days. I wouldn’t recommend this product to my worst enemy, not that I have any enemies. Do not waste your money on this product. I am going to give the other new mascara called thrive a try.",1,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I saw this on a Facebook ad about 30 things worth your money on Amazon and decided to give it a try. It was a great price and I was so impressed with this mascara. My lashes are shorter since getting older and having kids. This gave me my lash length back and then some! It's very light and I forget I have it on! Minimal clumping, it's mascara so it's ging to happen but honestly, I have more expensive mascara that clumped worse! Pleasant smell that didn't irritate my eyes. It will smuge some if you forget it's on and rub your eyes! Even with two coats one, it's still light and I forget about it. It washes off with soap and water but I woukd recommend a makeup remover as some residue will linger after you wash your face.
Again, common with mascara. I'll be buying this again for sure!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Disappointed after reading so many rave reviews. It's just an okay mascara, I feel like it clumps really easily. I have to comb my lashes after I apply it. Today I wiped the excess off on the rim before applying and it didn't clump but it's not exactly the most hygienic practice so.... Also it takes a loooong time to dry so for the first hour or so it's incredibly easy to smudge (sneezing, looking up, or making any faces where you're lashes hit your lids), so that's annoying. Won't be buying again.",3,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I never write reviews until I have used a product for several weeks, but I am making an exception in this case. I got the mascara, put it on and walked into the living room. My husband took one look at me and said, ""Your eyes stand out. What did you do? as he didn't even know the mascara was delivered. That's proof enough for me. No flaking or smudging and it cleaned off easily. I will be buying this again and again.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I was pleased with the fast shipping, even though I am not a Prime member; I ordered on a Saturday and received the product two days later on Monday. I was hopeful to try this mascara and have it perform as well as the brand I had been previously using. The price, of course, was hard to beat. I applied the mascara at 0515 in the morning but by mid-morning, the product had started to smudge and cause me to have raccoon eyes. Granted, I work 12-hour shifts as an RN in a busy operating room, so I wear N95 and surgical masks pretty much all day. At the end of my day, approximately 19 hours later, the mascara was a bit difficult to remove. I needed both eye makeup remover and facial cleanser to fully remove it. On the plus side, the mascara did lengthen my lashes well, but didn’t really increase volume. Unfortunately, this mascara isn’t the one for me, and I will most likely be returning to my previous brand.",3,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Love this mascara! I buy it over and over again. It makes my lashes look gorgeous. I don’t have very long lashes but it almost gives an appearance of false lashes or extensions. I get compliments all the time when I wear it. I use coconut oil based makeup remover, so it’s less toxic and takes a little more work to get this off. I recommend taking it off before getting into the shower, it will run down your face. After you apply it and it dries, it won’t smudge (unless you get it wet). My eyes have watered with it on, and it never ran. It just got wet again and needed to dry. So don’t touch it when it’s in a wet state unless you want smear.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I’m super picky about mascara and have been searching forever for one that’s not clumpy, dry, smudgy, hard to get off, etc... I’m so excited I finally found it! This mascara is honestly the best mascara I’ve found in this price range ever. It goes on smoothly with minimal clumpiness. The wand is shaped perfectly and it’s large enough that you don’t have to spend forever trying to get it on. It didn’t smudge, but washes off easily with a makeup remover wipe. It makes your eyelashes look nice and full and dark. HIGHLY recommended!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
This mascara is THE best!!! It goes on beautifully & comes off easily with makeup remover. I haven’t had any issues with smudging. And the price is awesome as well. I’ve tried different brands constantly searching for the best one...I think this is it!,5,One,B00T0C9XRK
"I have no idea how this mascara is rated so highly! The version of this mascara with the green writing on the tube gave me raccoon eyes big time! I had mascara that rubbed off on my upper and lower eyelids in less than 3 hours after application! I wiped it away & fixed my makeup, then sure enough, a few hours later it happened again! This stuff is garbage, not to mention it clumped on my lashes! I will be throwing it away & 0/10 would not recommend to anyone!",1,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I had heard lots of good things about this mascara, so I was eager to try it out! It provides awesome volume and length and I love the consistency of the mascara....but it flakes off so much during the day! If I put it on in the morning, by mid-afternoon I have dark smudges under my eyes from the mascara just falling off during the day. When it comes time to take it off at night when I wash my face, it is so hard to get all the way off. Overall, it wasn't worth it for me.",2,0,B00T0C9XRK
This Mascara is one of the best I have ever used. Everyone is complimenting me on my long lashes and it is because of using Lash Princess False Lash Effect Mascara. I have purchased a few as little gifts and the recipients love the great product too. It really works well and adds volume and length to the lashes without clumping or smudging. Well worth the amazing low price it is being offered. The Mascara is really worth giving it a try. I guarantee you will be satisfied. Pennie B.,5,0,B00T0C9XRK
You'll have to excuse my face but I applied 2 light coats of the mascara at 6:45am the picture was taken around 11pm! After a 10 hour work day and basic hectic life.... I'm not mad at all! There is some raccoon eyes going on and the full volume has lessened but for a $5 mascara this is awesome! I would just say to maybe not put it on the lower lashes but I've tried $20 mascara that doesn't do as well as this! Would definitely buy again!,4,One,B00T0C9XRK
"When used by itself, I didn’t care for this mascara because it didn’t add a lot of fullness or length. However, when I add it after 2 coats of my other mascara (4-D silk fibers) it does add length. How long it lasts seems to depend but I don’t know on what. Also, when worn alone, despite using eyelid primer, the mascara constantly smeared on to my eyelids after a few hours, but doesn’t seem to if used in combination. Very black color",4,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I've tried so many good, expensive mascaras in the past couple of years, and all are flaked off to the point of being nonexistent by lunch. This mascara is so smooth, goes on perfectly, and I still have lashes at the end of the day! I've already bought a second one so I won't run out, and I'll be using this regularly. The product came quickly. Very satisfied with the purchase from start to finish. And great price!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I gave this mascara two stars for the two things I really liked about it. The first thing is the price. Fantastic! The second thing is that it’s cruelty free! Awesome!
For me, that is where it ended. I ordered the non-waterproof type. I found I had raccoon eyes by midday and it was difficult to wipe that off. Also, when washing it off, at night, it was difficult to completely remove.
I also found that it clumped when applying. I spent so much time separating my lashes!
I have now returned to my mascara primer and non-waterproof mascara that doesn’t cause raccoon eyes..
I really wanted to like this!",2,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I'm honestly surprised at how good this mascara is, especially since I've never heard of this brand before. My natural lashes are not very long and I'm always trying high end mascaras. This mascara goes on smooth with very minimal clumping, and does not smudge. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because I was hoping for that 'false lash' effect. It definitely lengthens my lashes, but I don't see any difference between this and other high end mascaras that claim 'false lash' effect. However, because this price is so much cheaper, I will stick with this one!",4,0,B00T0C9XRK
It’s great! Shocked at the quality given the price. I use as regular mascara and apply a single light coat. Not building for the “false” look since I am happy enough with the volume and length of my lashes already. I really like how I can use just a bit of product. Also holds curl well - which I’ve never found to be the case with non water proof. I’ve tried with and without primer and didn’t need it. This will be my forever go to mascara.,5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I have heard about this product many times and decided to finally try it. With most mascaras, the first couple uses are amazing and then it's downhill from there. Not the case with this one - it didn't even impress me on the first application. I was expecting full, lifted, falsie-esque lashes with this mascara as promised and instead it came out clumpy and heavy. My lashes received minimal lift using this and it certainly wasn't worth the extra $5 over the drugstore brand I've been using for years. Maybe it wasn't the ""real thing"" as I know that happens with some Amazon products but I'm still super disappointed.",3,0,B00T0C9XRK
I put up Before & After pictures. I usually wear a Loreal Voluminous mascara and I don't feel as if my results are any different. Two good things about this mascara is it is half the price of my day to day mascara and it is easily washed off but not as easily as my mascara I always use which is good for some people. I personally don't care for waterproof mascara because when I take it off it always remove some of my lashes. This mascara is more durable than the Voluminous by it still comes off with soap and water like I prefer.,5,0,B00T0C9XRK
I’m 63 years old and this mascara adds so much volume to my lashes. I waited a few days before posting my review because I wanted to give it some time to be fair. This mascara last all day long and doesn’t smear or flake. I didn’t realize I was buying the waterproof kind until I went to take it off and had to use cold cream. I should have realized it when my eyes were watering from allergies and the mascara didn’t run. I will buy this product again.,5,0,B00T0C9XRK
I’m pretty sure I have literally tried every mascara that exists. From $80 to the drugstore ones for $10. I bought this from a fb review then read the reviews on Amazon and I was sold. Figured it would be just like all the others just cheaper. I was wrong. I have no idea how it comes off because I didn’t get that far yet. I don’t even care because even if I gets clumpy tomorrow it’s definitely worth buying this for one use. Yes! It’s that good. My lashes look long and natural and they’re not sticking together. I’m going to add 5 more to my cart as soon as I’m done typing this. I feel like I just had eyelash extensions done that’s how amazing I feel.,5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I really bought this the first time as a joke because of how cheap it is. I love mascara.... I like lots of mascara. This mascara is amazing. I normally spend over 20.00 for mascara. I was stunned how good it was. My mom and I were out for lunch and she asked if I had false eyelashes on. I use to have long nice lashes, but now that I am older I need all the help I can get. This is my second tube. So worth it. Note: This is an honest to god true review. I know how frustrating it is to see thousands of ratings all above 4 and so you get it and its not even close to being a good product. I feel this product is really good",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I love this mascara and use it for every day use as well as for a night out. It creates the voluminous look on my lashes. I prefer my lashes to look full and long and this mascara does both! For every day use I put on about 2 coats (which I do with any mascara), when I'm going for a more full look, I will add a few extra coats to really achieve the full look.
This product is easy to wipe off and doesn't damage my lashes during removal. I don't notice it to smudge badly unless I rub my eye excessively.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I was skeptical of something so inexpensive. However I had heard so many good things about it that I thought it was worth a shot.
It lives up to the hype! Every time I wear it I get asked if I am wearing false lashes. It’s one of those mascaras that gets better after a few uses, so if at first you are not blown away, give it a few more tries.
Although it is not the waterproof formula, it does hold up to water well. I use baby shampoo as my eye makeup remover and it comes right off.
I have purchased this so many times and will continue to do so.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Idk why this had such good reviews on amazon.. This crap smears everywhere. The application brush makes it super clump on your lashes. and no matter how hard i scrub my eyes in the shower, i always get lingering mascara under my eyes for DAYS after i last used it.
I now use my Covergirl Lash Blast applicator brush with it to at least solve the clumping issue..I'll use it until i just cant stand it anymore, but im already so close to pitching it.",1,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Okay so I tried it, the end result it would make my eyelashes collapse after I did one coat. When I did manage to keep my eyelashes up yes the mascara did look nice but I don’t think it’s for me.

I thought it applied nicely and looked pretty comparable to my go-to, BUT after just 3-4 hours of wear it was transferrred all over my lid by my eyebrow. I should mention that I do not have long lashes, but for the rest of the day I had to constantly touch up and wipe off my eyelids and brow bone. Will not be using again, too bad, I wanted it to work.",3,0,B00T0C9XRK
Love love this mascara. I’ve tried ALOT of mascaras I have very thin blonde eyelashes and this mascara makes them long plump full. I put on two coats letting kinda dry inbetween going across the tips first to make length. Wears well all day cleans off easily. Good price. I like the brush on this green bottle it’s straight and makes your lashes perfect. I’ve been happy with this product since I saw it advertised on a good morning America show.,5,One,B00T0C9XRK
"This mascara is horrible. I read it was a best seller and really wanted to love it. I used it for about 5 weeks and then threw it away. Horrible, thick, clumpy stuff.

"I am always up to try a new product, especially for lashes because we're all searching for those lush and beautiful lashes. So when this product says it's the best out there and has great ratings, of course I try. But this mascara is no good. Its easy application and the brush is a good size. The formula seemed okay. No difference from any other drug store mascara. This also gave me racoon eyes within hours. There was a lot of fall out and it seems it all doesn't stick well or stay long enough. But this is the only mascara that has given me this bad of a racoon eye, within such a short time frame.
I will not recommend to anyone and I'm not sure I am going to do with the tube I have now.",1,0,B00T0C9XRK
"This is honestly probably the best mascara I've ever owned and you can't beat the price. I don't like using fake lashes and tend to try to purchase cost-effective items which in the world of mascara is usually not impressive. This makes my lashes look significantly longer, it is a great price, and it doesn't make my lashes clump up like others have. I will probably be sticking with this item from this point on. I am definitely impressed - I bought it because of the reviews.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I’ve used L’Oréal Telescopic Mascara for years. Thought I would try something different. I didn’t care for this mascara. I like a long, separated look. The brush is too large to get the detail I like. I gave it to my daughter. She said the same thing. She likes the formula but didn’t care for the brush. She said she may try it wit another mascara brush she has. I’m going to stick with L’Oréal. It works for me.",2,0,B00T0C9XRK
It does glide on nicely and lengthens the lashes. It does smudge slightly but for the most part looks good after 9 hours of wear. I do not like that it is hard to remove. I have to wash my eyes a few times and it still does not completely remove the mascara. I don’t like this since it’s not good for me to rubbing my eyes so much. That is the only drawback though. I like the rubber grip on the handle. It also came sealed.,3,0,B00T0C9XRK

"I purchased this after seeing it on an external website list as one of the premiere products to purchase. Is it a miracle worker? No. Does it work as well as prestige brands? Yes. In that sense it is a great value. For me, I use a drugstore brand for volumizing and it’s been the best I’ve used across the boards. I like to layer this on top of that for a bit of extra drama. I always have to use an eyelash separator though, which is something I rarely normally use. This formula clumps. But as long as I have it, I’ll use it!",3,0,B00T0C9XRK
Arrived quickly with prime. Love the design of the product. Price I thought was fabulous for a false lash type mascara. Really liked that it's not goopy. So you don't have excessive product coming out. I'm not a big makeup person. More of the average wear type make-up. So I think this mascara can work for variety of make-up skilled people. Very happy with my purchase and definitely going to be my new go to.,5,0,B00T0C9XRK

Let me tell you that I have tried everything they sell at Sephora and nothing has done what this little voodoo mascara does. I don’t know how it fight gravity!? My lashes are untamable, stubborn and full of gravity. But this mascara has some sort of magic or I don’t know what... I am so happy with this product and the best part is the price! I can actually use it daily and I don’t have to be stingy with it because it’s cheap! So don’t buy that Frappuccino and just try this mascara!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"My lashes are very light colored and look almost nonexistent without mascara. Even with a ""good"" mascara like Cover Girl Lash Blast Extensions they don't stand out. I have never in my life had the kind of length and volume like I do with Lash Princess False Lash Effect - it is truly unbelievable. Not only that, but the cost is ridiculous! Five bucks?! How do they do this? The holy grail of mascaras indeed! You can find it at CVS too but it costs more there.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I bought this because Bailey Sarian said it’s her favorite mascara of all time and it was cheap. However, I have tried this mascara on three occasions and every time, within 30 minutes, it has smudged and given me raccoon eyes. It doesn’t do much in the sense of volume for my eyelashes and I normally don’t have an issue with that with other brands. Honestly, just spend the extra money in a decent mascara.",1,0,B00T0C9XRK
"At first use, I was obsessed with this mascara. I included a picture with what my lashes normally look live vs. with this mascara, and I don't think my lashes ever looked so long! However, as many people have complained about, this mascara smudges like no other mascara I have ever used. I don't know if it is because I am not properly prepping around my eyes (I don't really wear other make up right now since I wear a mask all day at work!) but this mascara smudges completely under my eye and I even see marks where my upper lashes touch my upper eyelid. Again, this could be caused my the lack of other make up or even more moisture hitting my eyes due to wearing a mask all day, but it's a BAD look. I love how awesome this mascara makes my lashes look though so I am going to try the waterproof formula and update this review if that one smudges less!",3,0,B00T0C9XRK

 as much as i liked the effect of this mascara on day 1, i have to warn y'all to NOT risk this! first of all, my tube came wrapped in what appeared to be dingy plastic wrap (like you'd wrap food in) and i cannot confidently say that it wasn't used. actually the brush didn't have the fresh, neat look a new mascara wand usually does!! but idk!! anyways - on day 2 of use, my eyes became very red, itchy, irritated and painful and i look at them a few minutes later and they've gotten this bad (see the video i uploaded). i've never had this issue before and this is the only thing i've done differently with my eyes/face products. they are becoming more and more painful and i can't tell if i should be making a trip to the ER or not! i honestly think this product should be taken off the market. ladies - PLEASE save yourself the anxiety and go to the drug store...",1,One,B00T0C9XRK
"I love this mascara! It's not so easy to remove. When I say easy, I mean with water. I guess I'm used to makeup that's easy to take off with just water. But you'll need a makeup remover or soap to take it off. But even then, some still stays on. But this mascara really lifts up your lashes. Mine aren't curled. And this mascara keeps them curled until I wash it off. So I say, that's pretty good for me.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Mehhhhhhhhhhhhh I wanted to love it because my favorite beauty YouTuber loves it..... it’s smudgy and clumpy when you put it on, I have to comb it out with a spoolie so I don’t have tarantula lashes. It kind of gets everywhere and it’s not waterproof (or chiropractor visit proof, whenever I leave the chiropractor with this mascara on I look like a raccoon because it smudges so much) probably won’t buy this again",3,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I have always spent $24+ when buying mascara. My go to brands were Milk, Tarte, Benefit etc. I heard about this mascara & figured I’d take a chance bc of the price & I'm so happy I did. It works AMAZING! I honest to god like the results better than the high end brands. The wand is excellent, skinny & tapered so you can spread it nicely without clumping and access the inner corners. Gave me more volume than any brand I’ve ever used and it lasted all day, looked exactly the same at 10 pm as it did in the morning! So happy to have found this",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Cakey.. Made my lashes look like spiders. It flaked onto my face after only a couple of hours. I tried one coat and my lashes actually looked shorter than with other brands and clumpy at the same time. I added a second coat and holy crap.. much worse! I tried to separate them and it just stayed clumpy.. but in all honesty, it was already falling off at that point. I usually use ""it"" mascara or Covergirl and sometimes L.A. colours.. all three of those brands are superior to this brand as far as I am concerned.",1,0,B00T0C9XRK
"It’s like Clumpy waterproof mascara. Yes, it does make your lashes look longer but at the expense of ‘not natural’! It is also difficult to remove and my lower lashes were actually coming off from this product, threw it away.",3,One,B00T0C9XRK
"How is this a best selling mascara when it's not even packaged? Maybe I was just unfortunate, but the mascara came without protective packaging. There was a crappy seal, which consisted of a tiny clear sticker that looked like it had been peeled off and put back on a few times. Plus the bottle itself had some scratches on it. I would never put anything on my lashes that isn't properly sealed. Its unsafe and insanitary.

You're better off paying a little more for something else that's properly sealed.",1,3,B00T0C9XRK
"Considering the price, this is a pretty fantastic mascara and likely my new go-to for long, dramatic lashes. That being said, this is definitely not a swipe-and-go mascara unless you really like clumps. The mascara is thick and clingy and grabs everything including itself, which makes it great for lengthening, but you will want a spoolie brush or a clean, recycled mascara brush to break up the lashes. My process with this mascara is first coat, brush it out, let it dry, second coat, brush it out again. The result is gloriously long lashes. Just not the right choice if you're in a rush.",4,0,B00T0C9XRK
"This mascara goes on terrible! It has uneven texture “fibers” to it that clumps in one place and barely goes on the other lashes. It gets all over lid and under eye until it dries. I spent more time cleaning eyes from using it than I’ve ever spent on any other product. Once it dries, it still smudges but then had to use an oil to remove from lashes. As facial cleanser just left flakes on lashes.",2,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Within 10 minutes of applying, this mascara started to sting/burn my eyes. I took it off right away and it immediately resolved.

I gave it to my mom to try, and she experienced a strange “cooling” feeling (like Vicks) on the eye she put it on.

I had high hopes based on reviews and hoped to find a good cheap mascara, but it isn’t worth messing with your eyes for this.

On top of the strange reactions, neither of us liked the actual mascara. It was clumpy and wet, and didn’t dry in the 10 minutes I had it on.",1,One,B00T0C9XRK
"I was a bit doubtful this mascara would live up to the hype. It was so inexpensive that I figured, ""No way."" I've been using it for a month, and love it. It goes on great and it appears to make my lashes look fuller and longer. The length part may be my imagination but I do think it helps. This is a product I will buy again, and will recommend to others. My daughter will be getting some in her Christmas Stocking this year. Love it.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I have short, very thin lashes and for years believed I would only get best results from a high-end, expensive name brand mascara. After I retired, I wanted to scale down living expenses and found I no longer used makeup on a daily basis, especially mascara. I began to try various popular brands available in super markets and drug stores. I ended up with a drawer full of used-only-a-few-times purchases. Then I saw an ad on Amazon for Lash Princess mascara at an unbelievably low price. Not expecting much, I ordered one. I was absolutely amazed at how well it worked on my aging, thin, colorless lashes. I just reordered 4 more and really hope the company will continue production!!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Ugh....It breaks my heart how long I've been paying 3x as much for amazing mascara. I absolutely....already ordered more..... positively....maybe I'll even order more now.....love this product. My lashes sperate nicely, get fuller, longer looking and my favorite part of it is if I need to reapply the next morning for a quick trip out it doesn't clump, just adds beautifully. Highly recommend.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I had really high hopes for this mascara after seeing it on several different lists for top-rated items on Amazon. However, I am very disappointed. The mascara is super clumpy and definitely does not have the “buildable volume” like I hoped. Now - I will say that, being from the Midwest, I ordered this mascara when temps were likely below zero! I have had issues in the past with makeup not surviving the shipping in sub zero temps! So, whether or not the temperature played a factor is debatable!",2,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I’m very disappointed with this purchase. First, the wand was bent inside the tube. I was able to straighten it mostly. The mascara was very clumpy when I put it on. After a few hours I had black smudges under my eyes and also flaked off mascara on the lenses of my glasses. I’m thankful I only bought 1 tube instead of the multi-pack. It definitely didn’t give me the false eyelash look at all.",1,0,B00T0C9XRK
"False advertising. There's no ""false"" lash effect whatsoever. One of, if not THE worst, mascaras I've ever used. It's what you'd buy your 15 year old daughter.",1,3,B00T0C9XRK
"After reading tons of great reviews, I took my chance on this mascara. I was so excited when it arrived and tried it on immediately. I'm not sure if I just got a dud or what but there's nothing I really like about it. I have fairly long natural lashes, and this mascara just made them sooo clumpy no matter how many times I tried wiping the excess of the brush before applying or combing through with a clean spoolie. It also smudged throughout the day under my eye even though I never once touched my eyes. I also got a stye on my lower lid for the first time in 7+ years, and the only new thing in my life was this mascara. Overall, I paid for a cheap mascara and that's what I received.",3,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I went off reviews as I normally do with everything I purchase on Amazon. This one has the highest reviews of any other mascara so I had to give it a shot, especially at the price I wouldn’t be losing out on much. WOW, JUST, WOW. Best mascara I’ve ever used by a long shot! I will forever stick with this one until it is no longer available or I’m 6 feet under. Incredible! To say the very least!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I cannot say enough about this mascara. I am always in search of a great mascara. I normally have to add several layers and use my eyelash curler a couple of times to make it look like I have some kind of lashes. My lashes are thin and very straight. This mascara does everything that you could want. It makes them look long, adds volume and when you curl the lashes they stay curled. Where has this mascara been. I Found a treasure. As soon as I tried it I sent one to my sister-in-law and one to my niece. I’ve been spreading the word. If you buy it you won’t be disappointed that’s for sure.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
I do like this mascara and I have a hard time finding good mascara. I ordered the duo pack with water proof and regular. I think I prefer the regular formula. I must say the waterproof was easy to remove though which was nice. I wear moisturizer under my eyes so the mascara does blot under my eyes with wear like many others but I don't have naturally long lashes I think this gives me great length and volume. As much as a nine to five false lash does. I will reorder,4,0,B00T0C9XRK
Okay so for the price I thought no way is this product gonna be this high rated - well it’s the bomb you guys. My favorite Instagram influencer Jessica Teague uses this so I decided to go on a limb and purchase it and I’m already planning to order two more. It definitely gives the look of false lashes as well as it does better than my 30 dollar mascara from Tarte. Where has this been my whole life??,5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I’m going to start this out by saying- I do NOT have long, beautiful, lashes naturally and typically rely on falsies for volume. However, with clinic, they are not allowed, so I’ve been on the hunt for a good mascara that would separate my lashes and maybe give them a little more length and volume. I’ve bought the expensive ones from ulta and mac and every place between and they DONT HOLD A CANDLE TO THIS MASCARA! Y’all... the pic included is DAY 2!! My lashes are separate and much longer than usual. I am so in love with the quality and my wallet loved the price. If you’re on the fence, take the leap, sister. This is the bees knees of mascara, better than 4D volume, better than those fiber ones that “stick” to the end of your natural lashes. This is it. Save yourself the research, this is it. I took the leap because of so many high ratings, so hopefully this helps you with your decision too!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I thought I liked it at first and was telling everyone about it. It did make my lashes look longer but it definitely clumps and you have to use a lash comb or tweezers to separate your lashes. After a few days of using it, I noticed little red bumps around and under both of my eyes. I stopped using the product immediately and the bumps cleared up after a couple of days. I tried to return the product and it said it was ""not eligible for return"" so I had to reach out to Amazon directly for my refund. Also, the product did not come sealed shut. I didn't think about it at first because I was so excited to use it.",1,5,B00T0C9XRK
"So I wouldn’t go as far as “fake lashes look” but omg this is as close as you can get for a dupe for Too Faced better than sex mascara!!! So this being a dupe for a $26.00 bucks one tells you something. Will definitely repurchase it. Look at my review picture and trust me my husband has bigger lashes then me , mine are technically non existent! Now the down side, you gotta work to remove this bad boy off.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"This does look good when you put it on your eyelashes, however it transfers all over the place. Within minutes or hours you will have this on your eyelids and underneath your bottom eyelashes even if you didn't apply any at all on your bottom lash. It transfers easily, doesn't matter if you use primer or not. You truly get what you pay for with this. You are better off just buying wet and wild mascara",2,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I really wanted to like this mascara, and I do, kind of. I like the way it goes on, extends my lashes beautifully, but the stuff melts off, and smudges terribly. Definitely not smudge proof, is it supposed to be waterproof?? If so. It's not. It goes on super black. And starts melting pretty quickly, within a few hours. So I have to check my eyes constantly and under bottom lashes I have to Q-tip them. And I don't put mascara on my bottom lashes. So I'm not a fan.",2,One,B00T0C9XRK
"Simply the best! And it’s teenager approved, so that says something. The formula of this mascara is perfection right out of the tube. There is no need to finesse the mascara and the wand to get rid of clumps or excess product. I’ve been using L’Oreal Voluminous for decades but this mascara beats that 100%. It lengthens and thickens perfectly. Remarkable product at a crazy low price point.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
I thought that I loved this product. I started using it in the winter and it worked great. I loved the volume it added to my lashes and it seemed to stay on for most of the day. However once summer rolled around this all changed. I swear it was melting off my lashes. I went out grocery shopping and came home and it looked like I had been crying. It was smudged all around my eye and was off my lashes. I tried it again because I thought maybe this was a fluke or I was rubbing my eyes but nope it did the same thing again that day. So disappointed because it could have been my new go to mascara.,1,One,B00T0C9XRK
"Well, you get what you pay for. I don’t have all morning to build layer after layer to achieve the advertised length. Worst part, after about half a day of wear, I was left with raccoon eyes and black smudge all over my under eye area. Run, don’t walk, away from this product. I’ve bought lots of drugstore brands that perform much better.",1,One,B00T0C9XRK
This product was recommended to me so I thought I’d give it a go! Great price and for about a week and a half I loved it! Great volume and extended lashes! Then it began clumping and I would end up with tarantula lashes. I don’t pump my mascara so it isn’t because of that. I would give it five stars if the product stayed consistent. I will order it again to give it another shot. I mean maybe I got a bad or old one? I surely hope so.,3,One,B00T0C9XRK
"I was really excited to try this mascara after all the phenomenal reviews. Within one hour I left left the house and looked in my car mirror and it looked like I had two black eyes. It was all over the bottom and top and when I tried to wipe it off with my finger in smudged all over looking worse. I tried to fix it but it got worse as the day went on. When I washed my face it would not come off my lashes with warm water and Cetiphil. I tried make up wipes and it helped but wow was I disappointed in this mascara. The volume initially looked great on my lashes but if you want the look of waking up as if you had the walk of shame after leaving a random guys house after a drunken one night stand, then this the mascara for you!",2,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I applied 2 layers of this mascara, and the volume was good but the formula is a little heavy and weighed my lashes down. The mascara flakes off, and if you touch the flakes that are unknowingly on your face, they smear. I would also not recommend this for humid environments. After only a few minutes outside in the fog, it was coming off my lashes and splashing onto my face as I blinked. It's not the easiest to take off, which is also a downside.",2,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I tried this mascara and for the most part it works very well. HOWEVER, it does flake after several hours & most especially if you wear overnight. I use aveeno makeup remover towelettes and this mascara removes very easily. Like most mascaras when they are new, it’s difficult to control the amount of mascara loaded on the wand. It will clump if not careful. I used a different wand to control & separate after using. I NEVER experienced any eye burning, or infections. Yes, I would purchase again. I only wish it came in brown not just black.",4,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I'm new to mascara, and my eyelashes are curly. I've tried a few in the last few months. But I have very sensitive skin. So far this mascara is great. I love the wand the most. It's definitely smudge free. I did have a difficult time getting it off my lashes. Again, I believe it's because I'm new to the whole mascara makeup thing. I would definitely recommend to purchase this item.",4,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I really was so happy with this mascara at first. I love the formula ...it is smooth and goes on beautifully . I got a desired look with one or two applications.
The big downside for me ...and it is not good at all ....is that no matter how careful I am the mascara smudges all too easily.
I carefully make sure all of it is off my undereye before leaving the house ( I only apply mascara to upper lashes but it still gets under my eyes.
I used this mascara for at least a week and noticed that throughout the day it continued to smudge and get in places it should not be. I do not rub my eyes or do anything to cause this.
I wish they could somehow fix this issue as it is a good mascara if it did not smudge so badly.",3,0,B00T0C9XRK
As most I am constantly searching for the best mascara for volume. Cruelty free etc. I always judge by first application. This one? Instant length. Builds beautifully.So far this is an absolute winner. The price is so great buy as many as you can. Very pleasantly surprised. This mascara is better than very expensive mascara in my opinion. INstant impressive results. Love it. Enjoy!,5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I like almost everything about this mascara. It goes on smoothly, and doesn’t take much effort to separate the lashes. It doesn’t flake, harden, or make the lashes feel dry. It also washes off pretty easily. The only problem I have is it transfers from the tips of my curled lashes onto the top of my hooded lids. My eyelids tend to become oily quickly as well, so I can’t exactly blame the mascara.",4,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I wanted so badly to love this mascara. The reviews are amazing and the price is great, but I didn’t love it. The Wanda’s so full of product that it is hard to apply without getting too much mascara clumped into lashes. I tried wiping some of the product off of the wand but it didn’t help enough. It seems like the wand doesn’t comb the product through my lashes but just clumps it on there.",3,0,B00T0C9XRK
"This mascara looks great when you first put it on. It’s buildable , no flakes, looks good with only one or two coats BUT every time I wear this it smudges under my eyes and creates very dramatic dark zombie / raccoon eyes. I’ve tried it with several different concealers, powder under the eyes, no powder. Who matter what it always smudges. It’s difficult to wash off with just normal face wash too. It’s great for cheap mascara but I Will not be buying again. I’d rather pay $5 more and get a slightly better mascara.",2,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Ladies! After seeing this had over 10 thousand reviews, I had to try it. Bought two, one for my mom and one for myself. It’s everything that I’ve always wanted!!!!

I’m never ever going back to what I used to wear!!!!!!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"This stuff is fantastic at making my eyelashes look long and full. It stays on great, almost too well! I have a hard time getting it off using make-up remover wipes. It will come off, but I found once it was off my eyelashes, I also had to work a little to get it off of my skin. I think a make-up remover cream is best to get it off. But, other than that, I really do like the product.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"You can not use this mascara straight out of the tube. It's too wet, too clumpy for that. Your lashes will be stuck together looking all spidery and take forever to dry. But if you scrape the excess off every side of the wand (trust me there will be A LOT of excess mascara) and are willing to take the time to separate your lashes afterward, you might be willing to keep this $5 mascara. I will admit, the length and fullness it gives you (after you do what I said) ain't bad. But it's a lot of extra work for a $5, super wet, clumpy mascara.",3,0,B00T0C9XRK

I’ve always purchased super expensive máscaras that take tons of applications to work. I found this on a Facebook Amazon finds and decided to try it. Wow!!! I literally get a dramatic look with two applications. My lashes are very blonde and not long or full. This mascara is perfect. It doesn’t smudge after an entire day. It also washes off completely whereas most others need a good wipe even after a shower. I’m replacing all of my high end mascaras with this. Never spending $50 on mascara again.,5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"listen im a mascara junkie I have it everywhere its an obsession. this mascara is amazing one of my favorites only issue is its smudges like a house being sage'd I will no give it up so I use this as my base mascara, then YSL Shock next and finally Man Eater by UD bc the brush Is comb like to separate the lashes. my lashes look amazing all day and night this way. I tell everyone about this secret gem!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"STOP YOUR SEARCH! I was a religious user of Better Than Sex, and it worked perfectly for me for 7 years. Then I read some reviews of this and decided to try it out. Not only was this a much cheaper option, it offered more volume, length, and thickness. I get compliments on my eyelashes all the time. My first bottle lasted me over 4 months using it everyday. A tube of better than sex was lucky to last me 2 months. It comes off easily with any makeup remover or wipe.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Overall I am very pleased with this mascara. I have very blonde, fine and straight lashes. Things I love about it.... It’s super black and actually does great at volumizing so I get a fuller look at my lash line, also really does lengthen my lashes and keeps them curled pretty well (my lashes are very stubbornly straight so that’s hard to do). Some things I didn’t love... At first it was hard to get used to applying it because I’ve always used mascaras that need 2 coats to really cover and lengthen, but this one has a lot of product on the brush so one coat is plenty. In fact I have to be careful to not mess with them much at all or it’ll get clumpy and my lashes stick together, but with one quick coat wiggled from root to tips it comes out fantastic. I don’t think it’s waterproof but it does take makeup remover to fully get it off. It’s been 2 weeks and still hasn’t gotten dry or clumpy yet so we’ll see how long a tube lasts. Overall for $5 It’s a great mascara!",4,0,B00T0C9XRK
I’m not quite sure how there are so many great reviews. I found this mascara far inferior to other drugstore brands. It goes on pretty clumpy and is really crumbly once dry (like you end up with a lot of black dots on your face that need to be dealt with). I will admit I haven’t tried the waterproof one yet. I am really just disappointed in light of the reviews but it was pretty cheap so I guess I got what I paid for. I’ll just buy L’Oréal again next time.,3,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I ordered this product based on the price and the reviews. I was super excited. It gave me beautiful thick eyelashes that lasted all day with no smudging. Unfortunately, it also gave me a rash. I must be allergic to something in the formula. I got a red, bumpy rash on my eyelid along the base of my lashes. It itched like the devil. It cleared up within a couple days once I stopped using the product. I waited a week and I tried again because I've never had an issue like this before and thought it was just pollen allergies or something. I had the same rash appear again. I switched back to my old brand and haven't had a problem since. It seems to be a good product if you can use it.",3,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Love this stuff! I hate mascara so I haven't worn it in like a year because the stuff always irritated me with either feeling like I had something in my eye, an eyelash feeling like it needed to be ""pulled"" clumping etc. So I gave up on it for a long time until I found this stuff. Another reviewer suggested using L'Oreal Paris Makeup Voluminous Lash Boosting Conditioning Primer Mascara first so I did and omygerd yassss. I look like I'm wearing freaking false eyelashes that look natural without any clumps and I actually forget im wearing this stuff its so soft and ""forgettable"" MUST BUY",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I had this expectation that it would make my lashes look longer like I've seen some false lash effect mascara's claim to do. I can't tell the difference with this and a typical mascara. In fact it dries REALLY fast sometimes causing it to clump. You have to have it applied withing a minute or so or it starts to look thick and clumpy if you keep adding to it. Doesn't give the look of LONGER lashes, but fuller. Which typical mascara does. Not sure if I would call it false-advertising.. Maybe I misinterpreted the description. I appreciate that its cruelty free!!",3,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Not saying it gave me an eye infection, but I didn’t have an eye infection before I started using this.... just saying. Maybe I’m allergic, maybe it an infection, but my eyelids swelled and crusted (sorry, gross, I know). As far as it’s application and overall look — I have short lashes so it didn’t do much for me. My lashes tend to stick together with this mascara too. I like that it’s super dark, but overall it didn’t do enough for me to like it.",3,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Yup, this stuff is amazeballs! It is a lot drier then what I normally use (Maybelline The Falsies PushUp or if I can't find that Maybelline Colossal Volume Express) but it does the job!! And it's a couple of bucks cheaper. Also, for the other reviews that asked if it came sealed in plastic - yes mine did. I *may* buy another tube and see if putting a couple drops of contact lens solution in it makes it a bit creamier but even as is the stuff is really awesome! I've used a few pricey mascaras by Benefit in the past but this stuff is even better at a fraction of the price. Also, I got the regular formula, not waterproof, even though I NEVER buy non-waterproof eye mascara and this stuff sticks like a mf! No need to buy the waterproof stuff.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"With just a single sweep or two, this made my lashes very long and thick looking. At 53 years old, I've never used a mascara that gave such a dramatic effect with so little work. I'd been using false lashes, but this works so well, I'll save the falsies for special occasions. It stays in place and doesn't smudge all day, even when it's warm out. I've already recommended it to my friends and they love it, too.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"This stuff was recommended to me by a moms fb group, it’s the best and the price is amazing! It layers well so if you like to wear more vs less- it’s perfect; but you don’t have to - one coat works great! My photo is just with one coat on!

Washes off easily without having to use an oil based makeup remover!
Buy it- you won’t be sorry!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
Not water proof at all. Will get on your face. But it will make your lashes look for but only for about a hour then it’s in your eyes and on your face. Easy to remove because it removes itself within a hour or so. I’ll will look for better.,1,2,B00T0C9XRK
"Update:
This mascara is amazing. I’ve been using it for several months now and can’t think of 1 bad thing. I was amazed on how I went to the beach, into the water for a couple of hours and it did not run one bit. I would dive into the water and when I would come back out i would be cleaning under my eyes thinking the mascara was running everywhere, but there was absolutely nothing under my eyes. It’s truly such a great mascara and you can’t beat the price.
This is such a good mascara. My eyelashes look great when I wear it. I have no problem taking it off and it doesn't flake.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
I really wanted to like this but the mascara is very clumpy. It just globs on so thick and leaves your lashes completely saturated and stuck together. I have to use my old mascara wand to comb through afterward in order to make this usable. I would’ve just returned it but I really needed mascara and it’s harder to get deliveries during the covid pandemic so I’m just gonna stick it out. But I won’t purchase again unfortunately.,1,0,B00T0C9XRK
Wanted to like this but it smudges like crazy. It does create great length but you end up with raccoon eyes. I set my undereye with my usual setting powder and still had smudging within hours. I use Loreal Lash Paradise and do not get smudges with that product.,1,One,B00T0C9XRK
"I bought this mascara after reading a review on another website. It showed a dramatic change in the length and volume of the lashes. I wouldn’t say that this mascara is any better than others I’ve tried. It is smudge proof, but I didn’t see an increase in length like the other photos I saw. It was worth the money I paid for it though and overall was a good mascara. I just didn’t see the effect I was looking for however.",4,0,B00T0C9XRK
"For the most part this is a great mascara. Especially for the price. I LOVE the applicator brush, the color is great. No clumping. Builds well for more dramatic looks. It doesn’t irritate my sensitive eyes, or flake off into my contacts. It looks beautiful. It comes off easily with make-up remover or soap. The only down side is that it does occasionally smudge. Especially along my brow bone. In the end, I would still buy it again, and recommend it.",4,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Ok so my daughter is a makeup artist and is really amazing. With that comes a ton of products that she gives me to try. Lately she gave me all kinds of new on the market mascaras. But I saw this adorable mascara packaging when I was reviewing what my daughter had given me, so I got it. I will never use another mascara again. It curls, lengthens, separates, doesn’t smudge, at all. Stays soft and removes pretty easily, an oil remover seems to work perfectly.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"The first time wearing this mascara I was very pleased. The second time I tried to use it the ring inside the tube that wipes off the excess product failed and it went on very gloopy. I tried wiping the wand on the lip of the tube but it didn't help.
I don't know if I want to try another tube because if the same thing happens I will be upset about wasting my money",3,0,B00T0C9XRK
"This is such a great mascara, that I bought more for myself and my daughters. My lashes are growing back and this mascara really brought out each lash and thickened and lengthened them like no other mascara has. I was really surprised. It's now my go to. The bottle has also stayed nice and wet after a while and not dried up at all. There's a reason why there are so many positive reviews. It works and the price is really low.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
BEST mascara ever!!!! I have used L’Oréal waterproof mascaras for years but once I hit 56 I noticed my lashes were not as full nor long so I decided to try Princess mascara & all I can say is WOW!!!!! I wasn’t sure if I’d like it bc it isn’t waterproof but don’t hesitate if you have this mascara in your cart BUY IT!!!! My lashes are fuller and longer than I even imagined!!!! Even my husband noticed and we’ve been married for 21 years!!!!,5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Ordered this with much expectation that it would length and volume to my lashes! Mush more than other mascara products I have used. This was based upon the product claims and reviews. BUT, it is no more than any other cheap mascara. It is very liquid, does not add anything but color to lashes and takes awhile to dry. I was very disappointed! It's left me wondering if all the 5 star ratings are from genuine customers or if we are talking about the same product!.",2,0,B00T0C9XRK
"For four dollars, this is a mighty fine mascara. Is it the holy grail that everyone says it is? I don’t think so personally. The formula is thick, and while it gives great volume it also clumps my lashes together something fierce. I know some people like that look, but I prefer more defined lashes. I’ll use the rest of the tube, but I probably wouldn’t repurchase.",4,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I got the tube with the green. I’ve used this mascara a handful of times. I LOVE how it looks and applies; however, it takes forever to dry and smudges on my lids just below my brows quite a bit. It’s definitely noticeable. I’m not certain if the smudging is before or after it “dries”, because I don’t notice it until a few hours into my day. Which is a bit embarrassing. It doesn’t clump at all, since it’s a wetter formula. I’ll work with it a few more times, because I do love the look and application. It’s lengthening, volumizing, and very buildable.",3,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Bought this mascara because of the hype and price. For me, it is alright, it flakes and there is nothing worst than finding little black flakes on your face. I don’t have thick lashes so it doesn’t seem to spread easily and seems to clump. That was my experience with this mascara. I’ll stick with CoverGirl, thank you! Wondering, if anyone else had this experience?",3,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I purchased this mascara for my daughter and myself. Overall, this mascara is value priced at $5 (good for a teenager to carry daily and okay if lost) and does a decent job lengthening. It is lightweight and doesn’t smudge easily, but is easy to remove with soap and water. I like that is doesn’t cake up your lashes, but that being said this mascara does not thicken lashes well or at all. I normally wear L’Oréal and I will say L’Oréal mascara is better for thickness and length.",4,0,B00T0C9XRK
I’ve only ever worn department store brand mascara until reading a review on Lash Princess. For the price I figured why not give it a try! I’m in LOVE! I can get 3 tubes for the price of what I use to pay for 1! It goes on smooth and I’ve Had NO clumping issues. It stays on all day without smudges. I won’t ever pay those ridiculous department store prices again!,5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I bought this because of other great reviews and it definitely held up. I was nervous of the price at first considering this is cheaper than any mascara I have ever bought that was worth anything, but seriously, the volume is noticeable. This mascara is great and I will be buying again. Most mascaras I use mess up so easily because I swear I have allergies almost year round. If you're hesitant, don't be, this mascara is great and you cannot beat the price.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I never write reviews, but I just received this today & was excited to try it . I seriously couldn't believe how awesome it works!!!! I have never been one for false lashes/extensions or the ""spider look"" fiber mascara. THIS product lays on easily, looks super natural & is very reasonably priced (cheaper than most drugstore brands)! I can't attest to it's lasting wear, etc, as I just put it on 5 minutes ago, but 2 light coats (on one eye) & I am blown away with my 1st impression. Yay!! I LOVE it!!!",5,2,B00T0C9XRK
"I do like the length it gives my lashes, that's the only thing I like. It smudges very easily and when I use the bathroom I can always count on seeing it under my eyes ever single time! It's also very hard to get off. I will not purchase this again. Seems like maybelline will always be my cheap mascara go to atleast that never smudges!",2,One,B00T0C9XRK
"I had high hopes for this mascara. I love the bottle and it goes on nicely, but it doesn't stay on well. After only a couple of hours or less I always have black smudge under my eyes. Thankfully I've only worn this around the house and just do normal every day activities. Nothing that should be making it smudge so badly.",2,One,B00T0C9XRK
"For a $5 mascara this stuff is great! I don't see it lasting long, it has a drier consistency and will probably dry out faster but it went on smoothly and does beef up the lashes. I tried both Volumizing and False Effect and they pretty much look the same. I did have to run my eyelash comb thru the ends to rid that clumpy eyelash look that I don't like. It's all in the application. Buy it!",4,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Boom! I found it! My go to mascara. Who needs anything else? It's very reasonably priced, accentuates the lashes perfectly. This stuff goes on easy, adds beautiful length, and looks great. I feel just as confident with this as with any fiber mascara...
The wear is great. No clumps, flaking, or fatigue. I have worked out in it several times after work and it stayed put. With that being said, it is still easy to wash off with soap or I woukd imagine makeup remover. The previous mascara I tried was pulling my lashes out with the wash. I am one happy gal. I'll add a picture soon.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I almost never write reviews but wanted to for this product. I've used this tube of mascara for the past 6 months. It makes your lashes look great especially for the price. However, my experience is that the formula is too wet and always transferred underneath my lower lash line. At first I thought this could be fixed by powdering under the eye or letting my sunscreen dry more before applying mascara. However, the issue persisted. As such, I do not recommend this mascara unless you somehow find a solution to the under eye transferring issue!",4,One,B00T0C9XRK
"Very nice. Color is dark and consistent. Easy application, will smudge. Was hesitant in purchase. Had great reviews for the price. Was doubtful upon opening. Looks childish, and applicator is very small. I didn't use my eye lash curler. Was quite surprised with the effects. Disappointed with the texture and the fact that it smudges. Nice factor is that it does false lash extension.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I have tried every mascara there is from drugstores, sephora, Macy's, etc. This is the BEST mascara by far !!! Adds volume , length, lift and is 5.00 !!!!!

"I am a bit of a snob when it comes to my makeup, especially where my mascara is concerned. While I will love the expensive mascara that I had been using for years forever, this Lash Princess mascara is AMAZING! It really does make you look like you’re wearing falsies! I do occasionally need to wipe under my eyes at the end of a long day to remove some smudging, but the waterproof version (blue) is definitely smudge proof. It’s easy to remove with a makeup wipe, or with some good old fashioned soap and water, and I couldn’t be happier with my purchase. I wear mascara every day and take pride in my long lashes and the first day I switched, I received compliments on how voluminous my lashes were. Definitely a fan!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Really nice mascara for the price. Need to use an eye makeup remover to keep from looking like a raccoon when removing it. I prefer the kind I can just use my face wash to take off. This is hard to get off, rough on the delicate skin around the eyes. The mascara does look really good on, and thickens and extends my lashes, but not for sure if I will buy again.",4,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I only gave 4 stars because I read a lot of reviews that said this mascara doesn't clump up but it did on me immediately within the first couple of strokes on my eyelashes. I have to clean up the clumps after applying. It does work well though and make my eyelashes appear a lot longer and thicker. It stays in place all day and is very easy to remove. So overall it's good for the price, just be prepared to clean it up a little bit after applying.",4,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I have used every expensive mascara brand from Yves St Laurent, Guerlain, Lancome and everything in between. I have straight, fine lashes, and every mascara would uncurl them. The mascara would either coat the lashes too much, or be too thick on the ends. I literally NEVER found mascara I loved - at any price - until I read about this mascara on Facebook. I ordered it, thinking, at that price what have I got to lose? OMG, it didn't uncurl my lashes, it went on like a dream and made my lashes fuller and longer than I ever dreamed. This mascara is wonderful! THANK YOU!!!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"With my recent mascara being discontinued I figured I'd give this product a shot. I really like the length the mascara provides but the product comes off kind of glopy and causes my lashes to clump (I like more natural looking lashes). You definitely need a decent eyelash comb to fix this issue. My other hesitation with this product is that I think I get it all off with my makeup remover wipes but as soon as I get out of the shower, I have racoons eyes. That's not a huge deal besides that I need to use another wipe; just more inconvenient than anything else. Otherwise, the product does fulfill what I want overall. Not sure that I'd buy it again but will continue to use it while I find a more permanent option.",3,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I always felt like mascaras never worked for me. The reviews on this were so great that i figured I would give it a try. This one really does make my lashes look longer! It’s so much easier to apply mascara when I don’t feel like wearing/applying lash strips. The price is great. I do wish it was waterproof, then it would literally be perfect, however I still 100% recommend.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"For $5 this mascara is amazing, I prefer it over Better Than Sex which is close to $30. It’s tougher to wash over with just a cleanser, but easily comes off with the garnier micellar water. It gives great volume. I don’t notice any flaking. It doesn’t run MUCH. It can run but easily swiped off if it ever does, if you’re out sweating then it might. It’s honestly one of my favorite mascaras and yet to find one better.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I absolutely LOVE this mascara!! In fact, I just bought it for the first time, and I loved it so much that I ordered three more right away. I included two pictures. One is with two coats on both lashes. The other picture has one eye bare and the other eye has a single coat, so you can get an idea of what you would be working with.
Overall...great mascara!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"The first two weeks of using this mascara, are amazing. After the mascara had a little age on it, I noticed my eyelashes started getting that spider legs look, and the mascara was flaking by the end of the day. Not sure why this happened. I will say again it was great in the beginning and it would be perfect if you’re using it for a photo shoot or an event. I did leave one star off because it should’ve at least lasted for more than a month",4,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I seen a YouTuber recommended this Lash Princess mascara so I was shocked when I looked it up and it was so cheap!! I love the container, so feminine! It works BETTER than any mascara I've tried and I'm 42 so I've tried a few. It even works better than those high dollar ones that have the fibers or 2 step process with fiber to build up your lashes. A few swipes of this and your lashes are thick and long",5,0,B00T0C9XRK

"I bought this mascara because I read a great review in a place that I really trust. Well. Not so much. It clumps from the first swipe. I spend all my time trying to comb out the clumps. By the time I’m done, I have these overly done lashes that look like I put a new coat over last nights unwashed lashes. Also, the brush is awful. I like to see the bristles. These are too short and I believe that’s why there is so much clumping.",2,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I am so disappointed with this. I tried it because I had heard such good things and for the price, I had nothing to lose. It looks beautiful on my lashes and at first I thought that it was exactly what I was looking for. Sadly, it transfers like crazy on me. I really wanted to love it, so I tried it several times with different setting sprays, but none of it helped and I had to throw it out. If you don’t want dark smudges below your eyes, avoid this mascara.",2,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Es bueno las deja largas, aunque pesadas tienes que enchinar las pestañas nuevamente después de aplicarlo porque se van bajando por el producto.

So came across this $4.99 mascara on a Top Reviews List Items in Amazon and decide to try it. Oh my GOD! I still can’t believe how good this is for the price.

"I have very sparse, short lashes. I have tried dozens of mascaras and this one does give me the most length and volume. The only detrractor is that it does clump up, especially if you try putting on multiple coats. I found that if I used a spoolie on my lashes before it dried and then waited until they were dry to add another coat, that my lashes didn't clump as bad. but for the money, this one is far superior than any other mascara under $20.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK

Quick, simple, takes no effort to have full effect. Recommend to anyone interested in cosmetics",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I wanted to like this- it was hyped up so much and yes, it adds length and volume. The downside is, this smudges faster than a candy bar in a hot car. God forbid if you cry with this on.

Look, it’s a great mascara, but this wasn’t for me.",3,One,B00T0C9XRK
I have been looking for a good mascara like this for YEARS! I heard about this from Bailey Sarian (one of the only trustworthy -and very talented- beuty YouTubers out there) and I am in LOVE! This is hands down the best 'true mascara' on the market. The ONLY thing I like a bit better is the Thrive mascara which is 'liquid false lashes' but it has a strange consistency and comes off in a weird way too... if you are looking for a really good MASCARA this is a no brainer. I can't believe the great price as well... I would still consider it the nest if it was $30 a tube (I might not pay that much because I am cheap lol) but yes definitely a great buy and another AMAZING find from Bailey!,5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"For the price it was an alright mascara. I love beauty on a budget products but I didn’t notice a significant difference to my lashes.
Maybe you have to have thin long lashes to see any major difference, but for me it just came out kinda clumpy. I do have very thick, short natural lashes, so if that’s you as well I recommend just skipping this one.",2,0,B00T0C9XRK
"It might be my bad for not getting the waterproof, but this stuff smudges and ends up giving you raccoon eyes within a few hours. ON ANOTHER NOTE: this stuff is the bomb when it comes to length and making lashes look like they are a million bucks. Just sucks that it smudges so easily.",4,One,B00T0C9XRK
"This is a great mascara for the price! The wand is my favorite part of the product, it reminds me of bad girl bang and IT mascaras wands, (skinny to fat) which makes it easy to get each lash! It’s very black and makes my lashes appear long and full!! It applies without clumping or flakes.

The only negative I would have to say is that it’s difficult to remove, I definitely have to use eye makeup remover each time!",4,0,B00T0C9XRK
They are voluminous with this but it's messy I have to put liquid eyeliner on with to help blend in what already looks like liquid eyeliner just incomplete from the initial application of it.

I mean it also smudged a little but that could've been my dumb butt not waiting for it to dry.
All in all, it's got a very pretty effect..one that would look better on someone else. It's just not the lash effect I'm looking for.",3,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I LOVE the idea of cruelty-free cosmetics and always want to support any company that is cruelty-free, but this mascara needs to be rebooted.

As far as water resistance… I am not a fan of waterproof mascara, so I would say that this particular mascara is not waterproof, it will wash off easily. I don’t know if they have a waterproof version, they probably do.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK

So far, this is my favorite and for less than $5 it’s a win! It shares many of the characteristics with the Lancôme for FAR less.

These increase length quite a bit for the price however if you rub your eye it crumbles and gets all over and by the end of the day they tend to be almost gone.

It can be more natural if you want it to be, but it’s very easy to build up as well. You are really able to get the bottom lashes with the brush too. If any of you reading this have ever tried MAC zoomlash mascara, it’s comparable but more separating. If I really want a false lash look, I’ll use a mascara primer under it.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK

"This is the one. It's cheaper than off the shelf mascara from the drug store so I was leery. It really does make your lashes look great. I have skimpy lashes and this product fries quickly so I can put a second coat on and it looks great. For 5 bucks, I can't recommend it enough. I'm ordering extra and keeping it sealed just in case I can't get it again.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"This stuff is magic. I have tried a lot of mascaras in my 30- something years. A LOT. I've always gravitated back to Loreal's 2 step lengthening mascaras. They look okay but I hate fussing to cover the white first step and applying 4 coats. This mascara is amazing. One coat and my lashes look great, two coats and they look better than false lashes. I am a lifetime customer!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I was super skeptical, at first; due to the price. BUT!
As far as smudge-proof goes, it holds up great, but is easy to take off once you use makeup remover. I LOVE the way my lashes look after applying! They aren’t clumped up like other mascaras around this price range.

I’m definitely going to be buying this from now on.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
Works very well for long pretty lashes. It’s kind of difficult to remove for me; I don’t like rubbing my lashes so much. It tends to smear and crumble under my eyes which is not okay for me. From reading the reviews it doesn’t do this to everyone so for the money it’s 100% worth a try because you will have pretty and long lashes with this mascara and maybe no smearing at all.,3,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I had my doubts about mascara this cheap, but let me tell you it lived up to the hype lol. I'm impressed. Just as good as the $9 brand I bought last. This photo is 5pm, after a day with toddlers...not a fresh application. And it holds up well! When first applied my lashes look full and lengthened. Great product very happy. Will buy again. Try it! What do you have to lose?",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
I tried this mascara because an amazon influencer I follow RAVES about it and I loved that it was inexpensive. This mascara is terrible though! My biggest complaint is that it gives you raccoon eyes after only a few hours of wearing. When you put it on it goes on great and looks great but it doesn’t stay that way. Additionally my eyes were getting very itchy and irritated while wearing it. I thought it was a problem with my contacts until I stopped using the mascara and had no more issues.,1,0,B00T0C9XRK
"It gives great volume and can make your lashes look great . However, it smudges like crazy, gives you that “spider legs” effect.
I have naturally long and curly lashes, but they are blonde. These made them long and voluminous, but to the point that I had smudges from my lid to eyebrows, and underneath as well. Even while using primer, setting powder, setting spray, etc.
Not satisfied, although I like the brand, would need to try waterproof",2,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I ordered these because people rave about this mascara. I don't get it...I guess maybe for the price it is a pretty good option but it did not add any sort of length to my eyelashes really. I much prefer other brands from Sephora or Thrive that are worth the extra money. However, if you don't want to spend a bunch of money I guess this is a reasonable option.",3,0,B00T0C9XRK
"For $5 this mascara is a serious winner. I read other reviews that said their mascara didn’t come with a plastic wrap to prove it was unused which made me nervous and honestly if mine had come without the plastic I would have returned it because I don’t trust anyone or anything. Mine did come shrink-wrapped though so I felt okay about using it knowing that it had been unopened before.

I wasn’t expecting much but for $5 figured it was worth a try. A couple days ago I went to have my eyebrows waxed and my go-to lady at first looked offended when I came in because she thought I had lash tinting and extensions done somewhere else (I’ve never had them done, ever). I told her it was my mascara and she looked super surprised and was raving about how natural they looked.....that basically sealed the deal on this 5 star review for me. Will definitely buy again!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I've been using this mascara for about a month now. I love everything about it. It takes maybe 2 coats to achieve the full, voluminous look I love. Other mascaras (even high end ones) takes several coats to achieve that look. Throughout the day it doesn't budge. I don't get those fallen flakes. It is quite difficult for me to remove with just water and my face wash, I do go in with a cleansing oil prior to washing my face when wearing this.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
I really like the price point and the way the product makes my lashes look. I use a curler to but with both this mascara and my curler my lashes look so good. My new favorite mascara. Just because it's cheap don't let it fool you this mascara is just as good if not better than some high-end makeup lines. I would recommend and will keep buying.,5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"This is the most lengthening mascara I've ever owned, except for the 'They're Real' mini I recently tossed out. Really good for the price, and there's an obvious difference when I wear it. I don't use it on days that I'm doing for a more natural look since a couple of coats can make it look a little clumped and dark. I definitely advise not to get your face wet, even just scrunching your face too much can leave residue above and below your eyes depending on how much you apply. But all in all, easily a very good mascara for the price point, just wish it were waterproof.",4,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Oh my god!! There has to be goddess with beautiful lashes trapped in this bottle that transformed my lashes to having thick dark voluminous lashes that DO NOT clump or smudge. Now, I feel like a idiot having spent over $20 or $30 on expensive mascaras but never again!! To be fair!!! I have long curled lashes naturally so I can use literally one pump on both eyes and I’ve beautiful spider legs without the clump or the mess. Another thing, it’s so easy to remove with wipes or face wash without it irritating your eyes or leaving black traces all over your face.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
This is by far my favorite mascara! The price is unbeatable at $4.99 a tube. I like that it is easy to wash off at the end of the day. I dont want to feel like I am scrubbing my eyelashes off every night. This mascara also adds a ton of length to my lashes (as pictured)! I get compliments almost every day. The only downside is that this mascara tends to leave black flakes under the eye every now and then. I dont wear any face makeup and prefer to keep my face clear and moisturized throughout the day which helps and makes it easy for my to wipe underneath my eyes with a premoisturized face cloth and get rid of the flakes throughout the day.,5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"After reading the reviews I was excited to try this product. It stays on all day and does lengthen my lashes while only crumbling near the end of the day. Unfortunately, as others have stated, there is SO much product on the wand when you first pull it out so you have to scrape lots of it off before you can use it. Even doing that there was still too much on it for me so I had to swipe over my application with a lengthening wand from another brush to keep it from clumping. After having used it for a while the wand is almost to the point where I can use it solo and not have to go over my lashes with another wand. If the wand was better this would be a 5 star product, especially at $4.99! I also loved the rubber grips on the wand! Suoer helpful!",3,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Great for a cheap mascara. Can smudge a little but less than some other well-known brands I’ve used (I also have really long lower lashes so I have this problem a lot). Easy to remove considering its mascara, haha, and good for layering. Works great for making your lashes long but not as ideal if you’re going for a super natural vibe.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I have normal length eyelashes but they do not like to curl. I tried this hoping it would give me some volume/curl and it was...okay?

I really like the wand, and the mascara is a little watery but it makes it easier to put multiple coats on. It does make your lashes look longer, but even after using an eyelash curler before applying & after the mascara dried....my lashes were still not keeping a curl for more than 10 minutes.",3,0,B00T0C9XRK
I love this mascara. It goes onto my lashes and stays. The brush is the right shape and size to work on my short stubby eyelashes. So far so good. There were complaints from others that it didn't stay on but I didn't have that experience. It went on and stayed on until I took it off and then it came off like any other mascara.,5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I used Lancome Mascara for a long time. I saw this mascara advertised on the news, who were featuring best products. I won't be buying Lancome again at over 20 dollars. This mascara goes on easily, has a nice long wand and gives great coverage. I also tried the waterproof and the application is wonderful. I purchased three more.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"This mascara is awful! It weighed down my eyelashes even after I curled them and it took forever to dry, which meant anytime I blinked for a good 5-10 minutes, mascara got all over the skin around my eyes. It’s just a gloopy, gobby mess and I threw it away after only using it twice.",1,One,B00T0C9XRK
"This is literally the worst mascara I have ever used. It always makes your lashes look like spider legs, always smudges, always flakes off. I have a problem with straight lashes so I’m forever looking for a good curling mascara bc none of the usual high end brands do any substantial curling. Don’t even waste your time. Keep going.",1,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I purchased 3 of these for myself and my daughters based off the reviews. I was excited to try it but ultimately was disappointed. It is very clumpy (not just my vial but the others as well). Each time we use it, we have to scrape off the excess and blot it on a towel. If we didn’t, we’d have huge clumps and lashes sticking together. I would not recommend this product.",3,One,B00T0C9XRK
I bought this mascara because of a recommendation on one of those “best products on Amazon” lists. I’m happy to say that it did not disappoint! I like how easy it is to build this product up. I can get an everyday look or dramatic lashes depending on the number of coats and technique of application. I usually wear very little make up and I’m not good about removing it. This mascara does require actual washing off. Overall I’m very happy with it and will try other products from this line.,5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I have been looking for a new mascara for a while now, and have tried several recently that just didn't work well. This is the best mascara I have tried in a long time!! Holds all day, easy to apply, and gives such nice definition and length. says on all day without flaking. I will be trying the other versions of this as well. This is my new go-to mascara!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Holy Eyelashes ladies!
Oh my gosh! This mascara is the truth! I love mascara and have tried many price ranges from cheap drugstore to high end mascara and have had very mixed feelings on a lot of them. This mascara though, is my new favorite! I love how it goes on, I love how affordable it is, I love how dramatic it makes my eyes look! Honestly! Buy it! You won’t be disappointed!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"This mascara was recommended to me, but I had little faith in a product so inexpensive. I had tried the high end brands with so-so results, and was pleasantly surprised by the performance of this mascara. My eyelashes look longer and thicker, and the look lasts all day. I don’t find it to smudge easily, and removes without a trace.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
I like this mascara because it definitely gives length to my otherwise unseen lashes. I have trouble finding mascara I like. My only gripe is by the end of the day it does become flakey and needs comes off.,4,2,B00T0C9XRK
Wanted to see what all the hype was about. It was only 5 bucks and came fast. I used it becore work this mormimg and sooo much mascara was on the brush I had to wipe off on the applicator before I could even use it. Went on super thick and clumpy didnt make my lashes look any longer but actually shorter than what i usually wear spending 8 bucks. Umhappy about his lurchase will not use again and dont even know what to do with it besides trash. I would not recommend.,1,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Updated review: I've tried to love this mascara but just can't. It looks like I've been crying after just a few hours. Definitely not my eyeliner since I wear the same Kat Von D eyeliner every day. I wish I could like it more since the price is so good BUT even a cheap discount mascara works better than this one.

It clumps some and smudges by end of day but much better than other mascaras in its price range!",2,0,B00T0C9XRK
"You get what you pay for...I bought this based on all the good reviews, and was vastly disappointed. This stuff clumps worse than the cheapest dollar store mascara. Within an hour it's leaving dark circles under my eyes even when I've had to smudge half of it off because it leaves huge chunks on my lashes. Awful, waste of money.",1,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Overall love this mascara and what it does with my lashes. However, I always have a line right above my eyelashes that looks like eyeliner (but I have no eyeliner on). It’s so weird. This is the only mascara that leaves that thin black line on my top eyelid. I think it’s just me, but the mascara on my lashes, 100% loveeeee it!",4,0,B00T0C9XRK
As I get older (I'm 49) my lashes have gotten so sparse. They are also fading in color. I've tried many different mascaras & I just discovered this one and it's hands down the best one! I do not want to wear false lashes; when you get to my age you want very little time in front of a mirror but this mascara really DOES give you that false lashes look. I hope they don't decide to discontinue now that I've finally found my go-to mascara!!,5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Amazing mascara for the price. As you can see it appears that I have no lashes at all in top pic, bottom is this mascara. It really looks like natural falsies for real. After several hours it can smudge a tad bit. I'm sure setting spray would prevent that, other than that I give it 5stars! Will buy again. Comes off easy also with my oil of olay make up wipes. Lashes also feel soft not hard or flaky.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I'm rating this pretty high since I know multiple people that use it and love it. It didn't last quite as long as my more expensive brands, but it looked great (and only took a few seconds for a touch up after work). Unfortunately, my eyes were too sensitive to use it. I wore it several times before figuring out it made my eyes water and slightly uncomfortable. I like it enough to give the extra one I ordered away to my mom though! For the price, it's definitely worth trying.",4,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Probably the worst tube of mascara I have ever tried. Read some of the reviews and thought why not try. If you like a mascara that is a one application of dry clumps- give it a try. It was dry, did not hold the curl of my lashes, and clumped like 4 days of mascara. I thought I was being harsh in my judgement and tried it a second day. It was worse as it was as if the mascara was even drier than the previous day. Save your money!",1,0,B00T0C9XRK
"This mascara left so much black flakes below my eyes towards the end of the day. It also constantly left little black dots on my eye lids despite the mascara having dried for several hours. I would walk into the bathroom just to see blacks marks on my eyelids. I was really hopeful because of a website that reviewed this as being an amazing mascara. In the end, it smudged, flaked, and is in the trash.",2,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I love this mascara! I've been using it for the past 2 years and haven't found anything better - especially for the price. It makes my lashes look full and it doesn't easily run if I tear up or sweat. I found the best way to apply it when it is brand new is to dip the applicator/wand only once and do light coats on the upper lashes and then the lower lashes, then repeating the cycle without dipping the wand again into the bottle. This slowly builds beautiful, full, lashes without clumping, and it stays all day without flaking. LOVE IT!!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I saw this product rated #1 in health and beauty at a price less than $5.00 and since I was trying to find a non-clumping, lengthening mascara thought it was a no brainer to give it a try. I was amazed to find it lengthened my lashes with no clumping and looked so natural--not harsh and over coated looking. This stuff is amazing and I cannot imagine buying any other mascara again.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I’ve been searching for a good mascara for a while that was inexpensive. When wearing a mask I feel like my eyes need more emphasis. Finally, this is it. My lashes are long with one application. It doesn’t smudge, even when chopping onions and eyes are burning and watering. It removes easily with a makeup remover wipe. I will definitely be getting more of this!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
I love this mascara! I formerly used Better Than Sex and was tired of paying the price for it. I tried this after reading amazon reviews and have now been using it over a year. You can’t beat the price and I love that it holds the curl and doesn’t weigh my lashes down.,5,One,B00T0C9XRK
"So this product is pretty good. It's not AMAZING but it's good, especially for the price. Lashes might get a little spider-y but nothing a lash comb won't fix. I haven't had too muchof an issue with flaking, a bit of smudging while wet but, hello, it's wet so smudging is a possibility. Over all pretty pleased with the mascara, would purchase again.",4,0,B00T0C9XRK
I have tried many mascaras..expensive to cheap. This mascara is the best one I have ever purchased. For the price..it really shocked me how well it does. My eyelashes are not long..when I apply this...looks like I have beautiful fake lashes on. This really does the trick. Super impressed with this mascara. This is my go to.,5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I honestly don’t care for this mascara. I bought it because of the high reviews on Amazon however I feel that it’s overrated. The formula just isn’t very impressive. I do like the brush well enough, but it’s hard to remove and it’s flaky. Ultimately I don’t think I would recommend it and don’t plan to purchase again. I wanted to love it, but it simply didn’t work for my taste.",4,0,B00T0C9XRK
"This is right up there with some of the worst mascaras I have ever used, it clumps up badly, it shortens my eyelashes because of so much clumping. Because of COVID and not going out a lot I hadn’t tried it yet, but used it yesterday for a Zoom meeting and it was just horrible. I bought the 3 pack because of the reviews I watched, and my window of return expired on Feb 6th. I do NOT recommend this mascara at all unless you like your eyelashes short and clumpy.",1,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I can’t believe how amazing this mascara is for the price. I typically use the Too Faced Better Than Sex mascara, and this blows it out of the water.

"I have never tried this before so I was hesitant. It seemed like all these mascaras were the same, leaving me with crap eyelashes. I decided to try this because it's cheap and the reviews. I WAS SO SURPRISED. This mascara is awesome! I never take the time to review something unless I really like a product. Love this so much, will not be buying my other mascaras ever again! ONLY THIS!!!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
I’ve heard great things about this mascara so I have it a try. Worst thing about it was is rubs and smudges off underneath my brows and also under my eyes. I’ve never worn a mascara that did that as bad as this one did. I can’t even wear it without looking like a raccoon a few hours later. It goes on thick and can be clumpy as well. Definitely won’t be buying again.,2,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I was very excited about this product after seeing great reviews on Buzzfeed. It goes on great and definitely adds length and volume. I loved how it looked initially! However, the first time I noticed it was smudging below my eyes after just a couple hours. I am not generally oily, so this doesn't happen often with other brands of mascara. I tried additional times and had the same result. Because of this, I do not recommend.",1,0,B00T0C9XRK
"This mascara is clumpy. It does not separate my lashes well. And even worse, it 'crumbled all throughout the day, getting tiny pieces in my eyes. I think this is the worst mascara I have ever used.

"I have tried other Essence mascaras (pink tube and purple tube, not sure of the names) and so far have found them to be far superior to more expensive formulas but at a great price. They also seem to last FOREVER before drying out. I like this formula (Lash Princess False Lash) best out of all the Essence mascaras I've tried. This has a ""regular"" mascara brush (not those thick plastic nubs) so it doesn't deposit way too much. I've had no problems with it smudging or flaking. It does go on much smoother if you wet your lashes a little first.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK

I use this on a daily basis .. and All I can say is try it ... you wont be dissapointed . I will rebuy again and again .",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"It just like a basic mascara, nothing over the top special. Maybe because I’ve used mascara that really lengths my lashes before, it was a good buy though. There is just a different product I believe works better and provides 10x the length and volume and I’m used to that. But this is much better than most mascaras. If I wasn’t used to the one I use regularly, I’d believe it provides length and volume.",4,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I wanted a mascara that would really make my eye lashes look longer and ""pop."" This really does what it says it does! I'm very pleased with it.

My granddaughter and I have used this product for about a year. I gave it for Christmas stocking gifts too!! It is a really good mascara and at a fantastic price.....NO smudging at all and easy to remove with makeup remover wipes. It has good volume control but it tends to clump a little after a couple of months of use.,5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I’m scratching my head at all the positive and five star reviews. This mascara was a clunky, runny nightmare. Huge chunks would come off on my lashes and smudge easily. It would clump all my lashes together making me have to wipe it off at 6 am and use my old mascara just to go to work looking normal. Maybe I got a bad apple? I threw it out.",1,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I had heard so much about this mascara and was excited about receiving it. The first couple of times that I used it I thought it was great, but did it begin to get clunky as I put it on. It does cause my lashes to stick together It doesn't separate them well at all. And I cannot stand that clunky sticking together lashes when you're trying to put on your makeup. It's just not very becoming. And I'm older so I need the light separation of my lashes. I guess it's each their own, to sum it up I guess I was a little disappointed.",3,0,B00T0C9XRK

"Terrible. Caused a stye on one of my eyes after using for a couple of weeks. Absolutely do not recommend. I’ve never had a stye before and have not had any issues since discontinuing use of this mascara. I purchased one for me and one for my daughter. We both decided it was irritating our eyes and causing them to burn after several hours of wear (basically it starts to flake off and the little flakes get in your eyes and cause watering and burning). But on my way to an appointment, I realized I didn’t have any other mascara with me, so I used this one as a last resort. A few hours later a started to develop in the corner of one of my eyes. It lasted for 4 days and was so painful. I made sure I threw both tubes of this stuff in the trash.",1,0,B00T0C9XRK

I work a desk job from home, so I’m not up and about for most of my morning, yet by noon, I can already see it’s collecting around my eyes, and isn’t holding up.
Had such promising reviews, it was worth the try but will likely go back to my old tried and true.",3,0,B00T0C9XRK
I don't like this mascara. It goes on very clumpy and sticky. You have to use oil or makeup remover to get this off. Soap and water doesn't do the trick. This does not give me long pretty eye lashes. Won't be buying again.,1,One,B00T0C9XRK
Thank goodness only $5. Don’t waste your $$. It clumps and smudges. It looked like I had raccoon eyes after 30 minutes— so embarrassing! And it smeared so much it looked like I didn’t put any mascara on my lashes but coated all around my eyes. NEVER again will I believe the hype on Amazon! You get what you pay for.,1,0,B00T0C9XRK
Love this mascara. I was reluctant to purchase makeup online. Friends and family kept recommending. I was willing to give it a try for such a small price. It is amazing! Order and don’t delay!

"This stuff is not great. I really like some of the Essence products, but this I’m not fond of. It does make your lashes look pretty long, which is great if you want to look like you have 6 really long eyelashes. It’s so clumpy, and the more you play with it, the worse it gets. It does have a really nice dark black color, and stays on well but to me, those attributes are meaningless if the look isn’t good. It’s also a little hard to get off. I wanted to like this, but sadly this is a pass from me.",2,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Is it a good mascara .? Yea , for the price . It is great for teenage girls on budget but definitely does not deserve these amazing reviews.

"If this didn't clump so much, this would easily be the best mascara I've used. It takes your lashes from 0-100 REAL QUICK.

This sells in Ulta for $5 too so don't spend more than you need to!",4,4,B00T0C9XRK
"My eyelashes are very light and few! But this stuff... WOW i love this stuff. I wish I could remember what influencer I found this product from.
One swipe of this mascara and BOOM 💥 I have eye lashes! I put on abt 3-4 coats and feel like I have on falsies. I ordered 3 more one for each daughter and one more for me. It comes off well with soap water and/or make up remover.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
Pretty good considering the price. My lashes do clump together a little but I like it. It adds more drama. I feel it gave my lashes a lift. This does get in your face and eyes after it dries. Like 5 min later I had mascara flakes on my face and eyes which burned a little. If flakes bother you or you have sensitive eyes this might not be for you. When I’m done with this tube I will buy again.,5,0,B00T0C9XRK
After having allergic reaction to other mascaras I wanted to switch to something more natural and without harsh chemicals. I really wanted to love this mascara. It's just ok. It does add a lot of length to my lashes but with so much clumping. I have to use a lash comb to separate everything. I was not looking to add more steps to my morning routine. During the day there is some flaking and at the end of every day I have black smudges under my eyes.,3,0,B00T0C9XRK
Not hypoallergenic or for sensitive eyes! Had to remove within 10-15 mins as it started to burn. All Q&A's with the company saying its for sensitive eyes and hypoallergenic are false. Don't waste your money if you truly need hypoallergenic. It also smudges and clumps. Was of money and now my time to go return it.,1,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I used to buy high priced Mascara until
I learned it needs to be discarded after 4 months. And I only buy cruelty free products. This is the best low priced mascara ever and I’ve tried many. Separates lashes, lasts, and removes with eye makeup remover.",5,One,B00T0C9XRK
I was really excited for this mascara the reviews made it sounds amazing. It is so clumpy. I have have to scrape the brush multiple times just to try to get all the excess off. Also the brush shape is awful it just clumps on the eyelashes and it's not flattering. That on top of it being hard to get off just makes it a big fail. You get what you pay for I guess..,2,0,B00T0C9XRK
"The best I have found! I have tried high end mascara, designer named, naturals, you name it I will give it a go. I love make up! This was suggested to me and at the price I thought it wouldn’t be much good. Wrong! It’s amazing and gives me the thick, long lashes that the more expensive brands often fail to do. Buy it! At $5 it’s a steal.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I really, really, really wanted to love it. The packaging is super cute and the price is amazing. The volume factor is real. I looked pretty darn fantastic when I left for work in the morning with my new voluminous lashes. However, when I got in the car to leave, I was horrified to see the black transfer under my eyes. My tube-creating mascara never did this to me. Further, this stuff is super hard to remove. I wet my fingers and started to try to get it off to no avail. You need lots of makeup remover and honestly, even two days later, I still don't feel like I got it all off. Super disappointed, because it looked so great when I first put it on. Sad to say, not worth it given how much black smudge transfers under the eyes throughout the day. :(",1,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I like this mascara, i’ve been using it for a few weeks now. It’s very lengthening and I’m into it. However I don’t use this mascara on my bottom lashes because it transfers easily on my skin under my eyes.
Unlike other reviews my mascara came vacuum sealed in plastic, so that was nice.
Would recommend if you’re looking for affordable dramatic lash.",5,2,B00T0C9XRK
"Love, Love, Love this is so with it. I've purchased all different brands of mascara I've tried fibers, magnetic and glue lashes. Besides going to have lashes put on this product is the best I've found. I really recommend this product. In the picture I have the product on the one eye (right eye looking at the photo).",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I have no idea how this mascara has so many great reviews. I gave it a chance, even going as far as letting it sit in a mug of warm water before applying it to help it go on more smoothly. However, it is SOOO clumpy, I literally have to scrape off the excess from the wand when I take it out of the tube and it is very flaky. The only positives to this mascara are that it’s easy to remove and it’s super cheap. I’ll never purchase again or recommend. Drugstore brands work MUCH MUCH better.",1,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Hundreds of great reviews of this product in a Facebook group I'm in. It's fine, but not life-changing the way it's been billed there. For the cost, you might as well buy this as opposed to a drug store brand that will work just the same and cost a little more. BUT - don't necessarily expect fake lash-like miracles as some have noted. It might just be a nice mascara for you, as it was for me. And, you might be one of the lucky ones for whom this product really makes a difference.",3,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I was super excited to try this as it had great reviews and had seen it on several facebook lists. Like 30 things from Amazon I'd buy again ect. I am not impressed. The wand is ok, not my favorite as it's too thin for my preference. The mascara is to think and globs on the end everytime. It is also made my lashes super stiff and I see no way anyone could layer this product. When I tried it felt like I was trying to pull my eye lashes off. Overall it didnt live up to the hype only plus is the price.",3,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I bought this item much like I do all the others - I go by reviews; in this case they were wrong. I do not like it, the wand is terrible and it does clump your lashes together. I have still yet to find a mascara that I don't have to separate the clumpy lashes with a safety pin or ""roll"" back to give lift. Def not impressed and would NOT buy again. For a quick one-two coats I'll stick with L'Oreal unlimited lash or Chanel.",3,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I've used several mascara's for years and never thought of switching. Two reasons: I saw an ad and was impressed, as well I was having issues finding my Maybelline mascara that I'd used for a long time. My lashes are very light colored and the resulting look is just amazing. I will continue to use this product.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Let's get one thing clear, I LOVE makeup. I have very large eyes and have always had an issue with mascara getting under my eyes by the end of the day, it is annoying and makes me look sloppy. I have had every mascara known. I saw this, read the reviews,and saw the price so I thought what the heck. I would never use another mascara. I dont even ever leave reviews but I truly felt that this product deserved it. You wont regret buying it and for $5, just try it and see. I'm serious.",5,One,B00T0C9XRK
"This works so great! Super max volume! It does tend to smudge a bit, but it makes your lashes so big. If you put your regular brand on as a last coat - it’s superb!!",5,One,B00T0C9XRK
"DO NOT BUY THIS MASCARA! It caused styes to form, on my eyes, after 2 days of use. It also caused both eyes to become red and irritated. There are numerous reviews that state the same thing. I usually don’t leave reviews, but I’m leaving this one to warn everyone about this terrible mascara. Only purchase if you want red, irritated eyes with styes. YOU’VE BEEN WARNED!",1,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I couldn't give it a full rating yet because I haven't tried it, I will say it was packaged well, and; if it works according to the reviews that others have given it I will definitely be giving it five stars+🙂? I currently use a product by Maybelline Lash Stiletto & and with all the mascara products on the line I chose lash the little because it makes your lashes very long but very well defined there's no clumpiness so I'm hoping this product does the same, but; well really enjoy the fact that I got a similar quality product but at a much lower price 😊👍!",1,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I was told this was the best mascara ever and decided to give it a try since I’m not a mascara snob not to mention it was cheap, but I really do not like it at all. It claims its a false lash effect, but truthfully it’s nothing more than chunky. The bristles on the brush are so short that the mascara just all globs on your eyelashes. I honestly had to save my old mascara wand to use after I apply the new lash princess stuff just to comb through them and make it not look so caked on.",2,2,B00T0C9XRK
Okay so I gave this 5 stars despite wanting to give it 4 for one reason: VALUE. I literally used Makeup Forever mascara for years before this and barely notice a difference. I get the same level of flakage from this as BTS. If I were reviewing BTS it would be a 4 star review but this company has delivered you a product that is almost exactly the same in function as a high end cosmetic brand at a steal!!!,5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I heard about this by a youtube blogger. I really wanted this to be MY mascara. Its cheap, cute container, supposed to be smudge-proof... what more could you want? I work outside and the heat and humidity do a number on mascara. It isn't even warm yet but I had to wipe smudges from under my eyes. It was okay as far a volume and length, nothing to get excited about.",2,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I actually had a more expensive and better known mascara in my cart when I came across this. I always look for products that not only have good reviews but have a lot of reviews. Thought I’d try it and thought hey, even if I end up not happy with it, at least i didn’t spend much. My lashes are already a decent length, but oh my gosh!!! I can’t believe how much length it gives them. Not only that, but I love that it glides on pretty sleek and makes them look fuller. My eyes are also a bit sensitive to some mascaras and get easily irritated. No problems here! Coworkers and friends thought I had gotten false lashes literally. Bought 4 more right away. Awesome product and very inexpensive.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Love this mascara! It truly does add a false effect. My lashes are so full and dark after just one coat. It also will last all day. I wore this mascara every day during my trip to Vegas. It was 95 degrees outside, and my mascara was still intact. No raccoon eyes. My only complaint is that it is super thick. I have to wipe off the wand a little bit before applying, other wise it looks super thick and clumpy. Definitely a great price and wlll repurchase again.",4,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I love it! I usually only wear mascara, eyeliner, and *sometimes* eyeshadow. Mascara is definitely my most used thing in my makeup bag. And I'm very picky. I hate anything that makes you have tarantula lashes or smudges, and this does neither! If someone gives this product a bad review, my assumption is that they didn't apply it correctly....I'm glad I saw this on so many Amazon review recommendation pages! For 5 bucks you can not beat this! Don't think twice, order this mascara!!!!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Believe the hype. This is quite possibly the best mascara on the market. No clumps, insane length, great separation and volume, smudge-proof and lasts all day. I switched from my expensive $40 mascara to this & it was one of the best make up decisions I've made. For the price, you cannot go wrong with Lash Princess.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
This mascara is probably one of the most inexpensive mascaras I have ever purchased. It is also the BEST mascara I have ever purchased. It literally looks like I have false lashes on. I love it and now feel stupid for ever spending $20-$30 on mascara that I then put $50 fake lashes over lol. Just buy it. You'll love it,5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"The first time I used it when I went out to visit my mom. When I got home, I looked in the mirror and saw it had made dark smudge lines on my eyelids. I wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt because of all the good reviews. I put it on 4 hours ago and already have smudge lines. (See photo). I am going back to my Maybelline mascara. I don’t have this issue.",1,0,B00T0C9XRK
I had no idea my lashes were that long and thick! Amazing mascara. I did find that it could be a bit clumpy so I used an old dry mascara brush to separate my lashes and it worked great! Getting it off is easy but I find that the residue stays with you even after multiple wipes. I don't wear mascara much so it doesn't bother me but if you wear it all the time and need your eyes to stay raccoon free then you may want to invest in some actual eye make up remover. I only used the face wipes. I will definitely buy again.,5,0,B00T0C9XRK
I SWEAR BY THIS STUFF!!! It is seriously my secret product for incredible lashes. the wand is great for separating your lashes and the formula doesn’t get clumpy. Plus!!! Can you beat the price?! I’ve tried countless $30+ mascaras that can’t hold a candle to this! I will never use another brand of mascara again and I’ve been telling EVERYONE about this one!,5,0,B00T0C9XRK
This mascara was under my eyes ALL day! I only applied it to the top lashes and work in a temperature controlled office yet somehow it bled to my under-eyes. I have to wipe it often throughout the day and felt/looked sloppy. I also had a HORRIBLE allergic reaction to this all around my eye area! Right in the trash!,1,0,B00T0C9XRK
I’m on day 16 of Covid-19 quarantine for Pennsylvania so I didn’t do much with my makeup. I just put a quick coat of this mascara on to try it. So far so good! It feels pretty lightweight on my lashes and have a nice effect with just my quick coat. I’ve only had it on for like 30 mins so I’ll come back and update if something goes wrong. But so far I’m digging it =],,0,B00T0C9XRK
This mascara is garbage. I’ve seen it in every list of “must have” beauty items so I decided to try it. I’ve had it for two days. Yesterday I put it on top and bottom lashes and the mascara ran all over my under eyes in less than 45 minutes. Today I tried again and just went for the top lashes. Smudged all over my under eye and concealer in 30 minutes. Don’t waste your money.,1,0,B00T0C9XRK
"This was a good mascara for the cheap price. The attached picture is with no mascara, 1 coat and then 2 coats. I do agree with others that said I had runny raccoon eyes after a short time wearing it. Maybe with primer or baking it could have lasted a little longer but I have other mascaras that don’t do this under the same circumstances. Overall I was pretty pleased.",3,0,B00T0C9XRK
"First, you get what you pay for. This is a cheap mascara but with great reviews so I thought I’d try it out. Second, I opened the mascara for the first time and there is no cap or divider to “ring out” excess mascara from the brush whenever you’re pulling it out from the bottle... so the entire contents of the bottle basically just stays on the brush and is more trouble than it’s worth to remove every bit of excess from the brush whenever you’re trying to apply mascara in a timely fashion. If you have all the time in the world to remove excess mascara from the brush, by all means, buy this. I’ve never had a mascara designed or packaged this way. I’m not sure if I got a faulty bottle or if this product is just cheaply made always. Super disappointed.",1,0,B00T0C9XRK
"This is probably one of the best products I have ever purchased on Amazon. I usually use Benefit, Clinic or Younique fiber lash but I friend recommended this because everything normally use was flaking or melting from the heat of my masks and glasses. The volume is excellent. It doesn't feel caked on. Highly recommend.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I would love to say that this mascara was one of the best that I’ve tried in terms of volume and length. However, after using it for a few weeks, I’ve developed an allergic reaction to the formula. My eyes swelled up like golf balls and it taking FOREVER to feel better. This could have just been my sensitivity but needless to say I can’t use it anymore 😢",2,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I'm more of a tom boy, so this mascara is very thick and is hard for me to use. I feel like I'm back in 8th grade with the safety pin separating my eyelashes. I'm sure for the more experienced person that likes a heavy mascara it would work, but I feel like tammy fay baker when I use it. That being said, I still use it every day and it makes my eyelashes very long and pretty. Just a bit too thick for me.",4,0,B00T0C9XRK
"This is terrible. I had high hopes after reading the reviews but very disappointed. As far as length and fullness, totally missed the mark. I put on 3 coats and looked like one coat of my usual drugstore mascara. After lunch, I looked in the mirror and I had smudges on my eyelids and under my eyes. It looked like I had been crying ?!?!?! Waste of money, unfortunately. I will stick with my store bought brands and not buy this garbage again.",1,One,B00T0C9XRK
"You really only need to use one or two coats of this but you may not get desired effect that way. What happens is as you keep applying more coats to get that length and dramatic look, it gets clumpy and you end up with the Spider lash look. I do not like the Spider lash look. And it gets my lids very dirty, I do not recommend using for bottom lash line as it gets all over as well and causes for a lot of clean up. I probably spent 4/5 minutes more on mascara than usual with this one. Won’t be buying again- Will stick to my It cosmetic Super hero- My favorite!",3,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I LOVED this product when I first received it.....no gumming and glopping and it was inexpensive. However, I started to notice that by mid-afternoon the mascara was flaking and causing a lot of eye watering and discomfort. I tried using along with a different mascara to coat, and maybe stop the flaking, but nothing worked. Do NOT recommend.",2,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I read an article about an author's favorite things on Amazon. This was one of them so I decided to try it. I usually buy mascara from brands like Smashbox, Tarte, etc.. I find each of those kind of brands have at least one thing that is less than satisfactory. I LOVE THIS MASCARA! Like it advertises, it is smudge proof, removes easily, you are in control of volume. It also does not clump, separates nicely. It lengths my lashes. It looks exactly the same at 6 am as it does at 9 pm. It does not flake or smudge at all. I never write reviews but had to about this one. And it also is cruelty free!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Bought this after my cousin raved about it. One of the worst mascaras I think I have used. The formula sucks - gets all over my eye lid (long lashed girls,
You know what I mean) and is super hard to wash off (feels more like a waterproof). And the brush is average - kind of rough. Overall, no impressed and wouldn’t buy again.",2,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Wow! This mascara is the BEST! I am not one to fool with false eyelashes everyday so after reading the reviews in this mascara I just had to try it.

I will never go back to the other (more expensive) mascara that I’ve been using before this!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"This mascara is amazing! I was spending so much on other mascaras, but decided to try this one because of the price. I had zero expectations and was so surprised to love this one more than the $30 mascaras I had been using. It doesn’t last as long as others, however, for the price I don’t mind that at all!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I purchased this and have been using for about a week. So far I love it... Its not thick and chunky on my lashes but does create length.

Removing was ok but did smudge and have some extra clean up but wasn't worried cause it was end of the day. will totally purchase again!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"This is honestly the worst mascara I have ever tried. I have to wipe nearly everything off of the wand before attempting to apply it, or it leaves terrible clumps and gets all over my face. Not to mention it is nearly impossible to remove. Most mornings, I find smudges under my lower lid even after I am certain I got it all the night before. I have been using it for a couple of weeks, hoping that one day I can make it work, but I am giving up.",1,0,B00T0C9XRK
"The design of the product is super sleek with rubber designs to make it easy to hold and the wand fits nicely in your fingers. It is easy to add layers for thickness; it is easy to apply and stays looking fresh, not clumpy or sticky feeling to the touch. I have been loyal to two types of mascaras for 20 years and I will continue to use this mascara instead.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK

 Everybody likes fake eyelashes but I actually hate them. I hate playing with the glue, I hate having to clean the glue off of your lashes and I hate when you lose lashes using falsies. I am a customer of thrive mascara which is about $30 or $25 something like that.

"I was previously using a $25 mascara that does what this does that I loved but did not love the price. I heard this was a lot like the other. This mascara IS great and it does give the effect of false lashes. I love how it looks, however it is seriously difficult to get off. I ran warm water over my lashes and that didn't work. I used a lotion and that barely worked. My lashes became hard and crunchy like after they were exposed to water. I didn't buy the waterproof kind either so this irritated me a little. I bought some eye makeup remover today and if that doesn't work- I probably won't purchase this again. I hope it works.",3,0,B00T0C9XRK

This mascara is wonderful. I am a foundation and mascara type of makeup gal. Nothing more. With one swipe of the lashes, it gives me long false lash effect for sure, no clumps, and long lasting. If you want a more dramatic look, go for a second swipe! I have not worn it in water, so I can't rate the waterproof feature. I use a makeup remover and have no problem wiping it off.

"Typically one of my favorite mascaras, but I must have been sent the oldest tubes on the shelves. =(

I usually love this mascara and am excited to open up and apply this magical paint to my blonde, barely visible lashes! It makes them so long and voluminous! Much to my disappointment though, both tubes were dry and flaky, wreaking havoc on my poor eyeballs. My eyes looked like a reddish, clumpy, flaky mess. There was no handy hack that was going to save either tube. Will probably never purchase mascara online again.",1,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I have short blonde lashes and this really elongates and fills in my lashes. I like more natural looking lashes and I find it only clumps if you're using more than 2 layers (which it's so moist I doubt you'll need). And to give some context for the photo, I don't use an eyelash curler or anything to lift my lashes so the effect is completely from the mascara. It tends to come off on my upper lid if I sweat but I started using a primer on my lashes and now it doesn't. It works great for me and my friends who also buy the same product.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK

I wore it to take my son to the mall to meet a friend of mine and her son. We spent the day there. When I got home and looked in the mirror, it had smeared all over under my eyes! I've never had a mascara do that as badly as this one did, it looked crazy. I don't know why my friend didn't tell me, I can only think that maybe she didn't notice.",1,0,B00T0C9XRK
This might be the worst mascara I’ve ever used and the only redeeming quality was the price point. I saw how highly recommended this was and I wanted to love it so much but within an hour there were just black smudges all over my under eye area. I’m not sure if it’s just that the formula is too wet but it clumped all my eye lashes together and made me look like a raccoon. Removal required so much wiping because the formula was gummy.

"I don't write a ton of reviews, but after a week of use I had to come give some praise! This mascara is seriously fabulous. I have thin, sparse lashes, and I'd basically given up on my natural lashes looking flush, full, long and voluminous. I saw great reviews for this mascara on a 3rd party website, and figured ""Eh, it's cheaper than what I use right now, why not give it a go?""
Pure magic my friends. From the first swipe my lashes looked longer and more voluminous. I sent a picture to my friends, who I've often relayed my lash woes, and they were astonished! The first day I just did one coat. Today I did several, and my lashes could blow away they're so full and long. Love it! I didn't notice any smudging or flaking, but I'm going to try the waterproof one next for some variety (and for weddings, cannot keep my eyes dry at a wedding!)",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I think we have different definitions of false eyelash look. It sure packs a punch, but I go from natural looking lashes to 5 clumps of stuck together lashes really quick. It works well weigh if I take the time to remove most of the product before using, use only on the outer half and use a clean spoolie brush to transfer some to the inner half, and comb through the wet lashes like crazy. Too much work. Plus, all that messing with the lashes makes them lose their curl. I'll stick with my Maybeline.",3,3,B00T0C9XRK

Smooth, effortless application, gives the illusion of doubling my already long blonde lashes, and never has a bad day.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I love this mascara. It does the job well and the price point is amazing. It does take a little bit of scrubbing to wash it off at night, but the volume and lengthening it gives makes it totally worth it. It’s a deep black color and you don’t need to pile it on at all, it’s super effective with just one or two coats. LOVE! I tend to have sensitive, watery eyes but had no problem tolerating this and no weird reactions like I get with some other products.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
At first I loved this product. Until I noticed that it smudges and almost drips down my eyes. Definitely not a winter mascara. I know mascaras arent all water proof but I’ve never had this issue with regular mascara where it smudges and gets so wet on my lashes while I’m outside. It’s hard to explain but it’s just not good. Definitely going to try a different mascara. :(,3,0,B00T0C9XRK

"For the first few days this was a dream come true! I loved loved loved the brush; great separation, no clumping, could pump up the length and volume with great control. Then after a few days, was like most of the other mascaras I have ever tried, even with wiping off the brush before use, massive clumping. I have even tried to follow up each stroke (daub is more like it~) with a spooley brush, but really is just crap after a few uses. Very hard to remove, too, even though I supposed have the regular version and not the water resistant version. I sadly ordered a second one before I realized that the joy didn't last, probably will just reserve it for a few special occasions then throw it away like the first one.",1,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I was really impressed with the volume and length I got from this mascara. I was not expecting it to work so well at such a great price. Only problem is, it smudges pretty easily. But, it's very easy to remove. I will definitely try the waterproof version for when I want extra long, smudge proof wear.",4,0,B00T0C9XRK
"This is a good mascara! I have used every expensive brand plus cult-fave drugstore brands but I really like this one a lot. The wand is thin which I prefer because I can apply my mascara more precisely. The mascara doesn't glob on either, so I don't need a spoolie to clean up my lashes after applying.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Yup! thank you everyone to write a review. I would never have chosen this mascara without your feedback. I have been spending tons of money on mascara in the effort to obtain gorgeous lashes. And, this is awesome! I use Lancome's white tube mascara as a base and follow up with this product. For daily use, I place this mascara just on the ends of the lashes.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Comparing to pharmacy brand marscara - this one is comparable. It applies with ease and it does somewhat extend my lashes but that's where the pros end.

It flakes and smudges within an hour. Within 2 hours i look like a racoon because I am wearing half of it under my eyes.

Pass.",3,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Top left: naked lashes.
Top right: one coat, no curl
Bottom left: curled, two coats. Final look
Bottom right: I added a coat of Mabelline falsies on top for the finished product!
I am really impressed by this mascara! I normally pair the falsies mascara with the Benefit rollerlash mascara that is $24. This is just as great, if better than the rollerlash! For literally $20 less, I am loving this! This was my first time wearing, so I’m not sure how well it will stay or how easy it comes off. I like how there was no clumping and normally cheap mascara smells, well cheap! This doesn’t at all which I love! I was totally expecting it to smell strong, but no smell! I am very impressed! I will update later if it stayed on well and if I was able to wash it off okay!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I have very light, thin lashes and sensitive skin and eyes. I was very hesitant to try a new mascara, especially at this price but the reviews had me intrigued. Not only did this mascara find lashes I didn't know I had, it brought them to lengths I didn't know they could be and lasted all day without smudging. The brush is simple and effective and I'm extra thankful for that. Great product and great price point. I'm shocked but thank you!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"LOVE IT! I get the false lash effect without the hefty price tag of other mascaras. I don't mind spending money on good products, but this mascara does exactly the same thing as Thrive, Imencils, and Better Than Sex so it makes sense to buy it instead. I have very thin lashes and it doesn't clump, it gives me the perfect volume and amazing length, very easy to wash off too. I love that it's cruelty free! This is a must have.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"This is a really great mascara when you first put it on. It glides on, great coverage, no clumps and really extends lashes. One coat looks like lash extensions.
However, if you have oily skin or live in a hot, muggy climate, this is going to smudge and give you raccoon eyes.
But, with some primer and setting powder before you apply and a lot under your eyes, and if you’re going to be indoors, you can’t beat this mascara or the price.",4,0,B00T0C9XRK
Smudges badly. By the afternoon I looked like I had raccoon eyes.,2,2,B00T0C9XRK
I had to buy this because of the hype it gets on YouTube ..... but I hate to say it .... why? I really don’t see the magic ? If I’m honest I really didn’t like it at all. I love long thick voluminous lashes! And this just did not take the cake for me! Hands down the Loreal paradise (dupe to better then sex by too faced),2,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I absolutely loved this mascara. I dont wear alot of make up, only mascara and eye shadow. I would never put fake lashes on nor do I want them to look fake. This mascara with just 3 strokes and no clumps dazzled up my eyes. Some mascaras have a funky smell (I'm sensitive to smells) and this did not. I think it's better then most store brought or high end cosmetics and cheaper. Bonus its vegan (I am not) and not tested on animals. If u want dazzling eyes definitely buy this!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
This is a thick mascara that will make your lashes thick and clumpy. Was expecting a better product given all of the excellent reviews. I’ve used it for a month and it still makes my lashes stick together and I have to comb them apart. Yes full lashes are nice but not when they are all stuck together.,3,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Love it, Love it, Love it!!! You really look like you have fake eyelashes on. This mascara is amazing! Not thick and lumpy, glides on smooth & precise. You feel like you had a makeup artist do your eyes!!! Last all day, no touch up required, no smearing, no clumping. I use soap and warm water to remove. I am 500% completely happy and satisfied!",5,3,B00T0C9XRK
"My first order of this mascara was awesome! Excellent! Great volume! It actually made my lashes look like I was wearing false eyelashes, it was THAT good. So this time I ordered two! NOT so good =( I don't know if I got old inventory or the formula changed, but both tubes were next to dry. Fortunately, I still have some left in my old one. So disappointed. Guess I'll have to either find another supplier or look for another brand =(",2,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I bought this due to the good ratings. I curl my eyelashes as they are stick straight. This mascara takes away the curl. But my bottom lashes look great with this product. They appear lengthened and it does not clump. Also does not flake!
Would not recommend to those who curl their eyelashes.",3,0,B00T0C9XRK
This mascara definitely lives up to the hype. It’s a little difficult to remove in that it leaves raccoon eyes. It lengthens and volumizes very well.,5,One,B00T0C9XRK
"These arrived in a condition which is unsafe to use. They were unsealed and open. The wand was not even pushed down into the mascara container all of the way. There was a round, clear plastic sticker partially stuck onto the base part of the mascara. I will not use these as they were obviously open and unsafe. It should be noted that the sticker is completely ineffective as a tamper proof seal. It can be removed and then stuck on again without showing any tampering. These are not safe to use. They could be contaminated. They are not refundable, either. I DO NOT recommend this product. UNSAFE to use near your eyes!",1,4,B00T0C9XRK
"I’ve never written a one star review, but I wish I could give this zero stars. Not only is it clumpy, but it also smudges and is still somehow really difficult to remove. And worst of all, after trying it just twice, my eyelids have become red, swollen, and very painful. I’ve never had a bad reaction to any mascara ever, but thus stuff is just vile. I see now that many, many other have had bad reactions as well. I don’t understand the hype surrounding this product or even how it has not been pulled from the market for safety concerns.",1,0,B00T0C9XRK
Great mascara for the price. Works as well or better than some of the expensive brands.,5,2,B00T0C9XRK
"This does enhance your lashes, but it's too wet. Smudges easily when putting it on. I like how it makes me lashes look full and long, but you have to have a steady hand and time to let it dry. Also if you are out in the sun or wind, and your eyes water a bit, you'll have mascara under your eyes and on your eyelids.",4,0,B00T0C9XRK
"BEST mascara for length & volume- and it’s so AFFORDABLE!!! I would pay double because it literally doubles the look of my lashes. So much so, that I had to keep a picture of the tube for all the ladies that ask what I use. I will update a photo of my eyelashes soon, I don’t have one right this minute. Falsies (green dots) is the line you want!!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Edit: This stuff is the devil to try to get off, even with makeup remover and its not even waterproof! Won't be buying again.

I've tried many brands and this one is definely a steal for $4.99! I like that this formula is wetter and buildable, but it does make a little mess at first. The length is awesome and it the brush gives great separation.",3,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Hated it!! Everyone was raving about this product so I ordered it! Big mistake. Huge!! Used once and looked like I glued feathers and lint to my lashes! So clumpy!!! Now, if I used my great lash wand and only put a small amount on it wasn’t as bad, but, I wouldn’t take it if they were giving it away, too flaky, too clumpy, nothing like it should be... I’ll stick with maybelline great last...",1,One,B00T0C9XRK
"Not sure why everyone loves this stuff. As you can see from my photos, it smudges like crazy above my eyes after all day wear. This is at 5pm after putting it on this morning for work. No unusual sweaty-ness or anything.
It doesn't really give any false lash effect either. Disappointed",3,0,B00T0C9XRK
Yes this mascara does make thicker way longer lashes but I had to carefully separate my lashes with a safety pin. It does make way longer and thicker than any mascara I've ever tried but not for me with it lumping eyelashes together. That might be a look some want to achieve but not me. Think Tammy Faye Baker.,4,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I don’t really want to leave a good review because I don’t want to need more and have this sold out! I have always had the shortest lashes, and mascara has always been pointless to put on, never seemed to make a difference. Until now. This stuff is AMAZING. I actually have lashes! My husband, who usually doesn’t notice these kinds of things, asked if I was wearing fake lashes! I showed my 14 year old, and let her try some, and she did one swipe on her lashes and said Oh DAMN! She then quickly looked up and apologized for her words 😂 but we decided that was an appropriate reaction. I’ve tried the $20 mascara that promises all of the things and doesn’t deliver any of the things, and this little $5 find is beyond better",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
This product does exactly what it says. Your lashes look absolutely gorgeous when you use this. I couldn't believe the volume I had on my lashes. There were two issues I did have with the mascara. It is very difficult to remove even with makeup remover. I also have very sensitive skin and it made my eyes itchy. So I'm no longer able to wear it.,5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I know most mascara products cost more but I decided to try this one and have placed my order for another. It does not smudge like most and stays on all day. It is also easy to remove at night with just your daily cleaner. For the price, you have nothing to lose but you will be amazed and reorder!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK

"Omg. These are one of the BEST mascaras I've ever used. Pro tip: You should try to warm your mascara up and bit first before putting it on so its more melted. You can put it in your cleavage (and if you don't have any or just don't want to, thighs and armpits are cool too). Don't forget to put it only on the tips of you lashes.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"One of my favorite Instagram bloggers had raved about this mascara not only for the quality but for the price too! I was definitely skeptical because of the price, but I was proven wrong quickly! I wear falsies every day and use a light coat of mascara underneath...This being said, no need for the falsies anymore! Such a voluminous mascara for such a steal! I used to buy Too Faced's ""Better Than Sex"" mascara for 22 dollars a bottle. however, these are so similar!! If you haven't ordered it yet, just do it!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Not sure why this got raving reviews? It is near impossible to take off, clumps up, and I have super long lashes and just made them look like a spider? I have never been sensitive to any product made my eyes red and teary. Yes it’s super cheap but a $12 mascara is far more superior. Are these real reviews?",1,0,B00T0C9XRK
Waste of money. When I opened it it was so thick and gunky I figured it was expired. Once applied it gave me tarantula lashes in the worst way. Do not recommend,1,One,B00T0C9XRK
"This is great for the price - it built long, thick lashes. The downsides for me were 1)It seemed to smudge a little more than most mascaras; and 2)it only comes in black. Despite the slight smudginess, if this came in a dark brown, chestnut, burgundy or navy blue I would order it constantly. The black looks a little hard on me. But totally worth it for anyone who isn't a blonde or redhead.",4,0,B00T0C9XRK
"It wasn’t better as far as length than my Marc Jacobs I’ve been using (that’s great) but over all just as nice. Also, it’s didn’t smudge as much as MJ so an added plus. Also, it’s a fraction of the cost. $5 vs $35 is a no brainer. It doesn’t take a second coat without clumping but you don’t really need it with this brand. Best $5 mascara I’ve ever used.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I have long, but very light lashes compared to my thick, dark hair. I typically use covergirl mascara but wanted to try something new when my last bottle went dry. I have only used this once so far but I was very impressed with how it looked. I added a picture to compare my eyes with and without the mascara. I don’t think it is as clumpy or flaky as some other products I have tried and I believe my lashes look fuller and longer.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"This mascara is amazing! I’m glad I made this purchase, it was sitting in my cart for a while. Shipping was quicker than expected and this mascara really makes it looks like you’re wearing false lashes. It clumps just a bit, but nothing too crazy. I will have to update after wearing a few more times but first impression is pretty great!! Recommend.",4,0,B00T0C9XRK
Love this mascara! With one swipe I get 200% thickness and visibility to the lashes. It is also quite smudgeproof and very easy to remove. I have tried many of the Big Brands and find this to be superior. If I want to look like I have false eyelashes on I swipe my lashes several times. Very reasonable price too.,5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I'm so bummed!! All of the claims this would stay put and within an hour it had left big flakes and smudges under my eyes. It does make lashes nice and defined and long- not volume, but def length. But it migrates off my lashes and under my eyes every time I wear it. To me that means it's not worth it. I don't want to look like a raccoon or have big black flakes under my eyes. I'll stick with better brands that don't have this issue. Even if I have to pay more. Ah well. Too good to be true.",3,0,B00T0C9XRK
I've been using this for about 7-8 days now and I love it! I saw the other reviews and I thought for the price why not and glad I did! I was using a L'Oreal mascara forever which is about $8-9 a tube and it doesn't last long. This stuff really makes my little lashes long! Would recommend,5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Love it!! Very easy to use, meaning I just did 2 coats, not need of doing more than that. I love that they look long without looking fake or clumpy. It gave me some volume but again, not excessive that looks fake. I don’t like the excessive fake looking. It is also easy to clean, it removes easily!!!
Would definitely buy again, the price is great, especially because I never finish my mascaras and after three months, most of them become too thick or weird that I end up throwing them, so 4.99 every 3 months it’s not so bad!!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"This mascara isn't a miracle by any means. It does give my lashes a full look, but I can also get this with my other mascaras. The winning element for me is the time it takes to get the desired look. With this product, I get full lashes much quicker than I can with my other mascara brands!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Within hours of applying it , I had smudges of the mascara below my eyes ( from blinking?). The consistency is thin compared to a typical mascara; I can see that as a pro or con. As someone who has Celiac Disease, it's ridiculous and obnoxious to promote it as gluten free product. Its piggy-backing on a diet fad of people eating GF without the medical need to do so. The likelihood of consuming the mascara, and thus being ""unhealthy"", is slim to none.
I don't understand the 4-5 star reviews. I will not buy it again.",2,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I mean maybe I have lashes that don't work with this mascara? Mine are long and regular volume, I usually use stuff like Roller Lash or They're Real.

"After seeing this mascara on the Today Show as a hot item to buy on amazon, I was so excited to give it a try. For $5 what’s to lose? The mascara goes on smooth and is easy to remove with eye makeup remover. My lashes didn’t flake while I wore it. What I didn’t like about it was my eyes were itchy and irritated every time I wore this mascara and for several hours after removing it. I’ve stopped using it because my eyes are too important to risk irritation from a cheap mascara. I really wanted to be surprised by it! I’ve never had any allergic reaction to any makeup or mascara.",1,0,B00T0C9XRK
"You really need to scrape off most of the product on the opening (so you don't waste the product) because SO much comes off the brush and does not give that perfectly separated lash look. Maybe add a lash comb to help but I highly recommend scraping off excess product to prevent clumping, because girl, IT CLUMPS. Now, on the other hand it does give volume and I've had success with that aspect.",2,0,B00T0C9XRK

IMHO you will not find a better mascara and certainly not for a more reasonable price.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"For the small price I paid, I wanted to try it. It gets amazing reviews, but I honestly have used much better mascaras. I don't coat my lashes too much, however this mascara flakes during the day!

"This goes on a bit goopy but man, I love it. It lasts all day. Never smudges. I usually like a washable mascara- dislike waterproof So this is perfect.
It definitely requires a makeup remover to get off from under eyes after a shower, but as I would expect. I use Almay eye makeup wipes and requires just a couple wipes- no scrubbing.
Definitely a must-have in my makeup bag. Love this",5,0,B00T0C9XRK

I like this mascara very much. It goes on easily and is easily removed ..no tugging or pulling. It just gently washes off. It applies evenly and has nice volume with a couple of coats.

"I really wanted to like this because it’s so cheap and it’s so highly rated. But I have thicker eyelashes and the brush bristles are meant for finer hairs, so this tangled up my eyelashes and it didn’t give me a full voluminous look. It just made them spidery looking. And I cried a single tear and the mascara smudged everywhere. This will work great for people with fine or sparse eyelashes, but if you have normal or fuller lashes then this may not work",2,0,B00T0C9XRK
My all time favorite mascara. Forget the time and trouble of false eyelashes. One coat of this stuff and it looks like false eyelashes. Goes on smoothly with no clumps and mess.

The mascara is not bad for the price at all I'm satisfied for the most part. My only issue is that it seems extra wet for lack of a better term. When I am applying the mascara it is almost as if it drips a bit especially when doing my bottom lashes. It's quick and easy to wipe away cleanly without using remover or removing my other makeup much but still a bit aggravating especially when in a hurry for work. I seem to get it above my eye as well when applying to my top lashes again wipes away easily and just a little touch up eyeshadow and I'm good to go.

"This mascara had some fantastic reviews (and was such a steal!) so I gave it a go. It is a nice deep black color, and it lasted fairly well on me. However, i found it difficult to apply. My lashes didn’t hold their curl with this mascara applied, and it was a little gloopy/wet, meaning it smudged quite a bit during application. I don’t typically have this issue with any other mascara I use. The mascara provides a reasonable amount of volume, but the texture takes away from both the volume and length. It is a really low price point, and performs similarly to drug store mascaras that run a little more expensive. I would say it’s worth it to spend more and try The Balm Volumizer mascara which delivers what this mascara can’t quite manage.",3,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Love, love, love this mascara and all the Essence products I use! A friend that was stationed in Germany with her husband recommended this. I have used a lot of brands and have been using a very expensive mascara for years and years. I tried this and I can't believe I was paying so much for mascara when I could have been using this one. I just hope they don't change anything about it. I haven't tried the waterproof mascara yet. My daughter is now using this one too! It's great! (I paid full price for this and didn't receive anything for doing this review - just sharing my own experience with this product.)",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
I’m not sure what all the hype is about.... I thought this mascara was ok at best. I find it to be clumpy and makes my lashes look scraggly. I have to layer it on to get the desired look and then my lashes feel overly heavy. It also leaves smudge marks above my eyes from where my lashes make contact with my brow bone.,2,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I have been searching for so long for a mascara that comes with enough product, glides on smoothly, and makes my eyelashes look like natural eyelash extensions! It also does not clump my lashes together and is extremely affordable! I am so in love with this mascara! I might be a lifer with this one :)",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"There is a reason this mascara has so many awesome reviews. It’s because it’s actually awesome! The only slight against this product I have is that it’s difficult to take off, and if I scrub too hard sometimes I’ll have an eyelash fall out. I have gotten so many complements whenever I wear this, so I just got eye makeup remover (as opposed to the “simple” brand makeup wipes) to take it off. Great buy!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I really love this mascara. It’s buildable and gives a nice fan effect. Definitely adds to the length of your lashes as well. In my pictures, my left eye is clean and my right eye has two coats of Lash Princess. There’s a major difference there!

The only downside I have noticed is that the lashes can get spidery with too many coats. Otherwise, I love this stuff and it’s definitely in my top 3 mascaras.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"This product had great reviews so I tried it. It’s makes lashes super long, but it is soooo thick and clumpy that I have to work hard to separate my lashes and get rid of the clumps. Wish it was thinner. It does stay on and it is easy to remove. Also works well with contact lenses.",4,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I was pleasantly surprised with this mascara. It's inexpensive and yet works great. While I do notice an occasional smudge throughout the day, for the most part it's fabulous. I have naturally short lashes and this actually tends to make them look a little longer. It separates the lashes really well. It's definitely worth giving a shot if you are looking for a reasonably priced mascara or if you just aren't happy with what you find in the stores.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I am not impressed. I expected much better by the reviews. This mascara is gobby & globby. It seems too wet. It does not lengthen. It does not go on smooth. It dries hard, not flexible. Then it comes off in little crumbles. I have never had a mascara quite like this. Low end, poor quality .",1,0,B00T0C9XRK
I have a hard time finding a mascara that I like and this one is now my favorite!! I purchased on a whim while scrolling though Facebook newsfeeds and see one of those top 33 things you should buy. And it was the best whim purchase I made. Works amazing and apples better than most high end mascaras out there.,5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I was sitting in bed watching makeup tutorials, and one of my favorite makeup artists recommended this brand. When she mentioned the price, I knew I HAD to try it. Let me tell you now, it's my new favorite. Ive been using it for a few weeks now and I'm very impressed. I'm not a fan of falsies, so I really need a good mascara that doesnt kill my wallet. I would recommend this mascara to anyone. It holds up to sweating AND crying, what could be better than that??",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"For $5 I don’t think you can beat it! I do wish there was a bit more volume to it but next to my $30 mascara (better than sex) I really can’t tell a huge difference! This was a bit clumpier but not so clumpy I’m going to toss it.

UPDATE: this item smudges quite bit. Looks nice but by mid day I’m full raccoon!",4,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I'm forever on the search for the perfect mascara. I was seriously sooo pleasantly surprised by how amazing this mascara is! I don't do false lashes, which can make my makeup look incomplete, but this mascara is awesome.
The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because the formula is sort of chunky, it can clump very easily if you aren't careful and it does transfer, so be careful if your eye look is perfected because it's so sad.
But anyway, great mascara for an amazing price. I wouldn't even bother get anything else in this price range. Still like it more than Better Than Sex.",4,One,B00T0C9XRK
"I love a long lash as much as anyone else. I’m a minimalist makeup enthusiast. Lashes that look like you have extensions without the price? Yes please! Plus, this was reviewed as a ‘top product’ on a tv show.
But, alas, it didn’t deliver. Long thick lashes, yes. The brush is a bit large for the tiny bottom and inside lashes. But the bigger problem is the smudge. I was smudged in hours or by the end of the day! Boooo. Then, 2 washes with makeup remover and still chunks leftover. I need a mascara that stays on",2,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Wow! I am constantly on a quest for good (and inexpensive) mascara. BULLSEYE! This stuff is great. It went on well with just one coat, but I added a second just to see what the effect would be. I’m 50 years old, put my lashes are still pretty long and curly, just not very thick. This mascara made my lashes look amazing! I’m very happy!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Based off what I read from a blogger, I was expecting to get much more volume and length to my lashes. I found that the application goes on ""clumpy"". It's not difficult to remove this mascara. I didn't find this to be any better than what I was using from a big brand mascara at the same price point.",3,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I have never written a review before but after using this mascara I had to. I go through so many mascaras trying to find one that I like enough to stick with. I tried this one after watching a video with Bailey Serian(?) using it and talking about how wonderful it is. Holy smokes was she right. This stuff is amazing. It makes my lashes so long and thick in one coat. No clumps, sticking together or chunks sticking to lashes. It stays on all day and does not smudge. It even comes off easily with a makeup cloth with no hard rubbing. I have at last found my mascara! No more searching. I will not be using any other type ever again...",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I got the water-proof one first and while it does have less smudge, it is super hard to get off. So expect a little smudge by the end of the day but easy to remove and great lashes!",5,One,B00T0C9XRK
"When this arrived, I was a little put off by the packaging. There's no way to really tell if this has been used in the past, just a clear sticker slapped onto the bottle. However, I really fell in love with this mascara once I used it. This has to be the best one I've ever used. I love the low price, I would not have bought it had it been any more expensive.
I've posted a before and after photo for reference!",4,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I don't recommend this mascara, because it smudges very easily. I wonder how much damage I've done to the delicate skin under my eyes from having to frequently wipe away smudges. // I've come back to revise my review. I met some friends last night. One of them looked at me and said, ""oh, my god, how did you get a black eye?!"" I didn't have a black eye, just bad smeared mascara!",2,0,B00T0C9XRK
I loved that this product made my lashes long and thick! No need to put on fake lashes when you use this mascara! I would also note that this is not water proof. They do make water proof mascara under the same brand. I didn't want water proof because I wanted this product to be easy to remove.,5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Provide great length and volume, but gave it 4/5 stars because it smears underneath my eyes within a couple hours of wearing it",4,One,B00T0C9XRK
"I found this mascara to be very clumpy. I had to wait for my eyelashes to dry so I could comb out the clumps. Once you get the clumps out, it looks very nice but with the straight wand, I get more mascara on my eyelids than I do with a curved wand.
Also, this only comes in black, wish they had a brown-black as that goes better with my skin tone.",2,0,B00T0C9XRK
"This is the absolute best mascara I have ever used hands down! And let me tell you..I have tried dozens of mascaras from high-end to drug store brands; mascara is my number one go-to makeup item! I have light eyelashes so mascara is a must. This mascara volumizes AND lengthens and builds up like a dream! This mascara has no smell and does not irritate my eyes at all! Not to mention, you absolutely can't beat the price!! I have purchased multiple tubes of this and will continue to buy this as my number 1 choice! Please never stop making this, Essence!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I'm so excited that I ordered this item, it's a super surprising mascara it is amazing at the length that you got just from two coats my lashes were lush and long,I never could put fake lashes on this gives the appearance that your lashes are actually yours and they are so if you're thinking about getting it do yourself a favor and get it is a great buy awesome product.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I love makeup. With that said, this is my new go to mascara! Over the past year I've noticed most mascara, even those for sensitive eyes have bothered me. This did not. Pretty good to lengthen and thicken.
Some fallout at days end but nothing terrible. I'll happily continue to use!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"This rivals another brand I love but it is a fraction of the price.
The texture on the applicator lid prevents slips (unique feature). The brush is perfect and the formula for the mascara doesn't have any discernible scent and stays on until I'm ready to take it off.

Update: A guy friend recently commented on how long my lashes are, *they're not long* this mascara is that awesome.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
This is a really great mascara! I have damaged lashes due to many years of wearing lash strips every day. I have never found a mascara that works like this and ive worn really expensive ones. Im a lash fanatic and am a fan of this mascara. Doesnt smudge either. This is 3 coats.,5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"This is one of my favorite mascaras. The price and the quality literally is a no brainer! I don’t need to use many coats to get it to the volume I want, and to take it off is not bad at all. Just use your typical makeup wipes. Definitely would recommend!

@Mags_Bernard",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I really like this mascara, especially for the price! I'd say it's definitely more lengthening that volumizing, as it tends to give more of a spidery look (which I don't mind). I recently got lash extensions out and dealt with very short, stubby lashes for a while, but with this on they looked much longer. Every mascara I have ever used ends up giving me black marks under my eyes as the day goes on, and this one does the same. However, if I stick a little powder under my eyes after I put the mascara on it's much less likely to smudge. Besides, it's so cheap, there's really nothing to lose by trying this out!",4,0,B00T0C9XRK
"This eyeliner is amazing.
I read the reviews and had to try it. Completely impressed. It lengthens eyelashes on a single swipe and DOESNT CLUMP. No spidery lashes to contend with. Great control with the brush.
My only little thing is that it does transfer to the eyelid if not careful. I go over it once with a waterproof mascara to keep it in place and dry it but it’s not needed if you’re a patient person...I’m just not that person.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I was a little sketched out about buying a mascara I'd never heard of. I used ""better than sex"" mascara and lived it but it's so expensive. The reviews were positive about this mascara so I gave it a shot because it was under 5 dollars and that's an acceptable loss if it didnt work. Needless to say, I am very pleased! There was no clumping and only one application did the trick of giving me outstanding lashes. But I did do two coats because there is no such thing as to much. I love this mascara and will buy it again!!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
This mascara is excellent I hardly have any eyelashes didn’t expect too much as the price was so cheap but this product is far better than the expensive Lorac brand I usually buy which doesn’t even come close to making my eyelashes as full and long as your product! Love it!!!!,5,0,B00T0C9XRK
My new favorite mascara! This was my second purchase and I am still just as pleased ! The price point is amazing and the product works better than most at the drug stores. It makes my eyelashes look full without adding 5 coats and weighing them down. I tell all my friends about this stuff,5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I don't like the fact that it falls super easy,i ended up with all my underwear eyes black ☹ maybe I should try the water proof version. I really love that it says is cruelty free and gluten free,this is super important when you buy a cosmetic product. I really like how my eyelashes look with one layer,but then when I applied two I didn't liked ,started looking chunky and sticky,for now my favorite is still the voluminous lash paradise(no waterproof version). But this one is good too,just apply one layer and be prepared for then to clean your under eye after some hours.",4,0,B00T0C9XRK
I was very skeptical given the price of this mascara. I normally purchase from Sephora and spend $20+ on mascara. However the amount of reviews this product has intrigued me. I was plenty surprised the product really is amazing! Great length and lasts through the day which I was surprised. Highly recommend!,5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I read several reviews before I ordered this mascara, and was persuaded to try it, and I also bought the primer. The product itself worked great- just a few clumps and it stayed on all day. My only complaint is that the tube ran out in about a month. It’s not as if I pile on 5-6 layers- usually 1-2- so I feel like I didn’t really get a good value (despite the inexpensive price).",4,One,B00T0C9XRK
"Such a bummer! I had high hopes due to the exceptional reviews. And yeah, I'm willing to say it's probably me. I look at myself half way through the day and I can see dark smudges on my upper lids as well as below my eyes. I do tend to run quite warm so that's probably the reason...but, honestly, it's worth trying. You may not experience the same issue and you'll be thrilled by its ability to build really well and you can't beat the price!",3,0,B00T0C9XRK
All the bloggers rave about this and I’m not sure why. It applies clumpy and doesn’t last throughout the day. By mid day I look at my lashes and the product has fallen off. Maybe if you used this with a primer? They’ll compare it up against a $20+ Mascara and it’s just not comparable. I’d say go with a well known drugstore brand and you’ll be better off if looking for an affordable product.,2,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Love this mascara! It really volumized the lashes. Lasted all day without smudging. Came off with makeup remover, but it took a couple attempts....this stuff really stays put.

I have super sensitive eyes and a gluten intolerance and this did bother my eyes at all! This is my new go-to mascara",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
Very pleased. Have bought several brands of mascara lately and didn’t like any of them. My daughter told me about essence so I thought I’d give it a try. Love it! Will purchase again.,5,4,B00T0C9XRK
"I have been searching high and low for over a year for a good mascara that wouldn’t make my eyes itch or become irritated, but to no avail. My Disney Princess eyes were put on the back burner. I stumbled upon this mascara in a Buzzfeed article for great makeup products, and decided “what the heck, why not try it? It’s only five bucks”. My package came in the mail today, and I have been pleasantly surprised at how well it has stayed on my lashes with minimal smudge-edge, and zero itchiness. It applies SUUUUPER easily and without any clumping, and I’m hoping it remains that way. So far, THE BEST mascara I’ve used in a long time, at a beautifully inexpensive price that my college wallet can manage, and has brought back the Disney Princess eyes look I’ve so missed!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Like most chicks with short ass eyelashes, I’m always on the lookout for a good lengthening mascara. Don’t believe the hype on these reviews. It clumped together immediately leaving some sort of uni-lash. And doesn’t hold out very well over the course of your day. The amazing lengthening it brags of was nothing impressive to behold either.",1,0,B00T0C9XRK
"This mascara is amazing. It’s very lengthening! Let me tell you, I sweated and cried while wearing this mascara and my eyes looked pretty good. A bit of flaking and smudging that is natural for someone who cried but it wasn’t as bad as I thought it would be. I didn’t experience raccoon eyes as of yet!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I usually just use regular mascara so I cant compare to similar of this, but I didn't realize what a drastic effect this type would make for me. I applied two coats and had nice dark lashes that looked longer than normal and stayed up and curled which never happens. Very pleased with this mascara and cant believe the price!",4,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Love Love Love this mascara! I have sensitive eyes/skin and usually purchase Clinique. After reading the reviews here, I thought I'd try this. It's great! I don't have to mess with several coats, a few swipes to cover entire lash and it looks great-full and long. It does 'run' a bit...After about 12 hours I've noticed some shadow under my eyes but I don't mind. The way my lashes look are worth me having to check my eyes ocassionaly.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"First let me start by saying the mascara definitely looked gorgeous on. In that respect, it delivered what was promised. It went on evenly, lengthened, and thickened beautifully.

Woke up this morning to a terrible allergic reaction. The skin around my eyes are itching and burning and clearly very swollen. This has never happened from any beauty products I’ve ever used. Actually, it’s never happened to me before, period. So something in the ingredients is causing this allergic reaction. I figured I’d pass on my experience as a warning.",1,0,B00T0C9XRK
I have to use a clean separate spooly to minimize the amount of product before it gets anywhere near my lashes. I’m not a fan of the spider leg look on my eyes. The opening needs a tighter de-gooper. This has gone into my “only use if desperate” makeup stash.,1,5,B00T0C9XRK
This is my new favorite mascara! The first time I put it on my daughter asked if I had applied fake lashes because that’s how long and full they made mine look. I have sensitive skin and eczema and I have to be careful about the products I use but I have had no reaction to this one at all. Definitely going to be a regular purchase from now on.,5,One,B00T0C9XRK
"I decided to try this mascara based off the reviews. And I must say I don't see what all the fuss is about. It is an okay mascara for the price.

"Ever wondered what it would be like to spread literal pudding on your eyelashes? This formula is way too thick for me. Yes, it lengthens lashes, but it doesn’t provide that false lash effect I was hoping for. I know lots of us are on the lookout for budget-friendly buys, but this one missed the mark for me. I will finish this tube, but most likely will not rebuy.",2,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I originally rated this as a not recommended product. However, after several uses, I find I really like this mascara and will be buying again. It originally went on very thick. After a few trials it goes on very smoothly and quickly. Stays all day without flaking, and I really like how it defines my sparse lower lashes.",4,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I tried this mascara because of all the hype & great reviews. Its nice, but nothing spectacular. Didn't look like I had false eyelashes on.

After the second application it created little globs of mascara at the end of my lashes and clumped together so badly I had to wipe my lashes off completely and start over and I had the same results! so I used a toothpick to separate and ended up with racoon eyes after a few minutes of sweating. Spend the money on good mascara.,1,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I used to pay $24 for Benefit “They’re Real” mascara. No more. Maybe it’s a little better?

I’ve been wearing this for at least a year and I don’t plan on changing.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK

"Best mascara for length I’ve ever used by far. I love how long my lashes are when I use this mascara. My only complaint is that it does feel heavier than other mascaras and takes a bit longer to remove with makeup remover, but that could also be because it’s waterproof mascara.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I have long'ish, wild, natural eyelashes with a mind of their own. Applying mascara has always been a time consuming challenge that I typically skip for daytime makeup & only bothered with for ""going out"". This mascara was a game changer for me.

I find myself using it even for ""minimal effort"" day makeup.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I really like this mascara. Application is clean and easy. Lashes appear longer, but not clumpy or heavy.

Will definitely continue to use this product.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"This is the closest mascara I have found to They're Real by Benefit, which sells for around $24. I've experienced minimal smudging with Lash Princess.

My mom happened to be about and I passed it to her after using it once, and she raves about it. Great product, just not for those with lenses!

I truly wish I hadn't wasted my money. This product was dried out and when I went to use it all the mascara was gooped on the center of the mascara while the ends of the brush we sort of dried out..
I did manage to get it on my lashes after cleaning the excess off the wand. Later in the day ( within in a few hours ) It flaked everywhere under my eyes. --->Not a good find.
Don't waste your money.",1,0,B00T0C9XRK

This product definitely does what I was hoping; my eyelashes look full and long. I have naturally short, light eyelashes. And you can’t beat the price!!

It looks great once all the clean up is done!",4,0,B00T0C9XRK
"So disappointed with both this and the volumizing version by the same brand. At first I was in love; very minimal clumping, nice long lashes, washes off easily. I like the wand. I was excited!!! After about an hour my daughter said I had something just under my eyebrow. Upon checking the mirror I realized it was smudged mascara. It was also under my eye, giving me the dreaded racoon eyes. I've tried it a few times since, both formulas, with and without primer, and same thing happens every time. I am so disappointed!!! Don't waste your $. I'm so glad this crap only cost me $5 each.",1,0,B00T0C9XRK
I wanted to love this so much because of the price. I’ll stick to paying more. It left my lashes clumpy and didn’t elongate them like other mascara’s. They’re naturally pretty long so it’s worse that this didn’t do much. They wouldn’t stay fanned upwards like mascara usually does.,1,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I purchased this item because it had so many great reviews and the proce was super reasonable. I do think it added volume to my lashes, but it doesn't stay put. After a couple hours of wear it is on my eyelids and under eyes. Despite it not staying on my lashes it is hard to get off and I always wake up with racoon eyes.",3,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Still took a chance after reading the reviews, but y'all this mascara is awesome. I don't have very long eyelashes, but this mascara adds so much volume and really lengthens my eyelashes. This will definitely be my mascara going forward was very pleased with the outcome!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Love this mascara and love the price even more! Outperforms other mascaras at way higher price points. For me, this was a great dupe for the L’Oréal Lash Paradise (runs around $12). Goes on a little thick at times for me, but easily fixed by brushing through your eyelashes with a small brush (or even your finger) while wet. Doesn’t clump or smudge, goes on very smoothly. Way easier to remove than other mascaras I have tried. I will definitely be repurchasing.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"i had saw this item on a “must-have” list, so i was very excited to try this, but it’s kind of disappointing because it doesn’t lift or give my lashes any volume. it goes on smooth, but smudges easily. the brush does not have a particular shape such as hour glass, etc which i’m not a huge fan of.
i like that it’s black in color, and it comes off easily when removing my make-up but it’s probably a product I would use if I needed back-up mascara. it would not be my first choice. it’s supposed to be a dupe for better than s** mascara which i LOVE, in my opinion, it’s non-comparable",3,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I am in my sixties and haven't found anything that works on my sparse eye lashes. This mascara is the bomb.
I only use it on the outer edges of my lash line and yes, it worked like no other. It felt so good to have some lashes again!
It did come off fairly easy with soap and water, yet it lasted all day.
For the price, I am one satisfied customer. I will buy it again.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Perfect ! I have read some whiney reviews and realize companies pay people to write reviews, good or bad. I'm not paid for any review and after using this I have ordered more. It goes on perfect. It wears all day long perfect. It gives perfect volume and length. And, at the end of the day it came off perfect. Excellent mascara at a great price.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"This mascara is just ok. It curled my eyes lashes and initially it looked great. However, after a short while it was smudged every where. I looked like a raccoon! It was also really flakey. When I went to remove it, I first used hot water only and then my daily face cleanser which usually removes all my makeup from my face. It did not work. The mascara was so difficult to remove from around my eyes and eyelashes. If anything, it is truly water resistant.",2,0,B00T0C9XRK
I was very disappointed with this purchase. The mascara flaked really bad within just 20 minutes of putting it on. It also smudged under the eye causing black under eye when wearing for extended periods of time. It also didn’t have the volume or natural look mentioned by other reviews. When I curled my lashes the mascara didn’t hold the curl like other mascaras do. It instead caused them to go flat due to the weight of the mascara. Overall I would not recommend if you are wanting a good everyday mascara that doesn’t flake or smudge.,1,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I wanted to love this product. But it’s by far the most difficult mascara to remove. I’ve tried pricey and cheap mascaras and while this one gave me decent volume, I still couldn’t love it. It routinely smudged under my eyes after a few hours of wear. Frustrated it didn’t work out as well as Better Than Sex mascara",3,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Pros: vegan, cruelty free, very affordable
Cons: clumpy, takes a lot of strokes to see results. Very frustrating.

I would not recommend this mascara, and I will not be purchasing it again. Which, I’m really bummed, because I’m looking for an affordable vegan mascara, and I was really hoping that this mascara would be it.",2,0,B00T0C9XRK
Tried the waterproof first but it was Soo hard to get off so I decided to try this one. I like the way it looks but it is ALSO hard to get off unless you use make up remover wipes yet it smudges under the eyes to give me that racoon look lol I'll be returning for the waterproof one I guess.,2,0,B00T0C9XRK
"This product is simply amazing! I only had to stroke it on my lashes maybe 3 times to archive a high volume look! My other mascara would need 8-10 coats to achieve the same volume. In 90 degree weather, working out, chasing after a toddler, and a good long nap- this mascara passed the smudge proof test ! Which made it a little difficult to remove at the end of the day . Totally worth it!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I was reading an article on the top best amazon make up products when I came across this gem,
I right away ordered to see if it was true, and boy was it point on, I just love how much longer it makes my lashes and doesn’t clump up, I’ve been a maybelline volume mascara fan for years, so I was willing to take a chance, the only thing that I don’t like is the removal process it is a bit hard to come off but other then that no complaints same price as my maybelline mascara, so if you’re looking for something more natural get this I promise you, you’re going to love it !!!!!!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
I was super hesitant because of the price of this mascara but it is incredible. They make my lashes look incredibly long and it doesn’t flake. The only complaint is that my eyelashes are so long with this mascara I can’t wear my glasses haha which is pretty amazing.,5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I bought this mascara due to the popularity I saw online because I don’t like spending $30 on mascara. For the price it’s an ok product. I’m super picky as I really hate mascara that clumps up after a few uses. I haven’t gotten super long lash results and it doesn’t bother my eyes, so I’d buy it again just for the price and convenience.",4,0,B00T0C9XRK
I have always been a very low maintenance girl so wearing mascara was always a nightmare for me. I also have extremely sensitive eyes and I wear contacts. I've tried a few mascara and they always irritated my eyes causing them to water horribly and sting. Even the hypo allergenic ones irritated me. My eyelashes are basically nonexistent and I wanted to try this since it has so many great reviews. This stuff is amazing!! Not only does it not sting or irritate my eyes at all but it looks like I actually do have some great long lashes! This comes off super easy with eye makeup remover and doesn't smudge at all. I absolutely love this and you really need to try it. For the price it can't be beat. Just look at my before and after photo. That is only with 1 coat on. This mascara is a miracle in a bottle!,5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Please don’t ever change this formula!! I’ve been thru so many brands looking for one that truly lengthens and separates my aging lashes. Finally, I found this one and it does all I want while also lasting all day long. I’m very pleased and hope it never changes!!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
I love this mascara I use the waterproof and my sister uses the regular one and they are our favorite. It gives you so much length and volume unlike any other mascara I've used,5,One,B00T0C9XRK
"This mascara is all the rave in a FB group I'm in. I ordered some and then went and looked at the amazon reviews and contemplated on cancelling my order, but thought for the price I would try it out. I'm sooo glad I did!!! While I realize everyone is different, I didn't experience any raccoon eyes. It didn't flake or run during the day. When I pull the wand out it wasn't clumpy at all. Just the right amount of product and it applied very nicely. I only needed 2 coats to get nice long and separated lashes. My tube came completely sealed in plastic. I also really like that the handle has nice grips on it. For the price you aren't out anything trying it to see if it works for you.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I LOVE the way this mascara looks on, I just wish it didn't give me black circles under my eyes by the end of the day. BAD ones. Seriously, this would be the perfect mascara if it didn't smudge so terribly and I also have to really work with the brush before I apply it because it gets major clumpy. It even gives me black spots on my eyelid and I can't figure out how that happens.",3,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I was having a super hard time getting this mascara off my eye lashes when washing my face. Then realized they accidentally sent me water proof! My return date has expired. Would appreciate being sent the right product. Check your product before using.

Review of the water proof - The brush part of the applicator is super long and mascara is wet. I get it everywhere.",2,0,B00T0C9XRK
My photo is after wearing for 11 hours without looking in mirror or fixing anything. I have been using younique mascara for like 4 years or so and Haven't found anything comparable-- until now! I am super happy with this product and how it looks even at the end of the day. Great deal too!,5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"This stuff is ahhh mazing! I never see my lashes in photos. One coat is enough for me bc I like a natural look. Doesn’t smudge. I work outside and it lasts all day! Love love love! And it’s comparable to Thrive mascara which is my current favorite, only 1/4 the price!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
It's not perfect but it served it's purpose. Definitely have my lashes length and lift (a barely have any). This is the not waterproof one so if I cried a little yawned and cried it smeers. However one day it rain and I thought it'd have racoon eyes...but I ended up not having them. Maybe it just has its days where it feels like cooperation lol,4,0,B00T0C9XRK
"The title says it all. I'm out having lunch with a friend and she seems very focused on me as I am telling her a story. When I finished she says: "" are those ur lashes?"". It was then I realized she wasnt focused in what I was saying but rather my lashes. TRUE STORY",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Oh. My. God. I've heard hype about this mascara for a while from bloggers etc but never tried it. Now that I tried it I won't be going back!! I usually use Clinique or too faced which are easily 3 times the price. If you've been hesitating , definitely try this. As you can see in the pics, my lashes are basically non existent without mascara lol the second pic shows how amazing this works with just two coats.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I love this mascara. I was a little skeptical at first because it’s price, however I was surprised by the quality. It makes it seem like I have false lashes on when I barely have anything. For a girl that doesn’t use makeup ever this has become an everyday item I use to make me feel a little bit better about myself.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"For a cheap mascara it does a better job than expensive ones. Legit the volume is wonderful, give it a try if you have already spent so much money on others mascaras if you end up not liking this one at least its not that expensive but I’m 90% sure you will love this mascara.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Along with so many, the waterproof Essence was my ride-or-die. I don’t know what happened, but I won’t be buying it again. I tried in different weather; I tried with a primer; this tube smeared within an hour. So many say the formula changed. I didn’t listen.

Third tube ever. Will NOT buy again.",1,0,B00T0C9XRK

"Very good for a low price! Definitely buildable but starts to look a little clumpy after a few coats. Leaves a residue on skin after washing with soap and water, but they all do.

"I dont usually wear make up, especially mascara because every one i try (from places like clinique or sephora), i end up paying so much and they dont hold up the curl in my lashes and even with a couple coats it doesnt seem to last or even look like i have anything on, BUT THIS mascara is the first one i ever found to really pop my lashes, maintained the curl and definitely looks thick, and lasted all night.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK

"I got this on prime day, after continually hearing all the hype I thought I'd give it a try since it was on sale.

Probably trashing this...",1,0,B00T0C9XRK

"I should’ve listened to the one star reviews. I have long, straight lashes. This made my eyelashes look weird, and I couldn’t even curl them with my curler. It does not give volume, but spreads the lashes apart from each other further. You get what you pay for.",1,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Absolutely love this mascara.
Goes on great, stays, is easy to take off, extends your lashes and does not test on animals.",5,One,B00T0C9XRK
This is the best mascara I’ve ever used. I was previously obsessed with younique’s mascara because of the length it provided but it was almost $30 shipped. Essence mascara blows that out of the water. My lashes are longer than they’ve ever been. Love love love,5,0,B00T0C9XRK
I am a huge mascara fan. Typically use high end brands. Bought this when it was recommended by an Insta blogger. Well this company nailed it. Is it magic? No. Does it make you look like you are wearing fake lashes? No. But is it well worth the price? Absolutely. Will definitely buy again.,5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I bought this mascara because Bailey Sarian recommended it on her channel. It’s amazing and beautiful and makes my lashes appear long, full, thick and perfect. Easy application, long lasting, smudge proof, and it’s not technically water proof so it does come off with whatever you wash your face with.

I do have to wash my eyes a little longer than usual or use an extra wipe to get the excess off or I have raccoon eyes.

This is my favorite mascara and I’m only using this from now on.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"This is a real review, no one asked me to write it but when I find a product I really like, I’m going to say something.
This is awesome!! Not only because of the price but the length and your lashes don’t clump together!! I can use one coat and it does the job. Highly recommended!!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I loved it the first couple of applications, but it does seem like it will get dried out and kind of ""goopy"" quick. It is good though, especially for the price!!! It didn't smudge, but was easy to get off. It made my eye lashes huge. I just hope the mascara stays fresh in the tube and doesn't get sticky.",4,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Never heard of Essence mascara until my friend insisted I try it. Best mascara I’ve ever had! Everyone asks if I have extensions!!! I still don’t know which I like better...the regular or waterproof. It’s the least expensive mascara I’ve ever had, works wonders on my unremarkable lashes, & when I wash my face, it comes off w/o lash loss!! Tell everyone to try it...I did!!!!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I love that it's vegan and cruelty free and SO affordable. The brush is awesome. It looks so pretty, but no matter what I do I end up with raccoon eyes within the hour. Smudges and creates ugly under circles that are difficult to wipe off. Going to try the water proof version over it but would not recommend or re-purchase. I am not sure what do to to get amazon to STOP sending me things in plastic. I have complained about this for years, messaged customer service, emailed. Please put me on the NO plastic ever list. So sickening to receive one small product that is not fragile at all in a bunch of non-recyclable plastics.",2,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Love the way it makes my lashes stand out, lots of volume. It also comes off easily, no problem there. But it might be just me, but this product and every other mascara I've used flakes off and onto my face. It's every product I've used, but this one looks great when I first put it on.",4,0,B00T0C9XRK
Heyyyy! I thought this product would be like some of the others I’ve tried. This product works GREAT. Trust me on this one “I DO NOT usually write reviews “ . It works great with just one coating but if you wait a couple minutes it’s even better.,5,One,B00T0C9XRK
"I would suggest this product because the length and volume that it adds to your lashes are amazing! Also, the mascara is very affordable compared to other mascara products on the market. One issue I have with the mascara is when applying the mascara, a lot of times it smudges onto my eyelids. Nevertheless, it is a great product to use to give that boost and lift for a beautiful look!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
I saw this product in an online review and usually I love what I get from those reviews. This mascara is cheap and definitely shows it. It is clumpy and too much ends up on the brush that I have to scrape the brush constantly to remove excess product. Disappointing.,3,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I love this mascara! My lashes are pretty straight naturally. Average length,but this mascara made them appear so much longer! I curled my lashes, used only the mascara,no eyeshadow or liner. This mascara freshened up my eyes without all the makeup. 30 seconds of application and out the door! I use a baby wipe to remove and it comes right off.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I purchased this after a friend recommended it. It definitely gave her a false looking set of eyelashes, and when I finalized my makeup look with this for the first time yesterday, I was pleasantly surprised by the look! The size of the brush is perfect for getting all of the lashes. My lashes looked long and black, and I had zero issue with flakes all day. If there is one thing I wish this did better, it would be add curl. I haven’t found this adds a ton of volume either. But I can remedy that easily by buying a curler and applying more than one coat!! I definitely recommend. The price is unbeatable!",4,0,B00T0C9XRK
"This stuff looks great BUT it takes a few minutes to dry (and it gets all over my eyelids), then it runs after a few hours, and it smears like crazy instead of wiping off.
I have oily skin and I live in Texas - this stuff was a dream come true when I left the house but a nightmare by end of the workday.",4,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Soooo clumpy! I have no idea why this has such amazing reviews. I had to spend several minutes combing the clumps out with my eyelash brush. By the end of the night, a lot of it was smeared under my eyes. I do not recommend and will definitely not repurchase.",2,One,B00T0C9XRK
I like this mascara. It is great especially at this price! It goes on smoothly and my lashes dont clump. It does need some make up wipes and a bit of elbow grease to get off. I have tried many mascaras in the past and this is my favorite. It doesnt drunk out my lashes and start to crack into my eyes at the end if the day. I have bought this item 2x as of now and will continue.,5,0,B00T0C9XRK
I love the look it gave. You could definitely tell that there were fibers in the mascara to create a lengthened look of the eyelash but it wasn't too over the top. It still looked quite natural. The bottle itself is really pretty. It came really secure with the safety plastic intact. Will be buying more of this mascara!,4,0,B00T0C9XRK
LOVE LOVE LOVE this mascara! I cannot get enough of it! I have used both the waterproof and regular and love them both! I use the waterproof in the summer especially because of the humidity in the south and it doesn’t run or flake. Best mascara I have ever used!!,5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I bought this mascara after seeing the reviews and hearing all the good things about it. It didn't live up to the hype. It goes on too heavy, it has good coverage but it doesn't lift and separate the lashes like I had hoped it would. It is easy to remove with make up remover.",3,0,B00T0C9XRK
Makes my nonexistence of eyelashes look amazing. I have eyelashes that point straight out so you can't tell I have them. This mascara changes that. I have had so many compliments when wearing this masacara. Twice have been asked if I got eyelash extensions.,5,0,B00T0C9XRK
Got it fast in a complete shrink wrapped pack! Was just finishing my make up and I tried this I'm LOVING the volume and length it gives at 1/2 the cost I've been paying! Will definitely order again! Only thing I don't like is that it doesn't come in water proof and if you have longer lashes you have to technique how you put it on.,4,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I think as a mascara it's totally fine. I've used better ones and I've DEFINITELY used worse ones, but as far as the False Lash Effect I felt it was lacking. It does add volume, but no length whatsoever, and so far seems to last all day without smudging and smearing. Not a bad purchase for the price, but don't get your hopes up for any lash magic.",3,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I feel like I'm missing out on something with this brand. It is super clumpy when it goes on, even after wiping a lot of product off the brush, and after a few hours, I have tons of flakes under my eye (and quite a few in my eye which isn't the best...). For $5 its not awful, but I'm not going to buy it again.",2,0,B00T0C9XRK
"The first tube of this that I bought would have gotten a five-star, glowing review. It did a great job on my lashes and was not clumpy at all.

I'm glad I waited. This second tube is not the same. It's so clumpy that I'm going to pitch it. I don't know which is the anomaly, the good tube or the bad, so I won't reorder.

I'm disappointed. I LOVED that first tube.",3,0,B00T0C9XRK

"I LOVE this mascara. I can't believe the low price. My only issue is that I feel that it is harder to remove than most.

"Easy to apply - meaning I can put it on in a minute or two. I don’t have to keep going over it or trying to separate eyelashes.

I’m sold on this product!!",5,One,B00T0C9XRK

After application, if I blink, I have to tidy up my eyes as mascara does get on my skin under my lower lashes. Once it’s dry, it’s amazing! Great coverage and lots of extra body to your lashes. The applicator is angled to give an easier application of the tiny inside eyelashes :) overall great product and will be buying it again! Way cheaper than the brand names that give the same results!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK

I don’t really care considering the price and if you can’t afford a $11 drugstore brand I guess this is fine? Better than nothing? It’s clumpy, smudges almost immediately and just overall looks like garbage. I have naturally long-ish lashes and generally can’t go wrong, except with this mascara. I was very, very wrong.",1,0,B00T0C9XRK
"This mascara is ridiculously awesome! I have very long natural lashes and I usually have problems getting mascara all over my lids after I’ve already applied eye shadow, but this brush is just perfect! I’m also a hair stylist and most mascaras heat up and melt, sometimes smearing around my eyes from the heat when I’m doing a blow out. This has not done that! It’s also one of the easiest to remove. I can’t remember the last time I only spent $5 on a mascara! This is amazing!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Wanted to love this mascara so bad, seeing as how so many do... but for me it is just ok.. definitely smudged after a few hours on my bottom eyes so next day I applied one of my other mascaras over and that did help with smudging, but still just.. ok...",3,0,B00T0C9XRK
"yall, the bristles on this wand are ridiculously hard and sharp.
yes, I graze the end of my eyelid at the follicles of my eyelashes. I have very short eyelashes - I lost them after my child was born and they never grew back long.

these bristles hurt. I threw this away",1,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I love this mascara and for the price you can’t go wrong. I am personally happy with the amount of volume it provides to my lashes, how super black it is and that is easy to remove it with either a makeup wipe or makeup remover. After a while it will feel like is getting dry but I personally love it more when it is coming to that point. It is not a high end mascara but it does the job if you want a everyday look that still makes you look put together!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I am really impressed with how this mascara amplifies my lashes. I do find that it clumps a bit, but that's workable. It does smudge a bit in certain circumstances (being sweaty, watery eyes, etc.) but overall, I really like it. Removal can be a little tough, which is why this mascara got a four star rating instead of the five I really wanted to give it.",4,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I normally use Younique. Thought I would try this. OMG I am so thankful I did. Price is very reasonable. Whereas Younique is very expensive. I found Lash Princess to go on smooth, no flaking. Easy to take off. I did rub my eye with the mascara on; no flaking, no smudging. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND. I will be placing another order today. For those that their eyebrows aren't full enough; yes I did use the mascara. Great Idea, it worked and eyebrows looked natural.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
I have purchased both regular and water proof mascara from essence and both smudge and flake. With the water proof I expected more but it did not stay on. After a few hours of outdoor skiing (and not wearing goggles) it had come off and flaked above and below my eyes. Looked terrible. Will not be buying essence mascara in the future.,1,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I ordered this mascara mainly bc I saw how many reviews it had & it did not disappoint! I am absolutely in LOVE with this mascara & it works great for me! I do makeup on the side for events & I have been telling everyone about this makeup instead of spending $20+ on other name brand mascaras. For $5, I can’t complain! My new go-to mascara!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
It sucks because this could be a really great mascara but there is just too much that gets into my eye. I’ve only used a few times so I know it’s not because it’s too old or anything I could’ve done to ruin the product. Looks great but hard to remove and so many clumps get into your eye. Will not purchase again.,3,0,B00T0C9XRK
This mascara is awesome. I found this on a FB site and I can’t say how great this product is. I’ve made more for a much less quality mascara,5,One,B00T0C9XRK
"I've gotta say, this product really works great and I wanted to love it so badly. It works exactly as advertised, but I should've listened to the other reviews that said how badly this stuff irritates your eyes and skin surrounding your eyes. I've never had reactions to makeup before, I've never known my skin to be sensitive. Been using it for over a month and the irritation is crazy bothersome. Thought I'd get used to it but the reaction with everyday wear doesn't seem to be getting milder. Granted it was only 5 bucks so didn't lose much, but I really wanted this to work out instead of going with the regular $20-30 mascara I usually buy.",3,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I like it. Gives good volume and length for $4.99
Idk why sometimes even with makeup remover and face washing it's like it doesn't come all the way off lashes, but other times if I tear up it disappears 😂
Don't notice much smudging, the last one I got was clumpy but I've not noticed it in my purchase after that.",4,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I've tried a lot of mascaras over the years so I wasn't really expecting to l♥ve this one any more or less than another. I do! My eyelashes definitely appear longer and more lush. I don't believe this is meant to be waterproof (I don't like waterproof mascara). It has held up well at a wake (I cry at coffee commercials so...) and yet, removes relatively quickly with my usual facial wipe. L♥ve, l♥ve, l♥ve it!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I already have super long and super thick lashes, but they're so curly that it's hard to tell since they're curled back to my eyes (imagine half circles instead of smile shaped lashes).

this mascara is excellent.

I tend to apply from underneath as usual, but then from the top to straighten them a little, and when I do that with this mascara they look phenomenal. I've also started using a new mask and since my skin looks so great (quarantine, baby!), I've been able to just do my brows and toss on this mascara and be ready for the world.

will post pics the next time I use it!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"During quarantine I haven’t been wearing much face make up with a mask, but I surely want my eyes to pop! The wand and quality of the mascara is perfect and the price is impossible to beat. I have used DIME volume mascara, Thrive Eyelash Extension and Younique Moodstruck 4D (all are amazing) but Lash Princess is right up there in quality for a fraction of the others prices.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
This product is corn free! I am allergic to corn and corn related products. I could never figure out why my eyes were always itchy until I started looking at ingredients in my eye make-up. Holds up well. Removes with soap & water or an eye makeup remover. Now that I am not wanting to rub my eyes all the time I can once again wear mascara! Thank you!,5,0,B00T0C9XRK
This mascara is great! I've been a Lancome girl for years and I read something saying this mascara was great for the price. It is! It compares well to much more expensive ones. It lengthens and thickens my lashes. I love the wand too. It has some detail on it that gives it a nice feel and grip.,5,One,B00T0C9XRK
"My lashes are so long and thick with this mascara. Didn't think it was waterproof but it does not easily wash off with soap and water. I had been using Loreal Volumizer Mascara for years before this but will not switch back. Highly recommend, in fact, plan on giving one to my sister for Christmas.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I am so disappointed by this mascara. After a lot of positive reviews I tried it and it's a total flop. When you first apply it looks very pretty but after 15 minutes it begins to melt into eyes. It makes my eyes so irritated, watery, and gave me severe headache. At first I thought I am having a bad day but I applied 03 times and same negative results. Overall I found this mascara harmful for my eyes health. I do not recommend it to anybody.",1,One,B00T0C9XRK
"A good mascara that is almost great. Goes on smooth and has a rich formula. Unfortunately, if you have hooded lids it WILL transfer. I tried with concealer and without. With a cream base and with a baked powder base. One way or another the mascara ended up smudged above and below my lashes by 3pm.",4,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Horrible! Worst mascara I’ve ever used. Went on super chunky, smudged within an hour, flaked and dripped off when my eyes got a tiny bit watery. I thought with all the good reviews I would like it but it’s going straight into the trash can.",1,One,B00T0C9XRK
"I received it and it did not have a seal. I tried it for a few days and it was ok, but was a little messy to work with. A few days after I got a stye in my right eye and a week later two in the left eye. Since I never had a stye before, it's hard not to believe there was bacteria in it. Can not prove it, but all in all, there are better mascaras out there.",1,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I read the reviews because nowadays it’s what’s required to ensure you are knowing what kind of product you are getting ready to purchase. With that being said, you can still purchase something with all the hopes that you are going to be satisfied, and yet you are not. It was clumpy and really caked up my lashes. It DID NOT offer any of the things I thought it would (elongate lashes & add volume). I had to keep taking an older wand and removing the mountain of excess product. Overall, I will stick with my drugstore brand.",1,0,B00T0C9XRK
I am very disappointed in this product. I bought it after seeing excellent reviews and it being featured in buzzfeed articles. I tried it and it 1) Does not hold my curl 2) Is not smudge proof or waterproof 3) Doesn’t add much volume. I know it’s affordable but don’t waste your money. Spend your money on L’Oréal’s Feline or Voluminois mascaras in waterproof. Also affordable. 10000 times better.,1,0,B00T0C9XRK
"The. Best. Mascara. Ever. I have tried a lot of different mascaras, and this is THE BEST I have ever found for under $45. And I'm not about to pay $45 for mascara. It is lengthening, volumizing, moderately curling, just absolutely amazing. I don't know how they did it, but they did it right. HIGHLY recommend.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I don’t write reviews and I’m also a mascara snob but this mascara is incredible! I ordered it because of the great reviews it had but didnt expect much from it. People are always asking me if I have extensions or where I get my fake lashes and are shocked when I tell them it’s just a $4 mascara! I used to exclusively buy high end mascaras but this one is now my favorite.
It gets a little smudgy on the bottom at the end of the day but many high end mascaras do the same. I just want to find the waterproof version for the summer, this is my new go to!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
I have been using the same mascara for years. I decided to give this one a try for the price and reviews. I am so thrilled I did! It is amazing! No clumps and makes my lashes look long and pretty! I have blonde lashes so I can’t see them without mascara; this gives such a WOW effect! New costumer for life for sure!,5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I wouldn’t compare this mascara to falsies but it’s overall a good mascara. I don’t wear false eyelashes so when I find a mascara that says it gives you that look, I’m game to try it at least once. This mascara was goes on well, not clumpy at all...even after 3 layers, not too heavy, flexible without flaking.",4,0,B00T0C9XRK
"This mascara has got to be THE best one I have ever purchased. I have spent more than three times as much (Bare Minerals brand) as I have for this one and there is no comparison! It goes on well without clumps! It is easy to apply a second coat if you so desire. It didn't smudge for me and yet it was easy to remove with a make-up remover towelette. Just purchased a second one to keep in my ""go"" bag.
I don't think you will be disappointed in this product!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Idk what to think. Makes lashes good and longer. But it flakes on face by end of day. You have to have REAL good mascara remover because my god this doesn't want to come off. It also is a bit chunky, and I hate chunky mascara while trying to apply. I really want to love this but I more dont like it. It's also not water proof.",2,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Very impressed. For the price, this mascara works great. I prefer waterproof mascara, so I haven’t tried the regular one yet - but I was extremely impressed by the way the waterproof one goes on, how it made my eyelashes look, as well as how it stayed on without a lot of smudging or flaking. It is a bit hard to remove but I don’t mind that when I mascara stays on as well as this did. I definitely recommend!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"With even one coat of this mascara, I look more awake than with 10+ hours of sleep and two cups of coffee. The first words out of my mouth this morning, when I tried it for the first time, was ""WOW!"" Seriously, the price is amazing, the formula is amazing, the brush is perfect for reaching all the corner eyelashes and getting right up against your water line. You won't regret this purchase!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
I didn't expect much when ordering this because of the negative reviews but I figured some people had different preferences than others and it couldn't be /that/ bad. It isn't awful but it's super clumpy and thick. I'd suggest brushing out your lashes with a spooly brush after applying this because of how clumpy it is. It does (very obviously) make my lashes longer but the chuckiness isn't worth it tbh.,3,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I usually like to use Maybelline's Colossal Mascara because it's ""9x volume"" but this mascara beats that by a long shot! My eyelashes are sooo much longer with this mascara! I also usually have to use an eyelash curler to get my lashes up but again, this mascara has been so wonderful so I don't need to use an eyelash curler unless I want my eyelashes to my eyebrows (which I now do). If you aren't sure for it because of the price then please take my advice and take that leap of faith and BUY this mascara! For first use put it on sparingly because a little goes a long way and you don't want it to get clumpy. I will definitely only be buying this from now on!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"This mascara does lengthen lashes nicely, but I find I need to squeeze the brush through a tissue first, otherwise WAY too much product is deposited on the lashes and it end up looking like spider's legs. lol But for the price, I can live with having to take that extra step.",3,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Developed a bad eye allergy wearing this mascara. I’ve never had issues with trying new mascara brands before, so I’m not sure what the problem was. Just to be sure, I stopped wearing it for a week, then tried it again and the same thing happened. Not sure about the ingredients. Had to throw it out this am. Guess I’ll stick to brands I know!",2,0,B00T0C9XRK

If you at all rub on your eyes throughout the day don’t get this mascara. I have walked around for the last several days with mascara smudged on my face until someone said something or I saw my reflection. My old mascara flaked a bit but this is hard to get off once it’s on the skin.,3,One,B00T0C9XRK
Mascara needs sufficient drying time. I apply in thinner layers multiple times for optimum outcome.,4,One,B00T0C9XRK
"I really want to love this mascara because it really makes my lashes stand out but after a short shift at work, I'll look in the mirror and see that the mascara has made it's way under my eyes, almost every time. I don't sweat at work. There is no good reason why this has to smudge under my eyes. It makes me look like I have bruises under my eyes. Had to switch to another brand.",3,0,B00T0C9XRK
After seeing all the pictures I was excited to try this product for it's lengthening ability. Nothing. My lashes actually look shorter than without mascara. I'm going to try it with another applicator brush to see if that helps any but I doubt it will. It's a nice cheap mascara if you just want a little color.,3,0,B00T0C9XRK
I absolutely love this mascara!!

"First off, I am truly amazed at how much volume and length this mascara gives my lashes even more than my usual go to volume mascara Maneater by Tarte. I will say that you truly do not need much or go over the lashes a bunch of times because it will start clumping quickly.
However, after 3+ hours of wearing, it is does continuously smudge/run under the eye if you do apply the mascara to your bottom lashes. This happens even if it is applied lightly to the lashes (which is what I do), so this was a big no no for me. Going forward, I will probably continue to use it just for my top lashes alongside my L’Oréal voluminous.",3,0,B00T0C9XRK
"This product is terrible. I’ve seen so many good reviews on Buzzfeed and some morning news shows raving about it, so I gave it a try, and it was a huge disappointment.

To add to all that, it’s difficult to take off.",1,0,B00T0C9XRK

"This product was recommended on social media. I've used Maybelline Great Lash for years and think it's a good product. I was told that this one makes your lashes look extra thick and long, and it definitely did not disappoint. I have the advantage of having fairly long lashes to begin with, but this definitely made my lashes look longer and thicker than any other mascara I've used. The only problem with it is it's not easy to remove (It's not waterproof though). If someone can recommend a good mascara remover, that would solve the problem. I've always used the oil-free Maybelline makeup remover, but it doesn't work as well on this mascara. I would definitely give this product a try.",4,0,B00T0C9XRK
Wow. Wow. Wow. This is the best mascara I have ever used. I have thin short lashes and every mascara that says it extends and thickens to look like false lashes looks caked and clumpy on my lashes.

After trying it over a 2 week period just to make sure it stayed consistent every time I wore it, I bought 5 more! This is the best mascara I have ever used! It really makes my skimpy lashes look full!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"What a piece of crap! Looked so great when initially applied. Long, beautiful lashes and then...30 minutes later I look in the mirror and I look like a panda. I wipe off runny mascara from my lower lids and an hour later again. And the again and again. I’ve been wiping it from my lower lids all day.",1,0,B00T0C9XRK
"This is my holy grail, I seriously swear by this mascara. I’ve spent years using better than sex which retails for about $25 a tube. When I came across this and saw the results I immediately forgot about any previous products I’ve used to obtain long volume lashes. If you haven’t tried this yet you need to. A must have in everyone’s makeup collection!",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I love this product! I have been using the same mascara that I thought absolutely loved for years, and decided to try this product on a whim and I will never use anything else!! The first day I wore it my coworker asked if I had fake eyelashes on, then she ordered it herself and loves it too. Without being waterproof it stays in place much better than other non waterproof products I’ve tried. If for some reason it smudges, it’s easy to wipe away/correct, and it’s also easy to take off without the harsh make up removers. It give my lashes the most length and volume without clumping and reapplies well if I want to add more.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I have tried both the regular and waterproof a few times now and so far I love it! I have been on a hunt to find my perfect mascara and these may be it. I have bought over 15 new tubes in the last couple months and every one has not worked whether it was, loved the look but smubged and flaked within a short time or did a so so job for length and volume but stayed well. These so far have done both Oooo and the curl!? Yyaaaas! I've never had a mascara that actually helped my lashes curl and actually held that curl for hours! Yay!! Try it! 😁",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
Looove love love this mascara. So inexpensive and really works. A little goes a long way. It did transfer a bit to my cheek from lower lashes and eyelid from upper lashes. I’ve since purchased a multipack because I love this mascara so much!,5,0,B00T0C9XRK
This mascara has a great balance of smudge prrof/ durability while still being easy to remove. Im really impressed with this mascara especially considering the price!! My only complaint is the wand is pretty long which can make it difficult to navigate turns in your eyelid and lashes.,5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"Maybe the most lengthening mascara I've ever used, which I was really excited about, but it definitely smudges under my eyes way more than other mascaras I've used. I didn't even put it on my lower lashes. I got sick of looking like a raccoon so I switched back to my go-to Loreal Lash Paradise :/ maybe the waterproof version would be better?",3,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I didn’t order water proof because for me it is too difficult to come off of my barely there eyelash’s. The mascara was used for the first time today and I was very pleasantly surprised how good the quality is for the price. For the price, can’t beat the product received. Will be ordering it again.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I'm a Tarte devotee, with my drugstore mascara favorites solidly in second place. I tried this because it was recommended in a facebook group and it was a lightning deal, and it's fantastic. I didn't want to love it because I already have favorites! The wand/brush are firm and separate well and the formula is thick and super lengthening. It's easy to apply several coats, especially if you separate with a spoolie in between. Will be repurchasing.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"This mascara is awesome!! My lashes look bomb! Long, luscious and voluminous. I have tried many other mascara (like a lot) and a coworker had told me about this one so I looked it up and said what the heck it’s cheap well .... I’m so so glad I did I’m going to order more and gift them to my friends! Yes it is that good !! I can’t wait to try all of them !! Btw I tried the green one..",5,0,B00T0C9XRK
I would not recommend this mascara. Within an hour or two of wearing you’ll have “raccoon” eyes. At first I was wondering why I kept getting this darkness under my eyes and after a few days I realized it was from putting the mascara on my bottom lashes. It smudges into the bottoms and crease of my eyes. I have a full tube that is going to be wasted because I refuse to use it anymore.,1,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I loved this mascara. It lengthened, added volume and went on smooth as silk. However, I was hugely disappointed with how soon I was wearing the mascara under my eyes. Racoon eyes as they say. So the second day I chose to wear on top lashes only hoping that might help. No improvement sadly too say. I don't even have long eyelashes either! Sadly too say, I threw it away. Wasn't worth walking around with racoon eyes after the first hour. So very disappointed.",3,0,B00T0C9XRK
Definitely gave my lashes more volume. Easy to remove with baby shampoo. Great price. I'll buy again!,5,One,B00T0C9XRK
Makes my lashes look more like false ones. Looks very good and stays in place on a hot day. Removing this will require some extra eye makeup remover. Takes a bit to get it cleaned off. Not enough to be bothersome. Lashes really pop and full.,5,0,B00T0C9XRK
"I've tried many different brands and types of mascara over the years, but this is probably the worst one I've ever used. I gave it a shot several times over the past few months and at this point, I can say with certainty, that it just plain sucks. The quality that makes this mascara so bad is that it is SO sticky and it STAYS sticky all day. It doesn't just make my eyelashes stick together, which happens with various mascaras, but it makes them stick to everything. This mascara makes my eyelashes clump together, stick to each other, and even stick to my eyelids. There are no redeeming qualities either; do not buy.",1,0,B00T0C9XRK
"This is amazing - especially for the price! I have really thin/short lashes. This mascara does an amazing job of lengthening. Not so much thickening, but that’s okay. I wear contacts, & have not had any trouble with flaking, etc. I will definitely buy this again!",5,One,B00T0C9XRK
I don't care how voluminous this makes your eyelashes look... It's a huge pain to remove. I usually remove my mascara with water and facewash in the shower and this was impossible to remove. I had to use eye makeup remover- this should be labeled waterproof. It does give a voluminous finish to lashes at a great price but not worth the hassle in my opinion.,2,One,B00T0C9XRK
"This mascara makes your lashes big with the first application. I love it. I've tried many upon many mascara's over my 50 years and I didn't know if this mascara was going to work or not.Good price, so what the heck, I'll try it with the free shipping. First off, I love the bottle and how the lid feels.
My first application I was shocked it applied so smoothly and my lashes got longer. I let them dry and applied the second coat and wow! Thicker & longer. After doing the second coat, without putting it back in bottle for more mascara, I just took the brush and applied on the top side of my lashes. I recommend this. Just bought my 2nd one.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK

"Definitely adds volume! And you don’t need to apply but a couple times. I have had some smudging but could be my lotion. Stays on all day. I will be buying this again. I would say it’s a good dupe for Better then Sex mascara. If you love drug store dupes like I do, your going to love this.",5,0,B00T0C9XRK

"I do like this mascara, it lifts my eyelashes without having to use an eyelash curler. I like that it doesn’t have a strong smell because I don’t need my mascara to complete with my perfume. It goes on good and I’d give it five stars if it didn’t leave smudges below my eyebrows. Other than that, it’s a nice mascara.",4,0,B00T0C9XRK
I used this Mascara for over a year and loved it. The last two I received where super clumpy and my friend that uses it too agreed with me. Not sure if they changed something in the formula or if they were just old but not purchasing again,1,0,B00T0C9XRK
This is inexcusable! There’s a certificate right on to of the package but yet a hair is intertwined on the very first mask.,1,42,B08HMDH2YD
"This Gleeporte face mask are an excellent value, here where I live masks are required everywhere, grocery stores, hardware stores, restaurants, banks, well every single place that you can imagine.

These masks came in a box of 50 but they are packed in multiples of 10, so there are 5 plastic bags of 10 masks each inside the box.

They are comfortable to wear for extended period of time, stay well on my nose, lightweight and don’t fog our glasses, the elastic don’t bother either.

Overall excellent masks. Highly recommended",,18,B08HMDH2YD
These are the standard non-surgical masks that jumped in price last year due to shortages. Finally available again at the usual basic price. Please get these so you can properly dispose of your masks when they get wet or dirty. I have seen people who re-use masks that are brown and deteriorating. Worse is when they turn them around to wear the soiled side towards their face! This is a really BAD idea. Wear your mask properly and replace it often.,5,12,B08HMDH2YD
"These run small. They are very tight around my ears and my teenage daughter’s ears. They fit my younger kids great, so I’d say they are not adult size. Very disappointed.",3,13,B08HMDH2YD
"Very good quality standard blue masks. They are very breathable yet provide the needed protection. Have not had any issues with the elastic snapping off or the wired nose piece falling out like many other cheap ones. They passed the ""blow test"" or some call it the ""match test"" and I was unable to blow out a flamed match while wearing the mask. Elastic fits comfortably around the ears. Can also fit kids faces if you tie a tiny knot in the string, but also fits large faces with beards. Very versatile!",,11,B08HMDH2YD
"The masks aren’t as they are advertised, The ear loop is very cheaply made they break very easily, The mask itself are very good light weight, However keep in mind they are made in CHINA",1,12,B08HMDH2YD
Great product but they smell like old basement. It’s not very pleasant but I’ll take the smell over the other options any day the smell however does go away after wearing the mask for a while.,4,4,B08HMDH2YD
This is such a great value on this current necessity item. There are 50 3 ply disposable mask and they are separated into packs of 10. Breathable and lightweight. I like tying the earloops for a better fit and these also have the metal nose piece. So happy to find these right now!,,3,B08HMDH2YD
The masks had a foul odor. They smelled as if they had been sitting for awhile. They smelled like mold. I didn't want to waste time and energy on a return. I just won't be a returning customer.,1,2,B08HMDH2YD
"These masks are comfortable and lightweight. They're easy to put on and stay put without hurting my ears. The price was great and they are perfect for keeping in the car or in my purse so we always have access to them wherever we go and don't have to worry about washing them once we're done wearing. I'm all for convenience, especially when the world is a little disrupted at the moment with what our normals are.",,One,B08HMDH2YD
"Oh dear when i ordered these masks i was scared the price was so low, yet somehow the reviews were good. I took a leap of faith and i have no regrets. These masks are perfect the ear loops are really stretchy and don’t break easily. And the mask does not feel cheap, it’s pretty thick and feels protective. I love it.",5,One,B08HMDH2YD
"The mask seem fine/look fine. The are very similar to others I have purchased. The only issue I have is with how the boxes were shipped to me. A bag was used, therefore the boxes arrived all bent and falling apart at the seems. The only reason this is important to me is because I like to store the mask in the box they came in. I had to tap up and ""un-flatten"" sides of the boxes to make them ok to store the mask in. I don't know why the boxes weren't sent in a box knowing how delicate the boxes are.",4,One,B08HMDH2YD
These face masks are handy to have and convenient as after use they can simply be discarded. They fit very comfortably and fit over my nose and mouth well. The ear loops help it to stay in place and also feel comfortable. The mask is breathable and gives protection from dust particles while working outside or for wearing out in public.,,2,B08HMDH2YD
This was the worst purchase I have made. Thse masks are no good. They fall apart as you are putting them on. The elastic is not properly attached and it just falls off. The material is shabby and fors mot feel comfortable . I had to go to the pharmacy to buy a supply. This was money wasted. I would lile to return them.,1,2,B08HMDH2YD

Waste of money. As we are traveling and don’t have any other replacement option available we have to tie them back to be able to wear...",1,One,B08HMDH2YD
Very uncomfortable. I am a woman with a small to average size face and these masks were the most uncomfortable mask I have worn. The adjustable metal nose part does not stay cinched so the mask kept falling down my nose. Really frustrating. Maybe good for children but definitely not adults. That being said the straps are strong and they mask is on the thicker side.,1,One,B08HMDH2YD
These masks are very poor quality- the nose wire is hard to adjust and does not form well around my or my husband’s noses. The straps break very easily when putting on or adjusting mask. Would not buy these masks again even if it they are most cost efficient (cheap).,1,One,B08HMDH2YD
"Unfortunately, I had to return the masks that arrived due to a strong smell that gave me a headache, and made me feel nauseous. They were thinner than I expected which might explain the great price!

I ordered these masks for work. Received them last week and just opened them this morning. As soon as I put the mask on I knew they were a mistake. My face broke out into this horrible rash and I had to chance into the cloth one you see in the picture. These masks are extremely irritating and itchy. The rash has lasted a full 13 hours and still going. I don’t recommend if you have even semi sensitive skin.,1,2,B08HMDH2YD
Smells irritating,4,0,B08HMDH2YD
They were great,5,0,B08HMDH2YD
They keep breaking,2,0,B08HMDH2YD
During this pandemic I go through about a box of these masks every two months. It’s important to keep a bunch in your car and in your purse or pockets when you’re out and about in case you feel like someone has coughs near you or you were entering a new building and you like to switch out your mask.,,9,B08HMDH2YD
With this virus sticking around and it spreading like wildfire I am keeping a good stock of masks on hand for every time we leave the house. I ordered this box to store in my car so I always have a mask with me. They fit my face well and dont cut in or irritate my ears at all. I am considering ordered a couple more boxes to keep handy. Unfortunately I dont think we are going to be mask free for a very long time. This pack is a great option to keep yourself and your family safe.,,3,B08HMDH2YD
Not sure how much real protection it gives because I can breathe easily through mask. The 90 or top of line masks I had trouble breathing through which means to me they were offering much better protection than these....,5,2,B08HMDH2YD
"Good value for the money, but the mask's material is not as soft as other disposable masks I've tried. If you intend to wear them for a short period of time they're fine. I wouldn't recommend them if you have sensitive skin.",3,2,B08HMDH2YD
"This mask is soft and perfectly matches the size of my face. I use it outdoor and use N95 in close public areas. The only unperfect part is that it is not so stretchable, so my ears feel a little bit painful if I wear it for too long time. Overall, it is a good mask, thumb up!",5,3,B08HMDH2YD
"The shipping was fast. The masks are of good quality. Very satisfied with these masks. Good price also. I would definitely tell friends to order them.
Thank-you.",5,2,B08HMDH2YD
They are masks seem no better or worse than others I have used. Wish Amazon drivers would quit saying they handed then to a resident when they are actually just put the package on the sidewalk outside the door.,4,0,B08HMDH2YD
"Poorly made elastic doesn't fit securely, too loss.",1,One,B08HMDH2YD
PAct perfectly. I am sure they will be fine but I haven’t worn them being they were just received Yesterday. Arrives in a carton and the masks are each an individual boxes of 50.,5,One,B08HMDH2YD
Great masks and such a necessary item now. Love how they form to your face and reduce the fog i get in my glasses with other masks. Very breathable while still being safe from contaminating others or catching other contamination,,2,B08HMDH2YD
The masks came looking great but when I put it on it smells like a dirty rag kindof like stagnant water on a kitchen rag I'm sending them back,1,One,B08HMDH2YD
"These masks fit nicely. The triple layers are perfect for protection from germs, but the masks are still light weight. Great value for the amount that we paid.",5,0,B08HMDH2YD
Ok,5,One,B08HMDH2YD
Excellent facial mask. Can’t beat the price on this mask and you cannot go wrong. They fit well do not have any type of chemical smell. They are perfect!,5,One,B08HMDH2YD
"Upon opening them up and comparing them to my other 3 ply, these are not what they should be.

Very disappointed.",2,0,B08HMDH2YD

"I thought that it was a decent deal, but upon opening the packages, I have found, that the NOSE BRIDGES are NOT present in every mask!!!

Every other mask seems to have one, but NOT EVERY MASK!

"Fit poor, elastic not tight enough and fits loose at nose, glasses fogged up constantly even with my face bracket. I wish I had tried them before my refund window was closed. I used two and threw them away.",2,0,B08HMDH2YD
Perfect for double masking,5,One,B08HMDH2YD
"Per the description these have a metal strip to press around the bridge of the nose ""press the metal strip around the bridge of your nose"". It was clear after using one that the ""metal"" strip did not hold its form well when you bent it. The strip felt like it was plastic and as my photo shows it is. Mask does NOT provide a secure fit around the bridge of the nose.",3,0,B08HMDH2YD
"The masks are your typical disposable ones. They seemed well made and the ear loops were well secured. The box and packaging appeared new. However, the masks had an old moldy musty odor like they were stored in a damp basement. I wish they worked out because they were such a great deal.",3,0,B08HMDH2YD
These masks are three layers thick and perfect for double masking with our fabric masks. Easy to breathe through and inexpensive. In double mask situation they trap moisture and reduce glasses fogging,5,One,B08HMDH2YD

The metal part for the nose isnt even centered. Wasted money!",1,0,B08HMDH2YD

"This mask is total trash. 2 out of 3 just breaks as soon as you try to put it on. It's so stiff that you have to adjust it to fit your face using your both hands. It doesn't bend! Also, the nose strap does not bend exposing you to contaminated air. Don't gamble your life for a few dollars and just get something better. This has unacceptable quality. I guess you get what you pay for.",1,0,B08HMDH2YD

One earloop broke as soon as I took it out of the box. The next one I tried the ear loop broke as I was trying to put it on. I got the third one on but it was so thin I could feel my breath going through it just by breathing. These are worthless. I wish I had opened the package earlier before the return window closed. These are going in the trash.,1,0,B08HMDH2YD

These wipes clearly have mold. I opened a new package & pulled out 2 wipes with black spots. I've been using Neutrogena for years and really disappointed that this product now appears to be contaminated. Don't buy anymore.,1,204,B00U2VQZDS
"I originally gave this 5 stars and wrote a glowing review. I was so excited after my first use because it made my skin so soft..but then 24 hrs later I developed severely itchy,dry,burning eyes and a red rash all over my face. I googled “allergic reaction to neutrogena wipes” and omg is it bad..SO MANY ppl have complained about this product causing allergic reactions..why tf are they still selling it?!",1,161,B00U2VQZDS
"These are very strongly fragraced! Yes, they removed makeup, but now I cant get that smell off me and my face feels VERY dry. They also leave an oily residue on my skin and my fingers where I touched it. I washed my face and hands but I can still smell it.",1,111,B00U2VQZDS
"... and has never felt this great! Smooth, hydrated, clean. One wipe removes all my makeup: foundation, 24-hour lipstick, and eye makeup. No matter how late it is or how exhausted I may be, I'm ready to apply my lady potions or just go to sleep. Smells delightful, too.
I gave up the Ponds wipes for these, and I thought Ponds was the best ever!
I don't have the problem some users report, of the wipes drying out because the package doesn't seal. I have a package in every room AND the car, so they're in use for a long time. I just make sure not to touch the wipe to the closure of the package. If I do, I just dry it with a tissue. As long as the package stays dry, it will seal.",5,114,B00U2VQZDS
"The moment I used this on my skin, it felt like my skin was burning.
Since I've been using Neutrogina product, I had strong feeling that it was gonna work.
It didn't.",1,96,B00U2VQZDS
"I've only been using makeup wipes for a couple years, but have tried a bunch of different ones and keep coming back to these. They're big and don't leave an oily feeling like other brands do. These are just perfect and everything I need. I'll probably be using these forever :)",5,88,B00U2VQZDS
One of my neutrogena bags was completely ripped rendering it useless since the towelettes were all dried out. 3 stars because I’ve used the product itself many times but I had purchased those from drug stores. The item is ineligible for return so I can’t even do anything about it.,3,84,B00U2VQZDS
"These are great for removing light or heavy makeup. It doesn't leave a lot of oily feel behind, but I also wash my face after removing makeup to make sure all of it was removed and no gross film is left on my face. It easily comes off and you don't need to scrub super hard with it to get results.",5,69,B00U2VQZDS
These are amazing !!! I’m a teenage girl who LOVES to do crazy makeup looks just for fun all the time so I always need to have makeup wipes with me. I ordered these because my old ones burnt my eyes (Yes to cucumbers). First thoughts were that they arrived on time and in perfect condition. First time I used one of these wipes it was to remove a LOT of makeup and these definitely did the trick! It didn’t take a lot to remove all the makeup just soft swipes and one wipe removed all of the makeup. These are very gentle on the eyes so I didn’t experience any type of burning which is great since I have very sensitive skin! Not only was I already happy with these but the next two days I realized the benefits it brought to my skin! My skin was way more softer and definitely was the most Hydrated it had been in a while. Love these makeup remover wipes and will be buying them again! Definitely recommend 😄,5,42,B00U2VQZDS
"I have tried many different makeup removing wipes, but it does not matter how expensive the other ones are, Neutrogena wipes are the best. They really remove any makeup without too much effort, leave my skin feeling great and do not bother my eyes. I am definitely sticking with Neutrogena.",5,38,B00U2VQZDS
"I typically am hesitant to use any facial wipes, and even have to be careful with face wash due to my dry, sensitive skin. Cheap makeup wipes burn my eyes and make my skin feel dry and taut, but these actually make my skin feel moisturized and amazing. I actually look forward to using them before bed because of how quick they are and how smooth they make my skin feel. Super light scent, too, not overpowering at all!",5,33,B00U2VQZDS
"Love these! My only issue is I can see I'm going to go through these like.... well other wipes you'd use elsewhere LOL.

Their great for a lazy night of cleaning your face. I use this as a 3 part tool taking off my makeup. I was tired of bleaching my washcloths b/c my makeup stains the fabric. I use these wipes first, then some Micellar water then follow by normal night time washing & moisturizing. These don't dry out your face. If you're using them to clean up an error, it doesn't wipe the entire area so you have to reapply. Targets just where you wipe.",5,31,B00U2VQZDS
"These smell terrible, are greasy and caused breakouts on my middle aged skin. The only redeeming quality was that they did remove makeup very well. But the aftermath and smell are not worth it.",2,35,B00U2VQZDS
"Wipes were dried up. Threw out. Too expensive to buy, then to toss away unused is a waste of my money.",1,37,B00U2VQZDS
"Added ""scent"" was overpoweringly strong. One use gave me the feeling of just smearing another set of chemicals around my eyes that I also had to work to wash off. In fairness, I had intended to order the scent-free, so the problem was on me. Unfortunately, into the landfill they went.",2,41,B00U2VQZDS
These wipes are moist and my face feels refreshing after use. Recently my skin becomes red and feels irritated after using the wipes. I will stop using these for now and maybe come back to them later.,3,33,B00U2VQZDS
"Perfect for removing make up. I just moisten it a little more, and with just one towel I can get it done. I used to just wash my face with a cleanser, but now I do this first and it takes away most of my make up. I still use the cleanser and a plastic brush, but that is my routine.",5,32,B00U2VQZDS
"Based on reviews, seems like this product is very hit or miss. It was a definite hit for me. Nothing wrong with it at all. Sufficiently damp and didn't get any dry sheets at all. Took makeup off pretty easily with no additional rubs. The scent is fine for me.

Vote HELPFUL if my review helped you at all. It'll encourage me to keep writing!",4,6,B00U2VQZDS
"It removed all the paint and makeup from my CRAZY halloween looks. I used my spin brush after, and there was little to NO makeup or paint on my spin brush. I love these wipes. Will be reordering",5,9,B00U2VQZDS
"I always use makeup wipes but they are only my very 1st step at removing makeup and starting my skincare routine. These stores take off almost all of the surface makeup that's visible with the eye and they are clean, beneficial ingredients for the skin. I go through more wipes than I would like, because I also take to the gym, on outside Activities where I know I'm going to sweat, so I was ecstatic to find this 2 pack at this price and it's on my Subscribe and Save. It does exactly what I want.. Gently remove makeup workout being rough on my face, remove built up oil sweat, Makeup after a vigorous gym session or just on hot days when I'm spending a lot of time outside. They have not had any negative traction to my skin. My skin stays smooth, hydrated, glowing, and even. These are a repeat buy always!",5,3,B00U2VQZDS
"I was about to order again and saw I didn't leave a review last time sooooo..... Let me tell you ! First off i am 50 years old and Hands down this is the best makeup remover I have tried ,it leave your skin soft and moisturize, it take off all my waterproof makeup with ease, even my waterproof massacre that soap and water don't budge, I have used this brand for years and I have tried other brands and nothing would work as well as these ,my eyes never burn after use nor dose my face burn or itch it only feels soft and clean , this is my second order from this company and the package has been in perfect condition ,OK now with that said I must go order some more because I ran out 😁 I hope this help enjoy you day!",5,2,B00U2VQZDS
"I love these makeup removers!! Until I got these I would only wash my face with soap and wipe real hard around my eyes to remove my makeup (ouch!). I’m so silly for not getting these sooner! I love when I travel and they have the little travel sizes ones in the single packet in my hotel room. I wish I could by these in bulk to throw in my suitcase!

Also, wanted to mention, I’ve seen some videos online of people having reactions to these. I work with a company that sells preservatives to water based products including personal care products. I can tell you that there is always going to be a very small percentage of the population that is going to be sensitive to something. It is no way common and the testing involved in selling something that goes on human skin is intense. So take that into consideration!",5,3,B00U2VQZDS
"I'm gonna be honest here, I have tried multiple brands, scents, skin type-specific towelettes and none of them come close to these. They are soaked in makeup remover, they don't burn my eyes which is the most important thing after removing all my makeup which it DOES! I only need about 2 maybe 3 of them depending how much makeup I have on. Usually I only need 2 and it completely removes all my makeup. Plus they have an AMAZING scent to them that's not too powerful yet it stays on your face unless you wash it immediately after. Finally, I have VERY sensitive skin and this was gentle on my skin and I love that considering how powerful they are. I'm living for these.",5,4,B00U2VQZDS
"I had to throw these away. They did a fair job of removing makeup. I used them most days and if I was wearing a lot of makeup I followed up with soap and a cloth. However, I found myself not using them because they smelled so much. I didn't feel comfortable putting them near my eyes with so much fragrance so I tossed them and switched to these Honest options. https://smile.amazon.com/Honest-Beauty-Makeup-Remover-Wipes/dp/B07F4JYZNG/ref=sr_1_13?crid=37F20PE69PIJE&keywords=makeup+remover+wipes&qid=1578101757&refinements=p_n_is_sns_available%3A2617006011&rnid=2617005011&sprefix=Makeup+remover%2Caps%2C180&sr=8-13",3,2,B00U2VQZDS
I love these! Each package contains 25 towelettes that are very large and soft and removed all traces of my makeup including my mascara which other MUW removers tend to leave traces of behind because I use lash extending mascara with fibers that attach to the real lash to give it a longer fuller look and these leave your face and neck so soft and hydrated feeling. I have began to use these wipes even on days that I do not even wear makeup because of how good they make my skin feel. I love that these have a fresh clean scent to them that isnt too strong but just enough. Already set up my subscription to automatically send these to me every month.,5,3,B00U2VQZDS
"Neutrogena Makeup Remover Cleansing Face Wipes are adequate but not much more. They take off my basic makeup whether it is a light day's dose or for an evening dress up affair, but not so on my mascara. I have to really scrub and scrub to be sure I have removed my mascara. A hint for others: if they dry out a bit just add a drizzle of water as you close them up and they will be much more full of moisture the next day.",3,One,B00U2VQZDS
"This is a game changer for me. I have combination skin. I get eczema sometimes on my eyelid and behind my ears when I’m dealing with stress or irritation from shampoos with perfumes or dry shampoos. I cannot use soap on my face. I do have a facial cleansing bar that I do use called “purpose”. But sometimes ya just want to use a nice refreshing wipe and be done for the day. I love that it is so gentle and leaves my skin feeling clean and soft without feeling greasy. I usually use a toner as well and then an oil free moisturizer as well, but these are perfect for sensitive skin and my eczema has diminished significantly.",5,2,B00U2VQZDS
"So I’ll start with what I don’t like. The package is a cheap resealable closure so wipes dry out in under 2 weeks after opening. If you do experience the dry wipe issue, a simple 2 seconds under the faucet to remoisten does the trick. They are kind of large for just removing eye makeup and feel like I end up wasting half the wipe. I feel these are most cost efficient when you are removing makeup from the whole face rather than just the eyes. However, it removes mascara and hard to remove makeup with ease. Only leaves a slight oily residue on the skin afterwords. I will definitely be reordering despite the sealing issue.",4,One,B00U2VQZDS
"These makeup removers work good for sure, I just wish they didn't have the slight grain texture and by slight I mean very very slight, the only reason I know it is there is because I can feel it when I clean my eye makeup, my eye lids are sensitive so it rubs them a little raw when I use them on my eyes. Other than that, these are amazing! I definitely recommend.",4,2,B00U2VQZDS
I’m honestly shocked at the number of 5 star reviews this has because it made my skin burn like crazy. At first I thought maybe it just didn’t agree with my skin but my mom had the same reaction. Seriously DONT buy these. My face was red and burning all night. I opted for a cleansing balm instead,1,2,B00U2VQZDS
"Great make-up removal product for everyday home use &for travel. I don’t like all the scented things on my face and this does not have any strong scents. It totally works for removing make up (before washing with your retailer face wash) and even in a pinch does a great job removing mascara. When I travel I take as many as I need and put into a ziplock baggie and pop into my make up bag, so they are super compact. At least once I have travelled, forgetting to pack my regular face wash and these were great, I removed my make up and then rinsed and applied moisturizer.",5,One,B00U2VQZDS
"Will probably repurchase forever unless I stop wearing makeup because these are the best wipes!
Store them face down for maximum solution absorbance.
These wipes are very effective in removing longwear lipstick and eye makeup, as well as makeup left on hairline/neck. Be gentle and dont be too abrasive with them.

Not recommended as sole makeup remover, please double cleanse. Use oil based cleanser/balm on dry skin to remove face makeup first. Then use water based cleanser to rinse after.

Have travelled with these on a long vacation and worked well, but probably use the single wipe packs for shorter trips.",5,2,B00U2VQZDS
"These Neutrogena makeup remover wipes work great - the makeup, including waterproof mascara, wipes right off with a soft swipe. I’ve been buying these for the past 6-8 months and I like that they stay moist and ready for any job. The size of the wipes are generous compared to a couple other brands; they’re not soaked with cleanser to the point of dripping, but have a good balance of cleanser on the size of the wipe. They leave my face feeling clean and soft with no residual makeup or soap.",5,0,B00U2VQZDS
"I love the idea of these (aside from being bad for the environment). They smell good but feel like rubbing fiberglass on my face. AND they make me break out like crazy. I’m almost 40 and shouldn’t have acne-these give me acne. They don’t clean well at all. Great for a freshen up but NOT a replacement for washing your face or any part of your body. (Made my chest break out too!)
Use a wash cloth and water if you must but skip these! Sorry!",2,0,B00U2VQZDS
"These makeup remover wipes are affordable and effective. I've been a long-time user of Neutrogena makeup wipes and these don't disappoint. However, I have noticed that during the pandemic (since I am not wearing makeup everyday), these tend to try out before I can use them all. My guess is they probably stay moist for a few months once the package is opened, but start to dry out with time. I never noticed before the pandemic and this was never an issue, but something to think about.",5,0,B00U2VQZDS
"Sadly I can not use these. I have sensitive skin and these caused me to break out in a rash, also burned my eyes. And I ended up giving the second unopened pack to my neighbor and when she opened them (just days after they had arrived) they were completely dried out. What the heck?

My experience was negative...skin rash, burning eyes, a completely dried out pack, but I'm giving them a 2 stars rating,, because if you're not allergic to them, and you don't get a defective bone dry pack, I can see how these would be convenient. It just didn't work for me!",2,One,B00U2VQZDS
"I've been using makeup wipes for years and while I venture away from Neutragena from time to time (because I find a good deal in TJ Maxx or Marshalls on other wipes), every time I return to Neutragena, I realize how much better they work than the average makeup wipe to thoroughly and safely remove makeup (including black mascara). Now that I know I can order them on Amazon for a really good price, I've added them to my auto-renewal purchases. It really is worth a little extra for such an excellent product!",5,0,B00U2VQZDS
"I like these wipes despite the price! They are super convenient after a long day when I really don't want to wash my face in a formal manner. They do leave a bit of an oily residue on the face, but if I need to, I just dab it with a tissue. They take off even the toughest products I use, just be gentle when wiping your face. I have felt a burning sensation form from trying to scrub too hard, especially by the eyes. I always make sure to fully wash (and usually exfoliate) my skin the morning after using these, just to get the extra ""bleh"" off.
I buy the individually wrapped ones for throwing in my pocket when going out, they work great, but are a bit pricey and I once got one with no wipe inside. Honestly you could take a ziploc bag and one of the big container wipes and have one ""to-go"" just as easily.",4,2,B00U2VQZDS
"I used these wipes once and I never looked back.

They're great for sensitive skin, I don't break out with them nor do I feel like they dry my skin out. Plus, they get a lot of stubborn makeup off without a ton of work. I can wear waterproof mascara or eyeliner and not feel like I have to rub my face raw to get the produtt off.

Although, it is awkward getting eyeliner off my bottom lash line because I'm hesitant about bringing the wipe too close to my eyes. I will say that they never caused my eyes to get itchy, irritated or burned.

You still need to wash your face after using the wipe though because it kind of leaves an oily type of feel.",5,One,B00U2VQZDS
"I love these makeup wipes for my SUPER dry skin and it is also sensitive. I have to exfoliate my skin at least every other day because it is so dry and with regular wipes I need to put moisturizer on after because the wipes dry me out even more. These wipes are so soft unlike a lot of wipes I’ve tried, I can rub hard and not feel any scratchiness. They also make my skin feel SO moisturized not in a thick or oily way so I love them. I use these wipes even when I don’t have makeup on just to moisturize my face after a shower or before I go to bed.",5,One,B00U2VQZDS
"My skin is the most irrational annoying organ ever and seems to break out or rash out if someone looks at me wrong. As a result, I am always so afraid to try any new product in case in wreaks havoc on my skin. I’m happy to say that this does not break me out and is super gentle on my face. It actually sees to have improved my skin because it removes ALL make up and grime/dirt without being harsh. However, I usually use two wipes to ensure face is thoroughly clean. It even removes the famous double wear foundation and for us gals who wear it, we know how bullet proof that foundation is!",5,0,B00U2VQZDS
"I love Neutrogena products so when a friend suggested these makeup remover towelettes, I immediately went to my favorite store, Amazon and not only got a great price, but it is on my subscribe and save, I will never run out. Being in my 70's my skin is changing and is very dry, these sheets remove makeup and leave behind a very light residue of ""oil"" which almost disappears, leaving my face free from makeup (especially mascara) and soft. Love this stuff for travel, you never know what kind of water your will run into on the road and I sometimes leave my face soap at home.",5,0,B00U2VQZDS
"I don't think I have terribly sensitive skin, but holy crap, these dried my face out so badly. I used these on Sunday, and it's now Thursday and my face is still so dry that it burns when I put lotion on. They're also pretty strongly scented. It's not a bad smell, just strong. They do remove waterproof eyeliner, but the way they dried my face out, yikes. I have never experienced this with another product.",2,0,B00U2VQZDS
"I love these make-up wipes! I have been using them for several years now. I always try to get the twin pack, as I travel quite a bit. This way I have a pack at home and one with which to travel. I like that the package can be re-sealed, keeping the unused wipes moist for future use.

My skin tends to be dry. So, these wipes are perfect for me, as they leave my skin feeling moist and supple. They do a good job of removing my make-up in the easiest way possible. I simply take a wipe from the pack and rub it all over my face. Voila! My make-up is off!",,0,B00U2VQZDS
"These remove make up fabulously. I’m an eye make up lover so I often have different products I’m trying. Whether it’s waterproof or smudgeproof these do the job. I’ve tried others or drug store generics, not the same. These are my tried and true. I always have these for at home and travel. I actually have sensitive eyes and these do not irritate mine surprisingly.",5,0,B00U2VQZDS
"These are the worst wipes I have ever gotten. They irritated my eyes so bad. I would take off my make-up at night with these wipes and in the morning I would wake up with red eyes and red in some places on my face. I stopped using them and noticed that I no longer woke up with red eyes or any red marks around my face. Everyone's skin is different, but these wipes did not work well with my skin.",1,3,B00U2VQZDS
Not me! These wipes are the perfect solution. They’re a good size and thick enough to use both sides for cleaning (I’m wear an average amount). I also take them in the car on rode trips even when I’m not wearing makeup for that quick face wipe to freshen up after driving for 8 hours. But my favorite is when I’m tired and it’s really late. I just pull one out and take my makeup off in bed LOL,5,One,B00U2VQZDS
"I love these! I am lazy at night, so washing my face after working out or before bed is a major chore for me, I hate it. These have saved me from that dreaded routine. Yes, I should still wash my face before bed, but for those that are as tired as I am at night or having lazy teens, this is for you! Quick and easy, removes dirt and makeup with ease and smells good.",5,0,B00U2VQZDS
"Only product out there that gently removes all traces of makeup. I use waterproof mascara and it takes all off leaving nothing behind, no residue. Probably not the “cleanest” of ingredients but just cleanse face thereafter and follow up with witch hazel and moisturizer. The towelettes are soft and gentle on your skin no matter your skin type. I always feel refreshed after use.",5,0,B00U2VQZDS
"I have super sensitive skin and of the products I've tried for makeup removal these are definitely the easiest and gentlest and yet somehow just as strong as others. They are definitely great for traveling too because you can just throw them in your bag and go, you don't need an cotton pads or washcloth to use with them. And if you're like me and don't use them often because maybe you don't wear makeup much, if they dry out I just add a little water and they're good as new again.",5,0,B00U2VQZDS
"I bought the handy travel Box and just bought 2 refills and they are totally worth it. You can reuse the cloth if you only use them at night for under your eyes and they last forever and work great for my sensitive skin. I wear waterproof eyeliner and mascara and it comes off in one wipe! I will keep buying. 🤗
Quick 2 day shipping",5,0,B00U2VQZDS
"I really enjoy using this product, but for someone with long eyelashes, it can be annoying to use. The towelettes leave small lent on my long natural eyelashes which is frustrating. For traveling, this type of package is too bulky. I prefer using the small individual packs instead. I do like how my skin feels, refreshing and soft.",4,0,B00U2VQZDS
"I loves these wipes. They are great on sensitive skin and remove my makeup easily.

The only downside is that the packaging is awful. They are in plastic with a sticker that opens with a flap in the front. After opening the sticker two or three times, the sticker loses stickiness and the flap gapes open, causing these to dry out unless you put them inside of a ziplock bag.",3,One,B00U2VQZDS
"These are great for removing ALL of my makeup. They make my skin soft and smooth. They are easy to use and of course, easy to take along on trips. The only thing I don’t care for is the scent. It isn’t overwhelming, it just lingers. I’m sensitive to smells, I can smell EVERYTHING, so it probably wouldn’t be a problem for anyone else. I will still use them and recommend them.",4,One,B00U2VQZDS
"I love these Neutrogena wipes! These are the only ones I will purchase. I have very sensitive skin and these do not irritate my face nor do I feel like they are harsh on my eyes. You also don’t need a million of them to remove your makeup. Plus this is a bonus pack so how can you not beat the price. The only ones I didn’t care for was the grapefruit line of these wipes, these are my go to!",4,0,B00U2VQZDS
I wear makeup everyday. I'm always looking for makeup remover that actually works. These wipes do everything they say they do and more. Lovely sturdy wipes with a wonderful light floral scent. You will receive (2) packages of 50 wipes total. It will last you almost two months. You won't be disappointed. I would highly recommend.,5,0,B00U2VQZDS
My wife uses these to remove her makeup with in the evening after coming home from work. They work great and leave no residue on your face and skin. I occasionally will use one for a quick face cleaning after being in the sun sweating. Cleans effectively and quickly for a clean feel with no stickiness or bad scent. Very nice product.,5,0,B00U2VQZDS
I love these wipes! I have tried many brands and forms of facial wipes and these are some of the best. They stay very moist and don’t get dry like so many others. You just need one and you can get all your makeup off. I really love them and use almost every night. Recommend!!!,5,0,B00U2VQZDS
"I have been using these makeup removing wipes for probably 10 years, and they are the only facial wipes that do not irritate my skin or cause breakouts. These are the first step to my nightly skincare routine, and then I follow-up with a quick rinse before applying my usual cleanser. They gently remove all makeup from my face, lips and eyes.
However, it isn't always strong enough to remove stubborn waterproof mascaras or eyeliners.

I've ordered several times from this seller without any issues so far. Product has always arrived as described without defects.",5,0,B00U2VQZDS
The product is excellent as always. Five Star. As an Amazon Prime member I am tired of receiving orders 5 days late due to Amazon's issues.,1,One,B00U2VQZDS
"I always buy this product, whether on Amazon or a store. Amazon has a better price. But these seem to dry out and I always have to add some water to get the wipe moist. They are a good deal on, Amazon, however, I need to personally find, with in same price range a different make up remover. Because every single time, they dry out. And yes, I close it shut, every time. Then the ""sealer"" to keep it closed up always ""rolls"" then, I have to rig it closed. It doesn't matter what, I do, I have bought this product many times and never learn my lesson on the wipes drying out. I think it's just habit and the price. The price has me being a repeating customer.",3,0,B00U2VQZDS
"I stopped using these because of the waste it creates. It's terrible for the environment.
It does the job and you could maybe have a pack in case you are going out a lot and too tired to take of your make up before sleeping. But there needs to be another option that is better for the environment.
My skin also feels irritated after using these.",3,0,B00U2VQZDS
"I wear heavy theatrical makeup for a renaissance faire. The makeup does a great job at staying on, but as a consequence, it is tough to take off. Generic makeup wipes will not remove it. This is one of the few things that will, and do a decent job of it.

I do recommend following up by soap and water or a shower afterwards, just to get all the gunk off the face.",5,One,B00U2VQZDS
"I’ve been using this brand for a while to take off my make up. After using it, I either wipe or rinse off so that it’s not staying on my eyes and irritating them which has happened a bit in the past if I do not. There’s very little scent which is important for my sensitive sense of smell.",5,0,B00U2VQZDS
"I love these wipes! I have tried a few of the different generic versions and keep coming back to these ones. Nothing else truly can get rid of all of my make up without making me break out – ever. The wipes are really good size, super soft, and stay moist to the very last wipe. If you can get to Costco to get them, that’s your best value. But this is great in a pinch.",5,0,B00U2VQZDS
These makeup wipes work pretty good for my sensitive skin. I don’t think these are the best makeup removing wipes however my skin likes them. I still have problems getting off my waterproof mascara and some of my eyeliners. Often I’ll use these wipes and then have to shower and scrub but at least they don’t make me break out.,4,0,B00U2VQZDS
"Works great. I have rosacea/super sensitive skin, and these don't irritate me at all, and leave my skin feeling good and moisturized after.

I do wish they had smaller wipes. I don't need the whole wipe, so I get four times the usage out of these by ripping in half twice then putting them back in. Would be cool if they were already smaller, but could just be me. Anyway, they work great! Hooked for life.",5,0,B00U2VQZDS
These are probably the best makeup wipes I've ever tried. I remember buying one pack at the store for like $5 but then when I saw this pack for 7 dollars I was QUAKING. ITS SUCH A GOOD DEAL!!! it's 10 to 15 dollars at Walmart but here it's with a good DEAL especially with prime. Doesn't irritate the face and it'd a bet wet at first but it eventually dries. I have legit no traces of make up or verbally small left. I love these makeup remover and their the best in the market,5,0,B00U2VQZDS
Not good.,1,2,B00U2VQZDS
The shipping was very fast and the item was well wrapped. The Neutrogena makeup remover wipes do an excellent job of removing makeup. I would definitely buy this item again.,5,One,B00U2VQZDS
"I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend, she won't use anything else because she loves them so much. She says it's the only brand that will get all of her mascara off, and it looks to do a great job! I use and love other Neutrogena products and love them; and I will say, as I go grab her one at the end of the day, whatever liquid coating they use is very gentle and smells very, yet not too, refreshing. And the results are very good, it doesn't take very long to wipe a full face of makeup off!!",5,0,B00U2VQZDS
"It’s really great to keep one beside the bed on those nights when you feel like you can just not make it to the bathroom to wash your face, takes off everything!!!

Yes it’s really great to keep one beside the bed on those nights when you feel like you can just not make it to the bathroom to wash your face, takes off everything!!!

Irritated my skin! I would definitely not suggest! The equate version is waaaaaaayyyy better!,1,2,B00U2VQZDS
This is not a good product. Burned my eyes and didn’t take off eye makeup. Then found out this item is not returnable. What a waste of money.,1,2,B00U2VQZDS
"The best makeup remover wipes in the world. Honest engine. Thought I was going to say something else? Nope. This is really great stuff. Takes it all off, and leaves a nice clean smelling face. No need to wash it off. Great when you are too tired or drunk to go through a production. And you won't look like a zombie when you face that stranger in the morning. Or whomever. You won't scare the mailman. Use it. It's good.",5,0,B00U2VQZDS
"If you avoid any fragrance, paraben or any irritants this is not for you. I thought it will be okay since I’ll be taking a shower and washing face right after using this product, but I got to the point it was clear it was causing rashes and itchy face. It works great removing makeup for sure! But again avoid this if you have sensitive skin.",2,One,B00U2VQZDS

"i’m no beauty guru, so i probably don’t have the best advice, but these are very effective at getting off makeup. they even fade marker or hair dye stains on skin, though it doesn’t completely go away. i’ve used these for quite some time, and they do their job.",5,0,B00U2VQZDS
"I have tried SO many types of makeup remover wipes and was never able to find a brand that worked for me until I came across these. I've been purchasing them for years, and couldn't be happier.

"I've used these for years to remove eye makeup. Not harmful to eyes. No stinging. Only one towelette run through hot water melts off the makeup easily for both eyes. I do not use waterproof makeup so I cannot attest to that but these have never let me down.

Fantastic for travel as well. No strong scent, easy on sensitive skin. Tried so many other brands and off-brands. Nothing works as well as these do. Fantastic price, convenient shipping to my door.",5,0,B00U2VQZDS

These wipes hurt so bad! I used them 2 times and oh my goodness!!! Dried out my skin soooo much, especially around my eyes and mouth. Literally took my skin off... my skin was BURNING and red!! I DO have sensitive skin, and I just canceled the delivery! They were suppose to arrive today!! There NEEDS to be a warning on this product! Absolutely awful! Hurts really bad. Seriously.",1,0,B00U2VQZDS

"This does a great job of removing makeup. It takes a bit to scrub off the mascara, I use a waterproof kind, but that's more time than pressure. It takes me usually two minutes tops to get completely makeup free. I've used other brands, but this works best for me.

They're very convenient for travel and just around the house. I keep a pack on my nightstand and one in my travel bag.",5,0,B00U2VQZDS

I don't know about then but honestly, for me it feels it looks and it seems to be the original product. I test the one that I bought in the store and the one that I bought from Amazon ; there's no such difference at all. Of course you have to pay attention for the things that you buy from what company you buy from . But that's one for sure it comes from Neutrogena. I love it , it fells amazing , one wipe it's enough to clean my heavy makeup for everyday. And it's a great deal for the amount product that you get",5,0,B00U2VQZDS

My makeup wipes came fine. They weren’t old or anything. I’ve been using these wipes for years now to remove my makeup and I refuse to use anything else. I have used several other wipes and even exfoliating scrubs in the shower but none compared. Sometimes I’d still feel like i had makeup on after using a scrub and I’d use one of these after my shower and it would pick up so much that was missed. It’s the only way I can have my face actually feel clean.,5,0,B00U2VQZDS
Not a fan. These left a film on my face that had to be washed off- kind of misses the point. I used these for about a week straight without washing my face after and had the worst break out I’ve had in years. Back to my Burt’s Bees wipes now and my face is much happier.,3,0,B00U2VQZDS

The fragrance is very light and just one sheet removes all my make-up, including mascara. It leaves my skin very soft and feels like a light moisturizer. Highly recommend!!",5,0,B00U2VQZDS

"Bought 2-pack of Neutrogena Makeup Remover Face Wipes.
You get two packs - each one has 25 wipes.

Quick shipping, too.
I will purchase again.",5,0,B00U2VQZDS
First time I ever used a makeup remover Product as I am very picky as to what I allow to touch the skin on my face. It’s great ! Soft and takes make up off easily. I bought it for when I was in hospital for a month and it is great ! I still use them it’s great for sensitive skin,5,0,B00U2VQZDS

"I used to use these wipes as my only form of face wash. I have since expanded my routine and tried out different types of makeup remover (micellar water and oil based cleansers) but came back to these wipes because they work amazing, take off makeup super fast (even waterproof mascara!), and are so easy / no mess. I do use a gentle cleanser and rinse afterward, but for makeup removal the wipes can’t be beat.",5,0,B00U2VQZDS

"I had been using another product recently and end up ordering these this time around instead. I forgot how good they are. They take off makeup super easy and quickly. No eye burning! I will stick with these from now on. They do leave an oily film, but a quick rinse of the face takes care of that.",5,0,B00U2VQZDS
I like this product. Easy to use to remove your daily makeup. When traveling I put them in a small zip lock bag. Would say they remove about 95% of the makeup. Usually use a Kleenex over my face to remove any residue left.,4,0,B00U2VQZDS
"This make up wipe in general does it’s job but it leaves my face incredibly oily. Instead of feeling refreshed after using these make up wipes, I feel as thought I have layered my face with an excess amount of product that, if I don’t wash off, will clog my pores. Generally after using a makeup remover cloth I wash my face anyway, but these wipes are too oily or too filled with their own product that it does not feel like you are cleaning your face but instead adding product. Otherwise, it takes off makeup perfectly fine and the smell is bearable.",5,0,B00U2VQZDS
I love these facial makeup removers so very much! They make my skin so fresh and clean feeling. My sister gave me a packet of these while I was visiting in Florida and I was so very grateful to use them as I was away from my home where I get regular facials. Many thanks! Carole P,5,0,B00U2VQZDS

"I don't like to wash my face in the evening every night as I already wash it in the morning and I don't want it to dry out. I find these wipes to be a great alternative. I don't wear a ton of makeup, but it easily removes my foundation and blush at the end of the day without any sort of scrubbing or anything at all. They're very gentle and I'd say even a little refreshing because my skin feels clean again. For the price, I think they are a very good value.",5,0,B00U2VQZDS
"I’ll be honest, I was a little worried that these would be a fake/knock off product because the price seems too good to be true (the grocery store near me charges $12 for a twin pack) ... BUT it’s definitely the real product that I’ve loved for years!",5,0,B00U2VQZDS

I have tried many makeup removers and this is by far the best. Takes the makeup off immediately.

I have been using these for years and love them. I will say they only remove about 80-90% makeup because I can use a cotton round with micellar water after I am done thoroughly wiping with them and still see traces of makeup.

I use this instead of brushing my teeth. Its great. I just drink some before work and off I go. My breath stays fresh for hours. But after that my breath smells like I ate a turd for the rest of the day.,5,381,B00495Q5OW
It is a total misrepresentation that this is alcohol free.,1,167,B00495Q5OW
"I like red wine and fruity candies--so sue me. I dislike how these vices stain my tongue, lips, and teeth, especially since I usually consume them in the evening. Of course, I'm not a college student anymore: I brush and floss my teeth with gusto now that I am on my own dental insurance (a retroactive apology, mom and dad). That alone is rarely enough to make my mouth feel clean after a couple glasses of wine and some delightful starburst candies. I'm too concerned with my oral hygiene and mediocre dental insurance to be able to go to sleep with a mouth tasting of toothpaste mixed in with a hint of merlot. This mouthwash helps to break down the sugars, the stains, and leaves my mouth feeling clean. I also like the mild burn--it makes it feel like it's working while slightly punishing me. Self-flagellation via mouthwash.

Even though I haven't had a cavity in 5+ years, I was surprised during my latest dental appointment when both the hygienist and the dentist couldn't stop gushing over the beautiful state of my teeth (honestly, it started to get weird). The only thing that has changed since my last appointment was the fact that I now use an electric toothbrush and this mouthwash. I would bet the toothbrush made the biggest difference, but the mouthwash was probably a helpful addition, too.",5,122,B00495Q5OW
"Love (most) Listerine products and this one is added to the list. Though the original is my favorite, I currently use the orange Ultraclean (fights tartar; tastes like Hi-C) at night and this in the morning (has fluoride; recommended by my hygienist). It tastes fantastic- minty fresh without being artificially sweet- and it works wonderfully. It burns like Listerine, meeting my expectation of it burning like Listerine. The name of my band's next smash hit will be ""Burns Like Listerine."" You're going to love it.

Peace.",5,118,B00495Q5OW
"How does anybody swish this stuff around for a minute. 25 seconds in I want to cry from the burning.

Assuming it doesn't melt your teeth out, your breath will smell fresh afterwards.",5,102,B00495Q5OW
"Did you know by using this mouthwash each day say × 2. It not only keeps your breath fresh, teeth n gums free of bacteria and your throat. No sore throat while using this. I know their is bacteria that can n does collect in the sides far back in the mouth. Some people have these pockets where the tonsils may be. Bacteria can and does collect in these pockets. With repeated use of listerine those days are over. I thought I had strep. Turns out food we eat can without gargling with a good mouthwash will cause the build up. Despite flossing, water pic , electric tooth brush ect.. these lumps of matter are small scratchy n annoying. The throat becomes sore. They are white with a tinge of gray and I'm told common. Dentist recommended. If I don't or skip. They form after a week or two of gargling no more lumps . The listerine brings the bacteria out of its hiding place. Freedom! Btw I don't get a cold ever!!",5,49,B00495Q5OW
"I used this product, switching from my usual go to, since it was highly rated on Amazon. Little did I know that I was about to embark on a week long journey to hell. The mouthwash caused a massive canker sore on my tongue, my gums, cheeks, and tongue all became incredibly sensitive and swollen, my throat got sore, and I developed a 2-day fever. I was unable to eat anything hard or spicy and even a week later there is some remaining swelling near my back molars. The internet leads me to believe it contains SLS and there are many accounts of this causing similar symptoms. Unbelievable that this is allowed to be sold to consumers without a warning. I’ll never be buying a listerine product again.",1,44,B00495Q5OW
"Kind of hard to fault a product that's been around longer than I have. As a kid, I remember the intense burn of this compared to scope and other mouthwash's. 30 years later, not much has changed. Leaves your mouth fresh and germ free as nothing can live through the fires of listerine.",4,25,B00495Q5OW
"Based on the great reviews, I started using twice a day, morning and night, and in the beginning it was great. But after about 2 weeks I started getting multiple canker sores, and the the area underneath my tongue became uncomfortable. I did not think it was the mouthwash causing the problems so continued use. Then I started getting dry mouth and the inside of my lip areas top and bottom became very red and very sore. I stopped using this product and three days later all symptoms were gone, no more canker sores or dry mouth symptoms for over two weeks now. Stay away from this product and I personally will not be using any kind of mouthwash again.",1,11,B00495Q5OW
I am very happy I found this mouthwash on Amazon. It would have cost me almost twice as much at my local pharmacy. It leaves your mouth minty fresh for hours after rinsing my mouth with it. Instructions say do not eat or drink anything for 30 minutes after using. Rinse vigorously for 1 full minute. *Edit:8/18/2020 I just purchased for second time. That's all.,5,9,B00495Q5OW
"I was looking for a good mouthwash that didn't burn as much as the regular (blue) Listerine. I did NOT find that, so buyer beware. However, I do like this overall. I feel that it cleans my mouth very thoroughly, and my teeth feel smooth and sparkly afterwards. (I will admit that i cut this with a little water, as without it, you really FEEL THE BURN!)",5,14,B00495Q5OW
"My dentist recommended me to use this Listerine mouthwash in purple color. But, I don't know what is the white powder remained in the bottle cap. My mouth always feels hot when I use it everyday.",2,9,B00495Q5OW
My Dentist recommended Listerine Total Care Anticavity Fluoride Mouthwash to me. I had been using different mouthwashes that I didn’t realize had no fluoride it them. You can have the benefit of freshening your breath & giving your teeth some love at the same time with this mouthwash :) It has 6 in 1 benefits which are 1.) helps prevent cavities 2.) restores enamel 3.) strengthens teeth 4.) kills bad breath germs 5.) cleans the whole mouth 6.) freshens teeth. True total care! The fresh mint flavor is very nice & fresh. There’s markings on the cap to how much you should pour in. The directions are to swish in your mouth for 1 minute. It is a bit strong so I struggle with the 1 minute piece but I focus on the fact that it’s doing it’s job! It’s best not to eat or drink anything for at least 30 minutes after using. I use after every brush or mid day for a refresher. Using this gives me piece of mind I’m providing my mouth with excellent care. The 1 liter bottle is well worth what I pay & I have this on my subscribe & save list so I save a little more & order with convenience. I definitely recommend!,5,2,B00495Q5OW
"It's listerine. What do you expect? It burns, it's unpleasant, it tastes like you dumped frozen molten lava in your mouth for 60 seconds, but it does its job. And afterward my mouth feels fresh and clean and I know it's great for my teeth!",5,8,B00495Q5OW
"I am usually not a fan of mouthwash but I decided to try some after my dentist recommendation.
I went for this one.
Here is what I like about it:
- Gives a sensation of cleanliness
- Recommended by many dentists
- Not very expensive.

Here is what I like much less:
- Very strong taste of alcohol. If you are not a drinker, it may bring you closer to being one since one of the distaste of non drinkers is the strong feel in the mouth.
- I tried to put it in a an electric floss machine and it reacted weirdly by creating some crust everywhere.
- You should not drink or eat anything 30mn after use and the aftertaste will remain for a while.
- Fluoride can be poisoning if ingested in concentrations higher than 1.0 mg/L. Although Listerine only claims 0.02%, it still considers drinking it to be poisoning.
- FD&C red no. 40, FD&C blue no. 1 are potential carcinogens.
- Most bad breath issues are not coming from dental hygiene but from digestive issues... In clear, listenine may cover the bad scent the same way you could spread menthol on a piece of dung... It may cover partially but not fix the issue.

In conclusion:
I am still not feeling safe using it on a regular basis. Added to the awful feel with it in my mouth, I will keep on flossing and brushing my teeth. It has worked fine for me over the years.
2 stars.",,3,B00495Q5OW
"I have always used mouthwash, but I always bought the cheapest one, or whatever was on sale and/or had a coupon for. A few years ago I got a sample of this ""purple listerine"" from my dentist after a cleaning. The doctor highly recommended the ""purple listerine"" and once I started using it, I never went back to anything else. While this is more expensive than what I used in the past, the price is worth it because it really cleans my mouth and I have without a doubt noticed a difference. With proper brushing, flossing and the use of Listerine Total Care I no longer have peridontal disease, I do not bleed when I brush and my mouth feels fresh, clean and healthy after every brush!",5,3,B00495Q5OW
"Stings but the more I use it the less it stings, so it must be working. I think it has reduced some of my gum inflammation. You're not sposed to eat for an hour after using it according to instructions. Also sposed to swish for a good minute, kind of hard to do when mouth is irritated. I think this could have been a couple bucks cheaper if I bought it in store.",5,2,B00495Q5OW
"I have been using this mouthwash for months now although I have not stopped experimenting with other brands, flavors, etc., I keep going back to this one. After brushing, I rinse with the mouthwash instead of water, but first I use the WaterPick with a little splash 💦of Listerine for taste, brush and then rinse with this wash to finish my ritual. Now I’m addicted, don’t want to be without so I’m signed up for the auto delivery 🚚. It’s all good 😁",4,3,B00495Q5OW
"Initially I brought this due to my dentist recommending me this but also due in part because I ended up getting a welcoming gift from where I got my teeth cleaned and this bottle came with said gift. Albelt, much smaller then the one here. When using this flavor I founded it to be strong at first but overtime I managed to get use to the feeling and the flavor to this as well. To me, I just love the way that the fresh mint flavor feels because it does actually feel like a mouthwash that works and gives you that fresh minty breath whereas the others don't. I have brought this twice but after ended up using the other Listerine MouthWash Cool Mint and I can honestly say that it doesn't like that fresh, strong minty flavor as does the fresh mint one does. So, I would recommend this one.",5,2,B00495Q5OW
"This has lasted me over a month and is worth the money! The only issue is that If your mouth is sensitive like mine, it burns really bad. I would suggest going for a alcohol free one that they offer. I will be trying that one after we use up this one. Makes my mouth feel super fresh and clean!",5,2,B00495Q5OW
"This is very strong product and after just using it for 2 weeks, my gums are peeling. The skin is coming off. Don't use this product it's too strong for gums. Use the blue one that's better that this",1,3,B00495Q5OW
MY BOTTLE OF THIS STUFF CAME UNSEALED. Dumped it down the drain. No seal. They say it has a standard security seal at the top of the bottle. It does not. Do not buy,1,4,B00495Q5OW
"This mouthwash is recommended by my Family Dentist and Endodontist to help maintain my teeth by preventing further tooth decay. Unlike some other mouthwashes, it does not burn the lining of my mouth.

It is very important to me that a mouthwash not burn or damage the inside of my mouth because I am a flutist and a bagpiper. I trust this product to help me because I trust my Dentists implicitly.",5,3,B00495Q5OW
"The product is very misleading. The two pack option is the no alcohol version, but the one pack option contains alcohol, even though they look almost identical. I needed a zero alcohol mouthwash since I am pregnant, and this would've been bad if I hadn't paid attention. They need to be listed as separate products.",1,4,B00495Q5OW
Burned my mouth within seconds of contact. I stopped using it and got a mouthwash with a lesser alcohol content.,1,3,B00495Q5OW
"My great-grandma used Listerine for her breath and for her falsies. It tasted nasty to me. It no longer tastes nasty but it burns so you feel like somehow, it's working. And it does-- mouth feels cleaner, fresher and I don't wake up with morning mouth. All I can ask for AND it's pretty sitting on my sink. As I said, it's Listerine-- I've never been tempted to use any other product. See what early conditioning can do?",5,One,B00495Q5OW
"I eat sardines 3-4 times a day. My breath repulses even my dog afterwards. The final straw was when a coworker said this must stop, I was embarrassed but couldn’t give up the sardines.

"Tasted T E R R I B L E. I wish I listened to the other reviews. The taste I could've gotten through, but the burn, jeez I couldn't it even keep in my mouth longer than 5 seconds. The burn is so bad. I had to spit it out and rinse my mouth again with water.",1,3,B00495Q5OW
I usually use mouthwash without alcohol and tried this product. I felt like burning in the mouth. I don't recommend this product if you are sensitive to dental products. I will not buy this one again,1,3,B00495Q5OW
"I never leave reviews, but some of the reviews that I read for this product were inaccurate! I read a lot of reviews that said the mouthwash would leave a white film on the inside of my mouth, but I haven’t experienced that after 2 weeks of using this. I think some people received a different product altogether, maybe there are two versions? But this Total Care product has been great so far! I don’t use it for 1 minute exactly, maybe a little less? I don’t know if that has something to do with why I haven’t experienced any white film post-use!",4,2,B00495Q5OW
As a recovering alcoholic. Some people get triggers that will send them back down the rabbit hole. My dog would hide the alcohol i have left in the house and when I couldn’t find any of daddy’s happy juice i went for the green listerene. It tasted like drinking green listerene. Not only was I fresh. I was drunkenly fresh. Now it’s easier for me to just brush my teeth since this is alcohol free and I don’t find the color purple appetizing. So i would just feel stupid drinking this one.,5,One,B00495Q5OW
"I have tried a few different brands of mouthwash and i always go back to this one. The flavor it's okay, but i wish they had more options for the total care line. It gets old pretty quickly having the same flavor every time. I feel that the freshness works better at night, although it says that you need to use it in the mornings too. There are other options for total care mouthwash but if the brand is important to you than is a good value for your money. It's a challenge to keep the liquid in your mouth for the whole minute that they suggest.",3,0,B00495Q5OW
I almost buy this produce once a month. This is the second time I noticed some wired thing floating at the bottom.,3,5,B00495Q5OW
"I've used Listerine Total Care for about a year now and it has help me keep good oral health. It's the finishing step of my trifecta of good oral cleaning which consists of flossing, brushing, and finally oral swooshing with this solution. I've noticed that using this solution helps keep my breathe fresh and more importantly help decrease plaque build up in the areas that are tough to floss/brush. I'd definitely recommend to others that's looking for an additional unit in their oral health regiment.",5,0,B00495Q5OW
This brand comes in an alcohol free formula. I thought I was ordering alcohol free formula & bought the original formula. The alcohol stings my mouth & is very unpleasant experience. Love the brand- choose alcohol free formula.,3,One,B00495Q5OW
Feels like my tongue is burning. Cannot even use after first use,1,3,B00495Q5OW
"My family has been using Listerine for years, and it has done a great job in making my mouth feel refreshed after brushing along the way. This Total Care is another level. It not only gives you the fresh breath. It also gives you a clean feeling with your gums, too.

Hard to explain how you feel other than to say it leaves your mouth feeling better than it has before. I love it.",,0,B00495Q5OW
"This is not alcohol free, although it did show up in the search results for that term. The labels look similar between the two.

I don’t see a feature that will allow me to attach a photo.

If you’re looking for the alcohol free label, the text “zero alcohol” will appear in a dark strip below the Total Care line, and above the 6in1 section.",5,One,B00495Q5OW
"This is my favorite mouthwash ever. It stings like hell but if you use this brand you might be used to that already. I recommend this kind if you have braces, a lot of the other kinds have dyes that might stain your teeth at the moment but also ingredients that will linger and give you long lasting, terrible looking stains. I have seen it and I will play it safe with this one.",5,0,B00495Q5OW
"This stuff works very well but I CANNOT STAND the taste... but then again I have never really like the taste of any listerine.
HIGHLY recommend if you actually like Listerine's taste. (Probably one of the better tasting Listerine) but I DO NOT recommend if you can't handle a strong taste. I recommend Crest Pro Health Advanced Clean Mint flavor if you are not a fan of the taste of Listerine. (CPH is also recommended and given out at my mother-in-law's Dental Practice, so BOTH are EXCELLENT)",3,0,B00495Q5OW
"This mouthwash is very strong, although the taste is not bad, every time I use it hurts my mouth, burns my gums, it's uncomfortable, I don't recommend it.",1,2,B00495Q5OW
"This stings quite a bit but my experience is Listerine always does.
I got this to use instead of another brand that cost more. You are supposed to hold it in your mouth for one minute to make sure the fluoride works in all the places between your teeth. It stings so much it is hard to hold it for one minute but I did. I have good teeth and so it must be because of fluoride does keep teeth healthy. The dentist said so.",5,One,B00495Q5OW
This mouthwash has helped end my tooth sensitivity. I use it daily as a mouthwash. Also put it in my battery powered water pic flosser to aid in cleaning my teeth & mouth. Really happy to not be in pain when brushing my teeth.,5,One,B00495Q5OW
Taste is beyond horrible. Not mint. More like grape. So strong it's hard to keep it in my mouth long enough to rinse my teeth. The smell is strong and sucks the air out of the room. Hope the bacteria is equally annoyed.,3,One,B00495Q5OW
"If you want a gentle alcohol free mouthwash, this isn't for you. If you want to wipe out germs, this one does the job. You can water it down if the alcohol is too strong. I do half mouthwash half water before bed",5,2,B00495Q5OW
"Much easier flavor to tolerate. Helped me tremendously. When I had gotten it, I'd had a bad jaw infection, had 2 have 3 teeth removed, ended up w dry sockets that were also infected. Using it helped soothe the area, by attacking the infection & I'm going 2 continue to use it now daily. It's the ONLY thing that makes my mouth feel CLEAN.",5,0,B00495Q5OW
"Maybe I got sensitive tongue, I can’t have it in my mouth for more than 15 seconds. Tip of tongue gets all red and I feel a very burning sensation.",1,3,B00495Q5OW
This is a great deal for the size and cost. I like using it because it overall cuts back on tooth decay and brightens teeth. I have had many comments on how I can keep my teeth so white and really it's just the mouthwash. The flavor is great too and while it may be strong for some people I think that's part of what makes it work so well. Love it. Totally recommended.,5,0,B00495Q5OW
"I ordered this mouthwash at around 6:30 PM yesterday, and it came in at around 1030 this morning. When I used it, my breath still smelled bad. But maybe I should use it again. Maybe I have yet to see good results

"Listerine has a reputation for being a great product to help with oral hygiene. One of my kids has braces - she has been using this to help keep her teeth clean.
Lets be honest. Listerine does not taste good. It also burns a little. However, small trade off to keep your mouth healthy and help prevent cavities.",5,0,B00495Q5OW

It's really good to use. If not every day than at least to substitute brushing in a pinch. Overall it the only mouthwash that has such a high flouride content. Also it has a cool feature in the top to help measure how much to use. Any other flouride mouthwash that I know of is more expensive per ounce and has less flouride.,4,One,B00495Q5OW

"This was an impulse buy, although I've always wanted to try one. I always have bags under my eyes, and often my eyes are puffy. I also have a problem with one of my eyes where (I think) there's something going on with a tear duct, and my eye waters a lot. I had an uncomfortable procedure done on it, but it didn't help. Ok, long lead-in....
I really like this product. It feels really good to us, especially around the eyes. I can actually feel it helping with my faulty duct, and when I use it, my eye is less ""teary."" I like to refrigerate it. The coolness feels heavenly! I chose the rose quartz, as opposed to jade. I used to study different kinds of crystals and i remember rose quartz is said to promote harmony,, universal love, and inner peace. I like the concept; and, to be honest, I was partial to the pink lol! It comes in a nice little box. The box did have a SKU label on the front, but it was easy to remove.

I do wish the directions were more detailed, particularly on how to use the gua sha. However, I found more than enough information and tips on YouTube.

I had looked at a few similar products, but landed on this one because it looked like the best quality for a reasonable price. I'm glad I got it!",5,214,B07WWC3T9Q
"I never review anything this early, but I bought this roller 2 days ago and I HAD to write a review. So I honestly didn’t think this will work much besides massaging the face but I was so wrong! I had botox’ed the frown lines between my eyebrows, and I’m young so I go almost every year and not sooner. Between the botox sessions as the material loses its grip, the lines between brows become a bit loose again and it’s as if you’re naturally half-frowning. I started using the roller 2 nights ago, just sitting by the TV and enjoying its cold feeling against my skin for about 15-20 mins on and off, and naturally I used it on my frown line as well. I was so shocked when I suddenly noticed that the remnants of the botox lines were GONE!!! I kept looking in the mirror and even asked my mom and sister, and they both said it’s gone too! All it took was 20 mins of rolling for 2 nights and I’m even thinking of not going for another botox session anymore! This is so worth it! It feels nice and it ACTUALLY WORKED even though I really didn’t think it would! Great buy!!",5,122,B07WWC3T9Q
Three words....I LOVE IT!!!!,5,118,B07WWC3T9Q
"I've been thinking about getting one of these for awhile. The cheap ones seem to be hit or miss, squeaky and fall apart. But this one seems nicely high quality, comes with great packaging. It feels amazing on the skin. It's NOT squeaky and it seems durable. Can't wait to put this into my skincare routine.",5,100,B07WWC3T9Q
"I use this every night and it feels amazing on my skin. The instructions it comes with really helps when it comes to how to use it and which direction to roll this on your face. Even helps when it comes to using the gua sha. The handle is really comfortable to hold, thought it was going to be awkward but it's really not. Love how this feels on my face and neck. Almost feels as though I'm giving myself a nice massage. I did push a little too hard when using the gua sha and accidentally bruised myself, so you don't need as much pressure as I thought I was going to need. What I really love is how it feels over my sinus, especially when my allergies are acting up.",,89,B07WWC3T9Q
I was hesitating buying this just bc of the price but it’s actually worth it i love it ! and i’ve actually seen more expensive ones but this one is perfect. it arrived fast,5,80,B07WWC3T9Q
"I wanted to give this a try to see how it will effect skin
It is to make it smoother, giving more circulation and less wrinkles. I've been using this for some time now
My face does not look puffy, tired or swollen as it has before. My skin is smoother and softer too. It is easy to use. Use it twice a day to get better results. Roll it over your face in smooth fluid movements.
100% jade. It comes with 2 stones on the roller and one smooth sculpting style stone.",5,68,B07WWC3T9Q
"I previously had a jade roller. It broke after a year and it squeaked while using it from day one. I used it and it was effective, the difference between my old one and this one is the quality and the amount of time it stays cool. I personally recommend anyone over 40 have one in their arsenal of anti ageing skin care. The roller itself is study and glides smoothly. It stay cooler longer than my previous one and it has the added benefit of the gua sha. This was new for me but found it really useful around the jaw line. I often wake up in the morning with a puffy face. After a shower, I use this and am amazed at how quickly it gets rid of the puffy look. If you don't believe me, try doing one side of your face first and you will see the difference immediately. Do yourself a favor and watch some you tube tutorials on how to use them. It makes a difference on the result. HAPPY ROLLING!",5,32,B07WWC3T9Q
"The first minutes out of the box, the roller fell on the floor and the handle section broke in half. That's on me for clumsiness. And I was able to immediately glue it back together with epoxy and it works fine. But be warned, you gotta treat these tools like they're made of crystal because they are.

These tools are relaxing to use. My face does feel like it's had a nice gentle massage when I'm done. I can't call it miraculous or like it's turned back the years, but it's soothing. And soothing is something we all need a bit of right now.",4,9,B07WWC3T9Q
"It came in a secure package with foam and what not, can’t wait to use it but make sure you clean before use because I found some residue on it. *EDIT* update 11/2/20
After a couples of months the metal became brittle and broke off, even the gua shaw broke smh I dont recommend",1,11,B07WWC3T9Q
This is the first time that I used a jade roller I like the concept however my face started to get red and break out a bit I looked online and was told that I was supposed to boil the Jade roller after every use unfortunately that was not in the instructions would be nice for it to be told in the instructions. I finally had to throw the Jade roller away no matter if I cleaned it or put it in the refrigerator I am still breaking out garbage maybe I have to buy a really really expensive one for it to work,4,7,B07WWC3T9Q
Very sturdy and durable! It’s definitely worth spending a little more for the quality. I purchased the rose quartz roller and it’s very pretty!,5,118,B07WWC3T9Q
"I had purchased a Jade Roller from another brand, and the top popped off one day. You could sell it was sloppily superglued on. It also squeezed when you were using it. I saw this set and was excited because a) Rose Quartz is one of my favorite crystals and b) you get the gua sha tool as well. I was pleasantly surprised when I received the box, the packaging is really beautiful and high-end looking. The roller is nice quality, it feels sturdy, and it doesn't squeak when you use it. I enjoy the smaller roller end for my eye area. It does help moisturizer and serums spread on better and soak in faster. The gua sha tool is also great. I can tell it's good quality and wont snap in half. I have been using it on the knots in my neck actually, giving myself a massage and putting pressure on the knots. It's also good for depuffing your face and getting that build up of fluid to drain. This is really great for the money! I recommend.",5,84,B07WWC3T9Q
"This is an additional to the one star review I gave on this product. I received a customer reply letter from, Jade roller, BAIMEI and Amazon ,which explained where to find the Gua Sha piece of jade that I in error thought was missing.
The product is as stated, and is easy to use, and really does relax the face and neck. I thank the BAIMEI and Amazon customer service for replying to my first review. I feel that this product is a 5 star item and makes a wonderful gift.",5,85,B07WWC3T9Q
"I first bought this item and a gua sha stone came with a crack all along the top. It looked like it has been broken, glued back together and packaged up. There were also chips and dirt inside of it. I returned it thinking it’s just defective and I’ll get a new one. My new one came in and was even worse. It had a giant chip out of it with orange clay inside. It’s just not clean. Definitely not worth buying.",1,5,B07WWC3T9Q
"Very cheaply made! I received an already returned jade roller from a previous purchaser.
When I received the package, the safety seal tab on the box had already been broken open. The flat jade piece had a chip out of it and would have sliced the skin to pieces if used. I returned it.",1,5,B07WWC3T9Q
Not sturdy enough for its intended use.,1,9,B07WWC3T9Q
"I had never tried a jade roller prior to this and I am really glad I picked this one up. It is so nice and soothing on the skin, and the gua sha stone is lovely for easing tension in my shoulders. The roller itself stays relatively cool in the cold/winter months even without putting it in the fridge, and my skin feels a lot more loose and tension free after using it in the mornings. I would highly recommend it.",5,82,B07WWC3T9Q
i LOVE this product! definitely a new staple in my skin care routine. it feels like authentic jade and is built well (doesn’t feel cheap or flimsy). i pop it in the freezer before use and it feels like a spa in my own home. the fact that it has a gua sha tool is amazing! i learned about them after i made my purchase and i was so pleased that it included both. it is also by a family owned business which is that much better. i’ve recommended to friends and it is definitely a great purchase!,5,80,B07WWC3T9Q
"So it feels good rolling over your skin, but that’s about it. I dropped it into my sink basin today from my hands - it was about a four inch drop, and it busted in half. So it’s not at ALL durable. The instructions are soooo hard to read. Even with my reading glasses. It’s so tiny. I’m a graphic designer, and the font on the back of the pamphlet giving you instructions is about 2pt. I had to use my camera on my phone to read it. And when I finally figured out what it said, I realized they just copy and pasted the roller instructions for the stone instructions. So there are no instructions on how to use the stone at all. I give it two stars because it felt nice and relaxing when it was whole, but it literally broke from a 4 inch drop and the directions are unusable.",2,One,B07WWC3T9Q

 This rose quartz roller felt amazing on my face! Especially the stress points near the temple and nose. Great condition and packaging. Buy it!",5,28,B07WWC3T9Q

"I keep mine in the refrigerator. My daughter uses hers for face mask application, which works well according to her, but I use mine for when I have bad tension headaches. The coolness rolling over your forehead in a repeated motion really helps relieve some of the pain. I roll it under my eyes where my sinuses are, along with my temples as well, apply light pressure as I roll it. Its a gamer changer especially for hotter weather and a headache hits.",5,One,B07WWC3T9Q
Overpriced and doesn’t do anything for me. I don’t understand the high reviews. I don’t feel and see a difference after using it.,1,4,B07WWC3T9Q
"I was so excited to receive this roller. The moment I took it out of the package, one of the roller ends fell off. Its like they forgot to glue it on! Nothing a little super glue couldn't fix but a bummer to have to wait a day to use it. After fixing it, it works really well and helps relax my tight jaw caused by bruxism and TMJ. If I had know I would need to glue it, I probably would have picked a different brand though.",4,One,B07WWC3T9Q
"Highly recommend the roller and Gua Sha! At first I was skeptical because there’s so many to choose from and different types of rollers. This one is perfect!
I am a first time user of both the roller and Gua Sha and it was really easy to use. The material of both seem high quality and is very pretty. The packaging was also a pleasant surprise because it was in a beautiful case with snug packaging materials. After I used both after watching some demo videos, I 100% felt a difference in my face. More so with the Gua Sha than the roller. I left both in the packaging it came in and store in my refrigerator in a plastic bag. It feels amazing chilled. I love it and am excited to keep using this in my skincare routine.",5,One,B07WWC3T9Q
"I bought this tool to help massage my face when I have sinus pressure. I also suffer from migraines and tension headaches and I find that using this on different points of my face and neck really helps ease some of the pressure. I keep my in the freezer as I’ve read that massaging ice on your face helps with some thing or the other, so I figured it can’t hurt. If I’m already rolling this on my face, I might as well do it while it’s cold. May just all be placebo, but I thoroughly enjoy this little gadget.",5,One,B07WWC3T9Q
"Broke in less than a month, broke completely in half and then the roller fell off of the part that was holding it on and then when I tried to put it back on it would no longer roll smoothly, it was bumpy and painful",1,3,B07WWC3T9Q
I just purchased 2 of these rose quartz jade rollers. One is for me and the other I got for my mom for Mother’s Day. The shipping was super quick! I was worried it wouldn’t be on time for Mother’s Day. Also looking through many others on here. There was a bunch of other sellers with reviews that ended up with the rollers broken during shipping. Mine came completely intact. They were both packaged very well. The colors are a little different (1 is just a lighter pink with white) than the other which I like so we don’t get our confused and makes them unique. No squeaking and rolls smoothly. Price was great.,5,2,B07WWC3T9Q
"I bought this to see if it helps wake my face up in the morning or helps with headaches. If does both! The quartz gets really cold, even when it’s just sitting in the box. I like rubbing it on my face first thing in the morning to help wake me up and when I have a headache I just gently rub it over my face and the cooling quartz seems to release tension. I like it so much I bought one for my friend just because it’s relaxing. The roller does make my eye less puffy when I’m tired too. I’d been unsure if I should buy this before but now I wish I’d just gone ahead and done it forever ago.",5,0,B07WWC3T9Q
THE HANDLE BROKE...ONLY HAD IT SINCE FEB 8.2021....SUCKS PAST THE RETURN DATE,1,4,B07WWC3T9Q
I love it!!! I've been using it everyday since I've purchased. I have noticed a significant difference when I use the gua Sha in the morning it really helps with rebuffing my face. I use the roller when applying my serums and I just love!! I did see some YouTube videos to help me better use the gua Sha and the roller and I Highly recommend doing that. Great purchase.,5,One,B07WWC3T9Q
Used it 3 times max and it came apart... not sure how and now it keeps falling off with any pressure applied. Very disappointed 😔,1,4,B07WWC3T9Q
"Everything came in perfect condition thanks to the packaging. No broken pieces, which can happen a lot with fragile stone like this. The rose quartz is actually better than jade for this roller, as the jade ones are often not made with real jade, and are porous. The quartz is always nice and cool to the touch even without refrigerating it. I love using the roller in the morning to reduce puffiness. Works great and I love it!",5,2,B07WWC3T9Q
This product harmed my face and eye area. It appeared to enhance the wrinkles around my eyes and chin area.I did watch videos on the use but I definitely would not recommend.,1,3,B07WWC3T9Q
I purchased this product last week and dropped it once and broke in half. When I buy something I expect it to last AT LEAST one month.,1,5,B07WWC3T9Q
"I have a $30 jade roller from herbivore and I like this rose quarts one just as much if not more. some cheaper jade rollers squeek but this one is quiet.
Jade rollers dont actually do much for you skin but I use it as gentle massage on the face and to help with lymphatic drainage.
The gua sha this comes with is also very nice quality. I always wipe down my gua sha and roller down with alcohol after every use as certain stones can be porous.",5,0,B07WWC3T9Q
"GET THIS SET! I am schooled at the quality for the price. It’s sturdy, it’s genuine quartz, it’s heavy feeling but smooth and light on the skin. Absolutely floored at the quality for the price and so thrilled with my purchase. I use the roller to massage a thicker vitamin e oil into my skin and it’s fantastic!",5,One,B07WWC3T9Q
"I must say, amazon handled the packing process ROUGH. But the company is truly an honorable and respectable company. They immediately sent me a new box after THEY emailed me as a follow up to the sale. YES they reached out to me first!! I gifted both boxes to a best friend and mother in law. They both (separately) said it was so pretty and fancy!!! I will be buying again! Totally worth it and really beautiful products!! Thank you for your off the charts amazing customer service!!!",5,One,B07WWC3T9Q
"Would have given this 5 stars but my first order wasnt delivered and when my replacement came the roller was broken in half. I was going to return it but after trying it I loved it so much. I decided to super glue it and keep it. Didn't want to wait for another one. My skin is super smooth and looks better than ever. I had alot of acne as a teen and this helped so much to improve my damaged skin. If you are looking for something to help with acne ""damage"" this is the tool for you!",4,0,B07WWC3T9Q
"I am obsessed with this whole product. The packaging is amazing and high quality and the roller and gua sha are also high quality and also very sturdy. I have an 11 month old and she’s thrown both on the floor very hard and neither of them broke. As far as helping my skin, they work really well. I use an oil on my face morning and night and they help press the product in and keep my face glowing and moisturized. I also keep mine in the freezer so they are really refreshing to use on my skin. I highly recommend this product especially for the price, I’ll definitely be buying more for gifts.",5,One,B07WWC3T9Q
I was pleasantly surprised with this product. The roller and gua sha are a beautiful shade of pink and came in simplistically chic box. It made me wish I did an unboxing video lol. I’m always looking for ways to moisturize my skin and I’m completely satisfied with this product. I also love that I can use the gua sha to help relieve tension between the shoulder blades. This product is the perfect gift for anyone who wants to prioritize skin care in your life for a great price. I absolutely plan to give this gift to my sisters this year!,5,One,B07WWC3T9Q
Quartz came damaged and it was not secured correctly so it was falling down all the time. Cheaply made and defective. Do not waste your money.,1,4,B07WWC3T9Q
"Well, we got the package today and The packaging was really nice, thick foam, and it was safely tucked away.. but if you scroll a few reviews before mine you’ll find what looks to be the exact same chips and indents as the one returned..
against my better judgment- I kept it.
I’ve washed and sanitized it .. so let’s see how it works.",3,One,B07WWC3T9Q
My friend uses these things but I honestly didn’t believe this stuff worked. I bought it to give it a shot and it’s absolutely amazing! I use a face mask and I put this in the fridge mean while. Once I remove the face mask I use the roller and it feel so great and soothing on the skin. I feel like my face feels lighter after using this. I usually have red puffy skin so this product definitely makes me feel relieved. I definitely recommend. I still have to try to use it every day to see if it helps me with my bags.,5,One,B07WWC3T9Q
"If you’re debating purchasing, don’t wait any longer! Seriously the best money I’ve spent on a facial product in a long time. I store mine in the freezer and use it after a hot shower or after removing a face mask. It feels so lovely- it’s refreshing and rejuvenating all in the same lil package! My only complaint is that the instructions are a little unclear if you are unfamiliar with Gua Sha and it’s practices. I noticed that some reviews mentioned breakage but inspected my product for any imperfections... none found!",5,One,B07WWC3T9Q
"I think that the package was well made and protective enough. What is wrong, in my opinion, is that the handle is too fragile and will not support the pressure that you make when you roll the roller on your face. The manufacturer could have made the handle in metal and not in quartz. Quarts can easily break and the handle is also thin and long, not the best shape to last.",2,0,B07WWC3T9Q
"There are a lot of beauty tools out there - this gua sha package's little details stood out. The color of the gua sha and facial roller is beautiful and this roller is not squeaky! Very smooth gliding, and I incorporated the tool into my skincare routine easily! I love making time to gua sha, don't forget the neck!",5,One,B07WWC3T9Q
"I'm really amazed this was sent to me in this condition. Clearly the box had been opened before and maybe it was a returned item or something. The sticker wasn't even sealed and half the box was torn apart. Will not be ordering from these guys again. I will say it again too, I'm really really surprised that whoever sent this out thought this was going to okay.",1,3,B07WWC3T9Q

"Overall the product was packaged very nicely and the stones seem nice. Unfortunately, it arrived defective as the small bottom piece is not even attached! It just falls right off. I guess the item never had a quality check before being shipped out. I’m disappointed because I was looking forward to using this item. Not sure yet if I’ll hassle with a return or attempt to glue the pieces together.",2,0,B07WWC3T9Q

My packaging came today and I am very amazed of the benefits this product can do! I wasn't aware of it until I heard the benefits and wanted to give it a try plus the good reviews helped too. I tried the jade roller for 15 min or so on one side since I have puffy eyer like baggy eyes because I work swing shift and I immediately started seeing results. I asked my husband for feedback and he was amazed how in just a few minutes giving myself a massage help to minimize my baggy eyes and no more puffy eyes😊 thank you for this and will continue to do this massage on my face and have more positive results 👍❤️,5,0,B07WWC3T9Q
"Exactly how I imagined it to be when ordering this product! Also came in a nice box and was wrapped up good. Super excited to try my new rose quartz face roller.

Glad I picked this seller even though there were lots of others, so I highly recommend when looking for a face roller!",5,2,B07WWC3T9Q
My gal really enjoyed this small yet effective roller. Equal amounts of mascara and makeup are distributed over your face with equal layering. Easy to store and clean... A must have...........,5,One,B07WWC3T9Q
"I keep this by my bed and try to use the gua sha stone most nights with a bit of rosehip oil on my face, neck and chest. It feels good and leaves my skin feeling refreshed. I don't use the roller much, which is the original reason that I bought it. I have other gua sha tools, but I really like the texture of the Rose Quartz, and mostly use this one now.",4,0,B07WWC3T9Q
Omg! Could this tool be any better?! I feel so relaxed after using this. AND it came with a bonus Gua sha stone! Which my boyfriend and I LOVE! I definitely will recommend this to friends,5,One,B07WWC3T9Q
I have been using this for a little while now. It is real quartz (i tested it) and it is very smooth. It makes no squeaky sounds like some of the reviewers mentioned. So far it has not fallen apart either. I am very happy with my purchase.,5,One,B07WWC3T9Q
"- Ordered on Dec. 11, arrived on Dec. 18.

- a nice gift for lady
The pink color with the rose gold holder is so pretty. They use real Jade, not plastic material. I like the box too. It's a very awesome gift for lady.

- some scrab
It has some small scrab at the guasha, and the two rollers. But I try it on my face, cannot feel them. So it's okay for me.

- after sale service is very nice
Before I ordered it, I checked the one star review. Some customers noted that their rollers broken, or they got some scrab too. The seller replied each complaint. That's why I decided to buy.
They also sent me the instructions through email before it arrived.",4,0,B07WWC3T9Q
"Beautiful, beautiful product. 😱 I just got mine today, and I am already in love with the cooling sensation alone. It’s a little early to tell if it actually helps with fine lines, but as a person who regularly gets tension headaches, this is a miracle! It’s cool to the touch right out of the aesthetically pleasing package, but I definitely recommend putting it in the fridge for 20 mins before you use it. It helps to relieve tension in my jaw and on my temples, and my under eye bags were subdued the first few rolls I tried out under my eyes. Would 100% recommend.",5,One,B07WWC3T9Q
"I got this for my sister for Christmas and it arrived on time with nice packaging. My only complaint is that there was a barcode sticker on the decorative box, which was annoying to remove. But the product is great! I definitely recommend this product :-)",5,One,B07WWC3T9Q
"Exactly what i wanted but....there was a jagged edge around one of the stones that would nip

"It has not only helped my skin look and feel younger, but it has also helped me when I had a sinus infection. TMI but if you roll under your eyes, away from your nose, it helps clear out all the mucus. Great purchase. I have used it every other day and switch with morning and night.",5,2,B07WWC3T9Q
"Don’t waste your money. I ordered these for me and my mom and the packages were filthy when they came, like the box that the roller and stuff was in was covered in filth. On the inside the roller didn’t appear to be very clean either. Returned both.",1,4,B07WWC3T9Q
Wow! I used it and immediately could feel and see a difference. My face and neck feels lighter and relaxed. I use rose toner and I can tell I’ll see more of a difference in my face shape and skin the more I use it. I keep mine and my toner in the fridge. It’s so refreshing in the morning and before bed.,5,0,B07WWC3T9Q
every night i give myself a little spa night with this. i’ve noticed my “anxiety lines” (little indents starting above my eyebrows) have gone away with consistent use. i accidentally gave myself a small bruise rubbing my temples after a migraine as well but that’s user error lol,5,One,B07WWC3T9Q

"Seems to be a well-made product for the price! I purchased two sets of these as Christmas gifts and the recipients loved them so I bought one for myself! However, I do wish the instructions included with the product were clearer. The images are helpful but the descriptions are disjointed and often don’t seem to match with the images. Do yourself a favor and just look up some online videos for usage rather than relying on the instructions. Other than that, the product was excellent!",5,0,B07WWC3T9Q

"I’ll admit that this was a “spur of the moment” and probably unnecessary purchase for me at the time. However, now that I have it, I use it everyday and can’t imagine my skin care routine without it. It really does help reduce puffiness in my face under eyes. I use the rose quartz a lot more than the jade roller but still think it’s worth the purchase if you have been interested in trying one of these!",5,0,B07WWC3T9Q

I love this ! And the package is nice. Maybe try including instruction on how to clean it. I googled it and it said not wash directly with water instead you can use a cloth with cool water and a little bit of dawn. Or alcohol pads do the job,5,One,B07WWC3T9Q

It’s only one thing I like about the fake jade is it still feel good rolling it across my face.",3,0,B07WWC3T9Q
Came in a cute package. Tool is pretty and feels cool on the face. It actually came with 2 items. What a great surprise! Need to find out what the second item is for.,5,0,B07WWC3T9Q

"THIS IS THE BEST THING IVE PURCHASED. I used the gua sha nightly after I put on moisturizer, and then follow with the roller than I keep in the freezer to calm the redness. It has definitely changed my face. Before I had a lot of cheek puffiness, and my cheekbones weren’t super defined. Now my cheek bones are SNATCHED and my face isn’t round and puffy. I will definitely keep using this.",5,0,B07WWC3T9Q

"I recently purchased this because I wanted a gua sha tool and heard that rose quartz is less porous than jade. I have been using a jade roller, and since buying this set, I haven't used it since. The roller itself is very durable and doesn't glides smoothly. There's also no squeaking noise from the sound of the metal hitting the roller thanks to the added protection. Can't beat this!",5,0,B07WWC3T9Q
I have been using it for a month and I love it. I was afraid that it would not last because of how inexpensive it is but its actually a really good quality it doesn't squeak or gets stuck as it rolls. I like to keep it in the fridge so it can feel more refreshing when I use it. So far it's a great tool to massage the face.,5,0,B07WWC3T9Q
The packaging is very nice and protective. I really love the set except one of the rollers on one side is flat so it is a little weird luckily the large roller is completely round.,4,0,B07WWC3T9Q
I have been longing to purchase one of these rollers and I was soooo elated to receive my product. But when I finally used it on my face it broke!!! And I mean the stone flew! The metal pieces that hold the Jade stone almost cut my face. Mind I wasn't rolling hard. So I am very disappointed.,1,2,B07WWC3T9Q
"For the inexpensive cost I wasn’t sure whether or not the product would feel very high quality (though my aim was to just have something functional) but when I was taking the products out of the box to look at, they felt like expensive pieces.

"I've only had the product for a couple of days, so it's too early to see any results. But I gave the product 5 stars because it is as advertised. The color is very pretty; a light blush pink. It rolls smoothly, without noise and feels great on your skin! I can't wait to see if it improves the look of my skin. But even if it doesn't, I'll continue to use it because I like the relaxing benefit it provides from massaging my face :)",5,0,B07WWC3T9Q

My Gua Sha tool broke before I could even use it. Dropped in the sink as I took it out of the box and it broke right in half.

"At this point I love collecting these rollers. I love finding colors and shades that I don't already have. Of course I like using them as well, but it is for sinus and headache issues rather than hoping for results with my skin.

There is really no data to support the fact that it helps your skin. People say that it helps serums and such absorb better into your skin, but that's not really possible and it's no different then applying it with your fingers.

The roller is just making it dry on your skin faster due to rolling over it constantly and more air exposure etc.

So while I do love them just for the way that it feels good and I love it for sinus relief as well as headaches, I am just not sold on the idea that it will improve your skin in general, as there is no proof.

Most of these rollers are the same. Probably mostly all made in the same place by the same manufacturer with a different brand on them. Some are a little better than others in regards to how they are made, how they are attached to the handles, and little things like that. Some are a little squeaky when you use them, some roll a little lopsided and on some the metal may not feel as substantial or as good quality.

With this one specifically it does feel like a decent roller as far as construction quality, however the ome thing that I did notice that I did not like was that the larger end seems to be a completely different type of stone than the rest. The larger roller has a solid white appearance, where as the smaller roller and handle has the opaque crystal type stone look. So I don't really like that so much just because they look like they don't belong together because it is obviously 2 different types of stones. However, for my uses it obviously still works like it should, and still feels good on my skin, sinuses, pressure points etc.

There is no squeaky noises, no lopsided rolling, or anything like that, but if you are into derma rolling and you are into what the actual stones are supposed to do for you in regards to their properties, and not exactly improving your skin, just the properties of crystals and stones in general, then you may be disappointed if that roller end is not what it is supposed to be.
For me my complaint is the visual aspect of it just not looking as nice because that little roller and the handle are exactly the same and then that big roller is completely different.",,15,B07WWC3T9Q
"The Jade Roller & Gua Sha Set is supposed to stimulate the lymphatic system, increase blood circulation, Help maximize the absorption of the oil, serum or moisturizer, Reduce puffiness of the skin, relieve the appearance of under-eye circles, Brighten complexion, tighten pores and help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.
How to Use Jade roller:
1. Use the big roller on your chin, forehead, cheeks and neck.
2. Use the small part under the eyes and around the nose.
3. Roll the roller in an upward and outward motion.
4. Apply on the neck and then move up to your face.
5. Each section 3-5times and then move to the next section.
How to use the Gua
1. Make sure the tool is flat. Take the larger side and go up your neck 10 times each section. Switch the more curved section and go on your chin always moving upwards 10 times.
2. Use light to medium pressure.
3. Speed is slow and mindful. Guasha can also be used for your larger muscles, such as areas on your shoulder. Use the flat stone and it helps to relieve pain and stiffness.
Overall I like it.",,4,B07WWC3T9Q

"TLDR: stone roller dont help your skin. No scientific evidence of it helping at all. Your fingers do the same. They dont help products absorb. They dont help the contours of your face/face shape. It's a fad. Totally unproven. But, they're pretty and they feel good, so enjoy it :)

This one in particular is fine. Looks good, feels good. Nice darker green color. Rolls smooth. Feels like decent quality.

So, first of all you must know that the fad of facial rollers is just that - a fad that spread far and wide via beauty bloggers and Instagram and such.

There is no proof whatsoever that a roller does anything at all for your skin. It is not going to help the contours of your face or eliminate wrinkles or produce collagen, tighten pores or any of the other miraculous claims, no matter how many beauty influencers say it does.

It also doesnt help your skin products absorb better. It's a placebo effect. If you rub a small puddle of water with a roller, even on a hard non porous surface, it is going to DRY faster than just letting the little puddle alone. Because you're rubbing it and exposing more air to it. Same as if you would rub it with your fingers. Same as if you use a roller on your face with your skin products.. it is just making it dry faster, if it all. It is not making it absorb better. You will have the same results with your fingers.

If you already have a beauty routine and apply your products properly, you're already getting the same results.

In someone who doesnt already have a routine and starts one along with use of a roller, they might think, wow this really does work,.. but that's not really case. It's the products.

So, if you're already applying your products in a massaging way, you're not going to get better results with a roller. Your fingers do the same job. The roller is not going to make any changes to the condition of your skin.

Also, using one too much can actually make your skin worse by aggravating it. Especially if you have acne and especially if you're not cleaning the roller properly after each use and before each use. Your products and skin germs and bacteria are all built up on the roller, so if you're not cleaning and disinfecting properly every time, you're also doing more damage.. add that to excessive use and all you're doing is ruining your skin. Again, the roller isnt the magic.. your products are.

Lymphatic draining is a possibility and is often part of a good facial. Look up lymphatic drainage techniques (hint, it won't include a roller if you're reading from a reliable source). Lymphatic draining is actually done by gentle pinches all over the face and neck (hence, they now make the rollers with the balls on the ends instead of rollers. The balls create a gentle pinch. People are learning that rollers really arent the tool they're made out to be and that, that's not how lymphatic draining happens/works, so now they make the new roller with the balls which is a little more believable, but still not quite as effective as your hands).

Benefits that you see after using any roller is just temporary, same as if you used your fingers. Glowing skin, tight pores.. it's all the product and your fingers. To create more collagen, you have to actually damage it first. In order to that, you would have to use the roller in an almost violent way and cause very visible damage to your skin. No one does that. That is done with retinol, lasers, etc. Scientifically proven methods.

Any facial massage can help with circulation when it is done correctly and as far as eye puffiness, a cold spoon will have the same effect.. or any cold object for that matter, or cucumbers.. remember? People have used cold spoons for decades and decades.

So, even though I say all that and even though it sounds like I'm saying dont use one, I not. I still get them and I have quite a collection at this point. I mean, they're a dime a dozen and come in such pretty colors, how can you resist? Pretty much any store you go into, you can find a selection of them.

I like them because they feel good. It's a good way to relax. It feels good on my sinuses and also for headaches.

As long as you're not getting one with the belief that it will actually do something for your skin, go for it. Just dont buy into the hype. Its mythical.

Also, actual rose quartz will stay cold even after being on your skin. Jade warms up with your skin. Keep that in mind when you get your rollers because it is suspected that most rollers are not the stones/crystals that they claim to be. Real jade does not break easily, even if dropped. It is also very expensive. Rose quartz should be smooth as glass and very shiny. Both stones in general have different properties, if you believe in the properties of stones. Jade is for purity, health/healing, good fortune, good vibes and rose quartz is essentially for love and comfort.

No matter which one you use, it is sure to be a relaxing experience regardless of the stone or if it is real or not. So, go for it and make yourself feel good.. they definitely have that affect.. just don't expect a new and improved face.

Gua sha is a-whole-nother subject. If you research true gua sha, you'll see that to do it properly means it is done hard enough to cause bruising and pain. And typically someone else should do it for you, obviously and especially in hard to reach areas, as it is commonly used for releasing muscle tension and knots in the back, chest, etc. In the face it is more for lymphatic drainage again and its not the tool that matters, its the motions/scraping motions that do the work. Pretty stones do look better doing it though.",,2,B07WWC3T9Q
"I've incorporated the jade roller and tool to my nighttime face routine. After applying my moisturizer or oil to my face, I roll the jade over my skin, going in downward strokes from my jawline down my neck and rolling from the center of my face out towards my ears. It feels good because the jade stays cold which helps with soothing the skin and really getting the moisturizer into your skin. It's supposed to help with lymphatic drainage too. I love using it under my eyes for a little depuffing. Very calming and satisfying.",,26,B07WWC3T9Q
"BAIMEI Jade Roller and Gua Sha Set stimulates healthier skin and reduces signs of aging.

This jade roller stimulates healthier skin, the traditional Asian skincare massage using rose quartz stone rollers stimulates and rejuvenates blood circulation. It gives you a beautiful, healthier, and more natural glow. This product also reduces signs of aging. The anti aging roller and gua sha facial tool boosts collagen growth and cell repair. It helps minimize fine lines, wrinkles, puffy under eyes and under eye dark circles. This product is perfect for gifting and personal use!

I highly recommend this product!",,25,B07WWC3T9Q
"In Asia, especially in Japan, Korea and China, the use of rollers and Gua Sha is is popular.

Mainly to reduce puffiness and dark circles under the eyes, many believe the use of these helps stimulate the lymphatic system and also great for blood circulation.

The BAIMEI Jade Roller & Gua Shet would make an awesome gift as the big roller can be used under the neck/chin area, cheeks, forehead, while the smaller roller for under the eye area and nose.

Also helps in rolling a mask onto your face for moisturizing.

The Guasha is a treatment fox dryness and you apply when flat and the goal is that it moves serum into your skin. This one you go at a slower pace and can also be used on larger muscle areas. But many believe it helps prevents breakouts.

As for this one, this version is Jade for both the rollers and the Gua Sha. So it looks quite elegant!

Not to say its quite trendy now (it helps when Asian celebs, especially K-Pop celebs are using it) and it's been picked up by may beauty YouTubers as well. So, it's becoming more used around the world.

But it's subjective of whether or not it works but it's something that has been used for a long time in Asia and people believe in its daily benefits.

"This is a truly lovely jade roller. The green shade is beautiful and the gold-tone accents are very pretty. But what I love most about this roller is how cool and refreshing it feels. It truly is a surprise how 'cool' the jade feels on the skin.

Though I don't think that jade rollers work all the magic that is attributed to them, I do think they can stimulate circulation, help with puffy eyes and they just feel so good. I love using mine in the evening to help me relax. It is such a simple pleasure.

The roller is well made, does not squeak and should last a long time. Well worth the small price for a little luxury!",,0,B07WWC3T9Q
This roller set is made of OK but not impressive quality. The main thing to note is that the set is white. The roller ball works well but I didn't think the Gua Sha does anything for my face - it's just a piece of polished stone that you're supposed to rub against your skin. I don't see a reduction in wrinkles but I like to use the roller after applying makeup and it works great in spreading an even layer of foundation. It's OK for the price but I've found other rollers that were of higher quality than this one.,,0,B07WWC3T9Q
"I already own a rose quartz facial roller and an ice roller. This one was shaped exactly like my rose quartz roller. Unlike the rose one, this one stayed cool while I kept rolling my face. It was pleasant to use and it wasn't as cold as my ice roller making it ideal for using on my eyes around bedtime. Other then that it isn't different from the rose roller. I did notice however that because it is a porous stone it felt oily after I used it and I had to wash it.",4,0,B07WWC3T9Q

The roller is great. Its smooth and relaxing . The smaller side is useful to massage small areas. However the Gua sha shows thin layer of chipping on top layer. As we use only sides of Guasha it felt smooth may be just a cosmetic issue. But overall great for the price.,4,0,B07WWC3T9Q

The Product:
It looks awesome. I love the pink colors- it’s a super pretty product. It Feels solid and sturdy. A great addition to my beauty care products.
However, the small roller is a little lopsided. It’s roll movement is not as smooth as the larger side. Quite possible why someone returned it...?
The other piece looks dull sitting in the box, I didn’t want to touch it if it was used.

I wish I could report good news from my purchase. More importantly I wish I could have tried it. 😕

I wouldn’t let my above comments stop you from making your own purchase of the Jade Roller. It seems like a durable product. Things happen (and —> it’s year 2020🙃) I just received a bad one. I’ll make the return and then return here to this review to update ya on how it works 🥳

Good luck and Happy Shopping 🛍",3,2,B07WWC3T9Q
I've had this only a month and used it only a handful of times. I definitely feels nice but has already broken. It felt a little rickety from the start but finally gave way. I guess I can try to glue it and see what happens but disappointed it didn't last longer.,2,2,B07WWC3T9Q

"Very attractively made product. The stone roller is a pretty shade of pink quartz, and the trim is a pretty tone of rose gold. The gua sha stone is the same shade of pink quartz but seems awkward to use, so personally I have no intention of trying it. Both come in an attractive box that is perfect for gifting. I refrigerate the stone roller before use and use it primarily around my eye area. It is very soothing to use cold, and I suppose is de-stressing and provides a level of comfort. However, after several weeks of use, I do not see any improvement in my wrinkles nor puffiness around eye area. I will continue to use the roller simply because I love the way it feels rolling it cool against my skin. It has an excellent price point, and I do not think the more expensive, branded rollers will provide any additional benefit. I recommend this product if you want to try a quartz roller because it's good quality, and you won't have wasted a lot of money if you don't see a personal cosmetic benefit. I will continue to use my roller simply because it is soothing.",4,2,B07WWC3T9Q
"I use this after I wash my face, use toner and a light serum/lotion. This helps the serum further penetrate the skin and hit target areas. Even without refrigeration it's cooling at first touch. I imagine you could put this in the fridge and get even more cooling effects. It's a great addition to your self-care routine. Comes in a nice box package with inserts that may not be intended for everyday use. I just lightly spritz with alcohol and return to the box. You could also use soap. It's not necessary to press in hard. There are plenty of videos to guide you in using a Gua Sha set.",5,One,B07WWC3T9Q
"I've been using this roller for a few weeks now and I really like it. Not only does it feel good, it also unblocked some of my sinuses so I've had less facial pressure.

It was packaged nicely in its box (seems like most items from Amazon lately have come in a glorified ziploc bag so this was a pleasant surprise) and the roller itself is very pretty. The bonus gua sha has actually been quite useful in relieving pressure points in large muscles. I was very happy when I first received this.

Unfortunately, this morning I accidentally dropped my roller on my wood floor and the handle snapped. I realize quartz isn't indestructible but I thought it would be more durable than this. I'm going to try to tape or glue it back together. I'm hoping it'll still be useful, even if it isn't pretty anymore. Anyone who buys this, be very careful with it. It's more fragile than it looks.",3,0,B07WWC3T9Q
"I really love this simple little tool. It’s very easy to get used to how do use it effectively. I have A recurring issue with stiff neck and the wide side feels great rolled with pressure up-and-down on the sides. The jade is cool at first and is wonderful applied around the eyes and forehead. As it warms it is very relaxing on the throat, décolletage and jawline. This can be enhanced or prolonged using ice or microwave packs to rest it on. The flat tool is a very good deep tissue massager, I use it warm with lotion and it’s heaven in the arch of the foot. The box and packaging is nice if gift giving, with cleanly removable labels. This was a few dollars more than some on offer but I’m very glad I chose this one. I like it so much that when I saw a similar one at a local store in a more “masculine” green jade and half the price I grabbed it for my Husband. Well, it looks the same but it squeaks when rolling and seems rougher. That doesn’t bother him, so great score, and when using my smooth rolling silent pink one now, I feel like I’ve treated myself to a little luxury.",5,0,B07WWC3T9Q
"This is not a quality product. The roller is white quartz, not rose quartz. The rose gold hardware tricks the eye to make the quartz look pink, but when put next to actual rose quartz, it's obvious that it's plain white quartz.

The instructions are terrible too. Where it says ""Back"" with a picture of how you roll the wand down your back, the instructions say, ""Start at chin and swipe upward toward cheekbones."" And where it says ""Legs"", there are multiple spelling errors and typos, and it tells you to ""begin at the hairline and roll towards the ear.""

I would have given this 1 star, but opted for 2 because the Gua Sha is actually rose quartz and as expected. The wand is solid and made well. It's quiet and sturdy.",2,0,B07WWC3T9Q
"Haven't written a review on Amazon in quite a while but unfortunately the issue I have with this product can not be ignored.

Everything was in the box as stated, really like the smooth polish of the stones. Feels great against your skin.

My issue is that the small somewhat heart shaped stone arrived completely cracked in half and looked like it was glued back together and repolished. Not well either. There was still adhesive residue left on it which was easy to remove but still.

I couldn't say if this came directly from the manufacturer this way or if this was a return and the damage was overlooked and resold to me. Would have been nice if it was labeled as used as would not have bought it at the ""new"" price.

Overall the product itself is great. Looks and feels great but the issue with the cracked stone is really a letdown.

I haven't contacted the seller as of the date of this review as having to return another failed product from Amazon (also received a damaged pc monitor) is just too much at this point with everything else going on worldwide.",3,0,B07WWC3T9Q

The roller is beautiful. Very easy to hold & very smooth. Great quality. Despite it being packaged securely the roller was broken. I contacted the seller & provided a picture.

"The quality of the roller feels above others that I've tried. The stone is nice and heavy and feels cool and good on the skin.

Overall, great product so far!",5,0,B07WWC3T9Q
"Missing Piece - No Scraper Tool in Box and... roller pinches my skin, hurts like its not a good product. Looks nice but gold trim catches my skin on rolling and hurts. PLUS NO SCRAPER MASSAGE TOOL WAS IN BOX. VERY DISAPPOINTING.",2,One,B07WWC3T9Q
I bought this so I wouldnt contaminate my moisturizer but sticking my fingers in it and contaminating my face with my hands. This works great. It rolls easily and really massages in the moisturizer.

"I have a couple other facial rollers but they are not jade and one of them is a rough texture and the rollers are not polished smooth like this one, so I was very excited to get this set. First, it comes in a really nice gift box. When you pick up the roller, since the handle is also polished it is very smooth and comfortable to hold. I love that the rollers are cool temperature, and my favorite way to use this roller is to run is under cold water and roll it over my face for a few seconds, then run under cold water again, and repeat. I don’t bother to dry my face. The cold water combined with the feel of the cold roller is incredible, especially in the morning or after you’ve come in from the outside when it’s very warm out. It’s a very calming feeling, and is also a stress-reliever. As far as the gua sha, I confess I do not use it as intended as in a scraping method. I like to cool this also and place it under my eyes for about 30 seconds to help reduce puffiness. Both of these pieces are made very well, feel good in the hands, and this one is by far my favorite. Get yourself this set and your face will thank you.",,One,B07WWC3T9Q

I refrigerate the box and use the large roller on my cheeks, jaw, forehead, and neck. The smaller one I use on my under eye area, lids, and brow bone area. I apply a light gel moisturizer liberally first, then roll it in with the ice cold jade. It feels like heaven on my rosacea filled, hot and burning cheeks, with no irritation. I roll the moisturizer in well and it feels great.

I do recommend you try one of these, jade, quartz, whatever stone you like. It is more than I ever expected. The big, curved, Palm size piece is called a gua sha (sp) I just use it in a similar fashion after moisturizing at night. Glide the curved edge over the cheeks, jaw and neck. Use the knobby end on my forehead sometimes, or along my jaw. The narrow curve I use under and ll around my eyes till the moisturizer is worked into skin. Feels great!! The roller is the main attraction, but I am enjoying the flat stone as well.",5,0,B07WWC3T9Q
"I love these natural stone roller and scraping tool combos as part of one’s skin care and face routine. The cold of the stone helps reduce inflammation and soothe tired skin, while the gentle pressure and movement of both roller and scraper can help increase blood flow, decrease friction or discomfort between the skin, facia, and muscle. What’s best about it is that these are reusable tools, so it’s an eco-friendly choice that doesn’t require anything disposable or even any products. I suggest researching how best to use this, both in terms of lymphatic drainage, as well as what scraping tools can do and how they are used for physical therapy, massage, and relaxation.
Note: the color wasn’t exactly what I expected, and it didn’t really match the photo, but I don’t particularly mind. Also bear in mind that natural stone has a lot of variety, so if yours arrives a bit different, that’s to be expected. The darker green ones are dyed, which is not necessarily a bad thing, so much as an FYI.",,0,B07WWC3T9Q
"This set is beautiful and the stone has a great energy. Well worth the price.

"I love that it feels so cold against my skin without you having to do a think to it. It really helps with my eye puffiness. First I cover my clavicle with an up-and-down motion. Next, I do a sweeping up-and-down roll on my neck. After this comes the jawline; here I switch to a back-and-forth roll that starts at the center of the chin and goes toward my ear, repeating this all the way up to my cheekbone. On my forehead I repeat the vertical roll, starting from the middle of my face and moving outward toward my temples. When you perform this technique consistently (i.e., via your face roller of choice), it's supposed to deliver depuffing, glow-boosting benefits. Also, it just feels really nice. I found that gua sha (unlike rolling) perceptibly lessened the tension in my neck and jaw.",,0,B07WWC3T9Q
"Both tools are very easy to hold in my hand, and it’s very convenient to give myself a massage on my face, shoulders, arms and legs. The Gau Sha is my favorite, as I can apply different pressure, as needed, and feel my blood circulation increase. When I use it before bedtime, I use it in a lighter motion to help me relax, whereas during the day, I apply more pressure, and I feel more invigorated.

The jade roller feels nice against my face and is very soothing. I haven’t noticed any real difference to my skin as a result of using the roller, but it feels relaxing. In my opinion, the handy, portable little massage tools are great to have and make a great gift. Just be careful not to use them on non-carpeted services because if you drop the stone, it will break.",,0,B07WWC3T9Q
"This would make a great gift. The box itself deserves five stars...it’s a shimmery White with gold writing on it. Very classy. It flips open to reveal the jade roller and flat gua sha pieces encased in styrofoam. They are both well made, easy to wash (I just usually rinse with some soap and water), and work as expected. I like the roller a lot - it feels really nice on your skin. It’s usually cold when you use it (which is probably good for minimizing undereye puffiness or similar things), but I like to run it under warm water first, then dry it off and roll. That is just so soothing to have the warm roller going over your face. So relaxing. Overall, great set and would recommend for yourself or for a gift!",,0,B07WWC3T9Q
"I have puffy eye bags, especially in the morning so I decided to give the jade roller a try.

I’ve had it for a week now and have used it faithfully every morning with moisturizer, but I don’t see a difference yet. Despite not seeing a difference with inflammation under my eyes, I am enjoying the facial massage this roller provides. Plus, it includes a gua sha stone which also feels really nice and soothing to the face. I'm hoping that using the roller and stone faithfully each day that I'd soon be able to reap some benefits.

My only gripe is that there is a terrible squeak when I use the larger roller, so I may have a defective one. The smaller end slides smoothly without a squeak.",,0,B07WWC3T9Q

"Lovely jade roller. The scraping tool is wonderful as well, I generally use it to hold under my eyes so that the coolness helps reduce puffiness.

"I have a lot of hair. A LOT. Like, wow, who is that Wookiee over there LOTS. I have looked into having a third arm surgically implanted (Is this a thing? Who would do it? Vascular surgery? Orthopedic surgery?These are the questions that keep me up at night🤔) because my shoulders are so tired holding up a dryer and a round brush for eternity. I briefly considered making a workout video (“Toned Arms: the Hairdryer Workout”), but was informed by fitness people that there isn’t a market for a 75-minute focus on the anterior deltoids. I almost have to wake up BEFORE I GO TO SLEEP in order to have enough time to dry my hair before work.

This thing took me 8 minutes. I naturally assumed, upon finishing, that I had entered some sort of Amazon-created beauty time warp. I checked with my husband, in the next room, and in fact I did not go through a blowout wormhole. The silkier-than-silk style was accomplished by this miracle of a brush in 8 minutes (several more minutes were lost to running my hands through my hair and flicking it over my shoulder while smiling coquettishly in the mirror).

If you struggle with an over abundance of hair like I do, seriously consider giving this amazing contraption a try.",5,"8,164",B01LSUQSB0
"I loved this blow dryer for its simplicity and ease of use. I’d use it every week on wash day and for incredible results. But then I started noticing my hair was thinning and eventually a large section of it looked as though it was fried. I realize that the metal used in between the brissals was getting so hot that it was burning my hair and overtime eventually led to major hair loss. I had to chop my hair in order to stimulate regrowth and have been on the road to healthy hair recovery since. If you care and love your tresses, please go the old fashioned route with a roller brush and conventional dryer to control distance and heat exposure. It’s more work but if something feels too good to be true it most likely is!",1,"4,969",B01LSUQSB0
It didn't even last me a minute. I turned it on and after a few seconds the sound changed and the handle got hot and it started smelling burnt. I turned it off and let it cool down. After 10 mins i tested it again and this time it had smoke coming from the bottom near the cord. I let it cool down again and then after turn it around trying to figure out what went wrong i heard some sounds coming from the bottom. There were shards of some broken plastic coming out of the dryer. It's horrible. SUCH A WASTE OF MONEY! Can't believe i spent $90 on this. It didn't even touch my hair!!! I had such high hopes for this item... I thought it would last me forever and it would be save me so much time and money in hair care. Worst online purchase in my life. This was the second time i bought this item.. Thinking the first time it broke the same way that it was an error on my part. But this time I made sure I just held it in my hand away from anything at all and tested it first. I spend almost $200 for 2 hairdryers that never even touched my hair!!!!!! Can't believe Amazon sells this! I am so mad and upset. What assurance do I even have if i send these items back for a refund!

"I would give a zero for both this product and Amazon Prime. I was very disappointed in this product and had I read the mouse type where this was only covered for one month, if purchased through Amazon Prime I would have bought this from a local store such as Target or Meijer as they both honor returns up to 90 days or longer.

I used this product five times and then it stopped working. It would not reset and the barrel became so hot I was fearful it would catch on fire. To return this, now to the manufacturer will cost me an addition $15.00 and honestly this blow dryer isn't worth $65.00 or the aggravation to deal with it.

For the price I paid this product should have held up for at least a year.

Lesson learned -- read the fine print with Amazon before you purchase. you're probably better off buying from a local vendor! Very disappointed in the lack of customer service Amazon Prime offers.

"This really threw me for a loop. I NEVER write reviews and I feel as if I needed to write one for this product. I bought this in late May of 2019 and it is now mid November 2019. I’ve had this product for a total of 5 and a 1/2 months. During this time frame, I would say that this product was AMAZING! I have severely curly hair and this styled my hair in about 6 minutes whereas before it would take me 45 mins to dry and style my hair. HOWEVER, this morning I was surprised and shocked. It started working fine, but then mid-styling, it started sparking and then COMPLETELY set ablaze! It was on fire... I had to throw this out IMMEDIATELY. What if it exploded right next to my head? What if my hair caught on fire? What if something worse had happened? I’m completely shocked and disappointed. This WAS a good product until now. I saw the reviews before I bought this, warning about the fire - but thought that there might have been faulty ones.

"After reading rave reviews of this thing on Buzzfeed and other sites, I debated getting it no less than three times. And by debate, I mean spent over an hour each time reading reviews and looking at review pictures and holding my finger over the ""add to cart"" button.

I'm sorry I did. First off, let me just say that my hair is a jerk. It's an extremely healthy jerk. It's very fine and pin-straight, thick and shiny. No product in this world or the next works on getting it to curl. I've tried every idea out there. I've had professionals try to make it curl. I've tried varying styling products in varying orders for varying amounts of time. Wet or dry. Overnight or high heat. Curled twisted kinked rolled wanded sprayed gelled moussed YOU NAME IT. My hair stays straight.

So why did I order this? Well, after a multitude of reviews, I thought that perhaps if my hair dried with a slight curl to the ends, the combo of heat and drying would give it that blowout look that so many others are bragging about. That would be an improvement on the stick-straight look I rock day to day and I would finally have one small styling victory. I got this on a black friday sale, because adventure should not break the bank. I watched the youtube tutorials on using it. Many of them. I read the success reviews with the smiling pictures. I was prepared when the box finally arrived.

But no, I wasn't prepared at all. This product was terrible for my hair. First of all, my hair did not gain any sort of volume on the ends at all. None. My hair flipped away from the roller and dried flat. I held it down into a nice curl shape. Steam wafted off the dryer. The hair still dried flat. Volume on the crown, perhaps? No, blow drying my hair upside down works better than this, my hair has almost zero volume on top when I use this. All my fine baby-hairs get blasted every which way, resulting in that fluffy chicken look.

Is there a redeeming quality? Believe me, no one wants to think that they let money fly out the window, I wanted desperately to use this for *something*. Even as a normal blow dryer. But no sir, that won't even work, because this product does something to my hair that makes it dry and tangled at the ends. I don't know what, it's like the boar bristles suck the moisture out of my hair and suddenly my hair that I have never even needed to brush before is a sticky tangled mess on the bottom.

Pretty bummed. I had high hopes. I've tried again and again, thinking that perhaps I just needed practice. No, I don't need practice, I need a miracle. For the time being, my hair will remain straighter than ever. For those of you who are foolish enough to wonder how to get your hair this healthy, let me bestow my curse upon you: I only wash it once every two days and make sure to condition the roots and ends liberally with ""strengthening"" conditioner. And now there is no hope.

For all others who call this product a miracle: I am truly glad for you. May your hairdays always be great.",1,383,B01LSUQSB0
"I bought the revlon dryer brush and the tres semme dryer brush. The photos show the size difference, it's not clear but the revlon brush and similar no name brand models are oblong, with long flat sides (about 3"") and curves on the edges. I was totally surprised by how big it was and that it wasn't round. It is too big for my bangs but ok for the sides. It straightens very well and dries in a few minutes and I have thick hair that is usually wavy and frizzes and flips up. My hair hasn't flipped at all, and little frizz even on a rainy day. I ended up buying the tresemme brush in order to try to get some lift with my bangs and shorter parts of my hair. The tresemme only has short plastic bristles that aren't holding my thick hair on the brush as well, but it is giving some lift and a bit more curl on the ends. The drying power is not as strong so it takes longer to dry with the tresemme. The dryer brush is a lot easier to use than a flat iron, and doesn't leave any edge marks like the flat iron, it looks shiny and more natural. Wish I had tried this 20 years ago. Both have low, high, and cool settings. The revlon is a handful to hold but it dries fast. Neither brush spins on it's own, and I'm glad about that as I don't want my hair getting tangled. The revlon brush has a mixture of longer plastic bristles and shorter natural bristles-- which does pull a little hair out as you self spin (nothing that I can feel) the brush which you can see in the photo. Anyway, I'm using a combo, using the revlon to straighten the longer hair and the tresemme for the shorter hair to get some lift and large curl. If you have a stacked cut or shorter cut the tresemme is probably the best size brush if you only want one. You might want to dry it a little bit then use it to style. The cords spin on both so they don't get twisted up. They both get pretty hot on high so try no to touch the center and keep rotating the brush so you don't burn your hair, try the lower setting if it's a problem. The revlon brush is definitely better for longer hair.",4,321,B01LSUQSB0

Unbelievable easy and I didn’t even have to go back over it with a flat iron! Dry in record time and looks naturally straight! (None of those odd bumps) I can’t wait to dry my girls hair after a nighttime bath too. I almost never write reviews but thanks to this magical thing I had the time! 💁🏼,5,560,B01LSUQSB0
"I was debating for years getting one of these tools and was about to shell out the $400+ for a dyson when this gizmo crossed my online shopping path. I watched some very convincing youtube videos praising it (most notably Malibu's ""THE BEST DRUGSTORE HAIR DRYER"" video) and trusted them enough to try. At least I would get the sense that I'd actually USE such a tool prior to shelling out the $$ for the dyson air wrap (very similar type of styler).

PROS: It is exactly as advertised and ideal for the medium-length, lazy hair styler like me. I always loved the salon round brush + hairdryer blow out look, but could never get the hang of doing it to myself. This items fixes the convoluted acrobatics one would usually have to pull. I love that the tip is cool enough to hold so that I use both hands to roll and pull the brush down and it is light enough that, even after doing my whole head in three layers, 4 sections each, my arms aren't tired! Hazaah!

CONS: That being said, I can see the two major complaints that lead me to giving 4 instead of 5 stars. 1. there is a huge risk of damaging your hair if you're not careful because it gets seriously hot (see suggestions below) and 2. it's obviously not of the highest quality parts and I won't be surprised if it breaks apart soon. Number 2, I cannot do anything about, just be as careful as I can. Number 1, I have some tips & tricks gleaned from the wise old internet, trials and common sense.

SUGGESTIONS:
- do NOT use the heat options at all if you have super, super fine, delicate hair. Sorry :(. The ""cool"" option may work for you for styling nearly already dry hair, but it's a bit of an expensive gamble.
- Always use a heat protector balm or spray. I'm loving the Bumble and Bumble Thickening Great Body Blow Dry Creme. This will keep split ends from excessively drying out and becoming more splitty (not a word, I know)
- Even with my thick hair, I decided right away NEVER USE THE HIGH HEAT SETTING. It's just too ridiculously hot and I could tell it was damaging + I couldn't bring it anywhere near my scalp.
- It is so much safer to wait for your hair to air dry 80% and then use this tool on the low heat setting to finish off styling. I could tell the ""high"" was created for fast drying with soaking wet hair, but it is not worth the lasting damage or scalding your scalp, my friends.

I still hope to find the ideal tool soon, with a wider array of heat adjustment options and made to last decades. Until then, I am super grateful to Revlon for showing me that I CAN have a salon-style blow dry at home. I have about 4 weddings coming up this year and except for the one where I'll need a bridesmaid's updo, I now trust myself with this tool to style my own hair well enough to be special-event worthy :).",4,215,B01LSUQSB0
"Y’all, I can’t make this up. I despise blow drying and styling my hair because it’s so long and freakishly thick. It takes me over an hour with a normal hairdryer to dry and style when I do put forth the effort to do so... which isn’t (wasn’t) often. Ponytails were my go-to 99% of the time.

20 minutes.

That’s how long it takes me to do my hair from wet out of the shower, to straight and sleek locks using this thing.

Best purchase I’ve made this year!",5,151,B01LSUQSB0
"Used it the 1st time and absolutely loved it! I was ready to share with all my friends how awesome it was. I was actually excited to use it again. The second time, I started to dry my hair and within the FIRST FIVE MINUTES of drying, it smelled bad and shut off. The top of the handle got hot and even after sitting for an hour, it still hasn't turned back on. What good is a hairdryer that gets overheated drying hair in 5 minutes?!?",1,412,B01LSUQSB0
"I really liked this dryer the first 2 months I used it. It worked great on my hair! Unfortunately, it started smelling like it was burning after only 2 months of use. I let it cool down and tried it again. When switched on again, more burnt motor smell with an anemic motor which started smoking and died!",1,227,B01LSUQSB0
"Not big into leaving reviews but this blow dryer deserves my post and hopefuy I can help a busy mom out there find the one styling tool she can live with. I was so nervous about using this dryer on my frizzy curls but I was soooo pleasantly surprised. The blow dry time for my curls went from 35-40 mins to about 20. I had to get used to turning the dryer on while holding the section of hair I was about to dry next, but once I got that figured out, it was smooth sailing, literally. I have enough flip at the ends and just enough volume without it being too much. The texture is smooth and frizz free and it's not over dry as it can be with some heat tools. I would normally blow dry and then flat iron my hair because the blow dryer alone would not smooth out my frizz enough and the south Florida humidity would make my hair puff up nasty the minute I stepped out of my house. I'm on Day 2 of using this blow dryer and I didn't follow it up with the flatiron and I love the bounce and smoothness. I might have just found the best drying product in the world for my Hispanic frizzy curls. And I've stored my flatiron away for now, until I want stick straight hair again. My coworker has this dryer too and her hair is longer than mine, well she has beautiful big waves and smooth, no frizz hair. Oh and we've used this on a 4 year old with thin wavy hair and on a 6 year old with thick, course frizzy curls and both had great drying time and results. I would recommend 100%.",5,375,B01LSUQSB0
"Oh.My.Goodness. I just received this brush/blow dryer yesterday and it has already changed my hair game drastically! I’m seriously so uncoordinated with a brush in one hand and dryer in the other that I’ve given up long ago and leave my hair sobbing wet to let it dry to a kinky frizz (joys of thick hair). But 20 mins this morning and it’s dry, straight, and polished (used a little drying spritz). The barrel is large so it’s great because it gently grabs a lot of hair. The only negative to this is it’s a little loud (probably because I’m not used to any dryer) but it’s completely tolerable.",5,108,B01LSUQSB0
"First of all I have 3A/3B curls (i included a pic.) I watched a LOT of reviews on YouTube for this product before i committed to buying it because that's always smart to do when you dont want to waste money. But omg my results came out better than all the reviews i saw with the girls that had similar hair to mine! The trick is to keep rolling it a few times before you let the strand go... Just like the stylist do when they blow dry your hair at salons with the large rolling brush. I was able to straighten my hair in 45mins on my first time & i could probably do it in less time next time because now i know how to use it. I was worried about my roots not getting straightened like in some of the reviews i saw but nope my roots came out perfect! The trick to that is to hold it at the roots for a few seconds.

After a strand is straight & completely dry ill switch it to cool & pass it thru another time. If you want your ends straight & not flipped you'll need a flat iron but i prefer them flipped anyways. Only minor cons i found is that its easy to burn your hands by accidentally touching the blower. Also your wrist/hands will get tired & be a little sore. Still worth it tho lol. Oh ive also somehow manage to turn the switch accidentally a few times while using it. My hair is amazingly soft and super shiny. The biggest pro for me is that itll only take me 10mins to refreshen my hair every day after that first day! Best styling product ever!",5,147,B01LSUQSB0
"okay so at first, i didnt really like it. I did the bottom layer of my hair and it looked the same as when i use a normal blowdryer. fast forward to me doing all my hair and it looked amazing. I have super frizzy, fluffy, damaged, curly hair and this made it look like i spent hours blow drying and straightening it. works great! Dont do it right after you get out of the shower or it actually will take hours. Let your hair dry some before doing it. The second section of my hair went way faster because i had spent so much time using this on my soaking wet 1st section of hair. Its big, but not super heavy. The brush works great, BUT its very hard to get the roots of your hair bc this is a big machine. I had to basically scrape my face with this brush then roll up to get my roots. Would be nice if they made a mini one for babyhairs and roots.",5,107,B01LSUQSB0
"UPDATE 4/25/2018: I LOVED this hair dryer at first. For the first time in my life, I was able to give myself a decent blowout! However, after only a month or two of use, the cool and low heat settings stopped working and the bristles have gotten severely warped. Currently, the high heat setting still works, but it's starting to emit a burning smell so it's only a matter of time before it completely dies. I really wanted to like this dryer, because it's a great idea, but poorly executed to withstand long-term use.

First of all, I hate blow dryers and I've never been good at blowing out my hair. While I have a lot of experience with straightening my hair with a flat iron, I've never been able to master the art of wielding a round brush with a hairdryer at the same time. I have to admit I was skeptical about this blow dryer, but I was pleasantly surprised! I have very thick hair that is dry, coarse, and curly--I was shocked that my hair was actually smooth, shiny, and soft after using this blow dryer! AND it cut my flat ironing time in half! The only negative thing I can say about this hairdryer is that the cord is a little shorter than I would like, but otherwise, I am very happy with my purchase!",1,274,B01LSUQSB0
"I'm quite unskilled at hair styling. In fact I've done everything to avoid using hair dryers or any form of heat on my hair for many years in the belief that my hair will be healthier air dried. Over the last couple of years, I've started to experiment with heated styling tools for those times when air drying is not practical. My hairstyle is current a short layered bob. This brush is easy to use. I would use a hair dryer first to remove excess wetness, and then use this brush to style. This brush will provide volume. To keep up the volume I'd use a thermal protectant that has some hold. There are a couple of not so positives. One, the brush is quite big and can be a bit unwieldy. Two, the volume you'll get won't be as full or long lasting versus using a round brush and hair dryer. So if you're good at doing your own blow outs, I see no reason to buy this. But if you're like me, and you want something easy to use, then this does a good enough job.",4,329,B01LSUQSB0
I waited until I had used this for a month to review... still as in love with it as day one. My hair is naturally wavy and I let it air dry halfway before using the dryer/straightener. It does a perfect job and leaves my hair super soft/silky. I one hundred percent say ‘BUY!’ I’d you are at all the fence. This thing is fantastic and has cut my time getting ready in half!,5,86,B01LSUQSB0
"Initially thrilled with it. After a couple months it shorted out on me. Sparks, pops, smoke while I was using it!!!
Dangerous product-don't buy!",1,264,B01LSUQSB0
"So I hated this hairdryer at first because you basically have to learn how to use it before it’s any good. Your hair cannot be super wet or it will take a lifetime to dry and my hair is not thick. Towel dry your hair till just mostly damp then you can use this and it works great. That’s my biggest complaint, since with a typical hairdryer and brush it doesn’t matter how wet your hair is before starting since you’re not putting the thing against your hair. But this is a little easier to use then two things at once. Pros and cons. It’s loud too. I don’t like that, and buzzes strange sometimes. Requires frequent hair detangle clean out.",4,84,B01LSUQSB0
"I was so thrilled when i opened this drying brush. Big oval shaped barrel with little imitation ""boar"" bristles along with the long plastic and tipped bristles, which hold the hair so you can pull it as you're drying it. ""Perfecr!"" I thought.

Until I reali=zed how inredibly hot tghe remperature was. The Low and High settings refer to the vokume of air that blows out, not the temperature. It's so hot that your hair all but burns your fingers when you touch it. I don't think there's enough temperature-protecting lotions or potions you could apply that will protect hair from being damaged by this extremely high heat. So it is with great reluctance and sadness that I have to return it. As much as I love the design, I'm not willing to severely damage my hair.

I was just on the phone with a girlfriend who had purchased it also and had the exact same problem. She returned it and has been looking for a comparably designed product that comes with a temperature control feature, with no luck. I'm shocked that a company like Revlon would sell a product that has such high potential to damage hair. Unless, of course, it hopes to or expects to sell more products for ""damged hair.""",1,93,B01LSUQSB0
"I'm one to read ""all of the negatives"" before deciding to purchase something, weighing out my options, but it seems that a great majority of these negative reviews are completely uninformed and this Revlon hair dryer is not deserving of these reviews. I'm therefore posting this review, hoping it will be helpful as people are trying to decide on this.
I've read many reviews on how ""this broke after a few uses!"", or shortly after receiving, and lambasting Amazon, or Revlon, complaining about ""how much it costs!"" to purchase another one, or how they ""just missed out on the warranty!"" because it was over 30 days.
This hair dryer broke on me just after a year of having it, which is NOT a great thing. I didn't bother with Amazon, but called Revlon directly. They simply asked me for some numbers on the cord/plug, and they sent me a replacement that arrived within a few days! Easiest thing ever! I'm not sure what the problem is with people saying how ""they don't stand by their product"" or ""it's a waste of money!"".
You'll get a BRAND NEW one if yours breaks.
The Revlon salon One-Step Hair Dryer & Volumizer has a 4-year limited warranty. For further assistance please contact Consumer Services 1-800-487-7273.
Just because a person is not an informed consumer that doesn't mean they should be bringing down a product. Sure, it's not good that it breaks, but they will do what they can to make up for it.",1,64,B01LSUQSB0
"First, I do love this product. I think it provides an almost salon quality blow out. It is great for brushing product out of your hair at the end of the day. Or styling damp hair after swimming.
It is however, not really made to dry your hair from soaking wet. I would say , the last 20% only. Due to the high heat, it can easily burn your hair. Obviously, if it is too hot to touch, it shouldn’t be touching your hair. So, you can tell.
They updated it and I was hoping for some improvements. Maybe a cooler temp and a true cooling setting. The current cooling setting is not very cool. Unfortunately, it seems to be the same as the prior model, with only the color changing.
The biggest problem with this appliance is that you cannot remove the brush to clean it.
This is my second one this year. The boar bristles do get worn out and clogged with hair oils and product. Cleaning it with a damp cloth as they recommend could take hours. Even after a few uses. I had to use a cloth with alcohol on it and it took about 45 minutes to clean.
If I didn’t like it so much, it would have gone in the trash.
It has its uses. But has perhaps more negatives than positives.",4,89,B01LSUQSB0
"I am honestly impressed, and that takes a lot!

I have super curly, thick, often frizzy hair (thanks Dad!) that is about halfway down my back. This cut my dry/style time down well below half of what it takes with a regular blow dryer and round brush. And best of all my hair looks like I spent a ton of time/money on it. Sleek, shiny, and not at all frizzy.

I am by no means a hair professional, but I have fairly wide range of high end styling tools at home. This is by far my new favorite. It is much easier to handle/manage than styling with a round brush and dryer.

PROS: easy to use, quick, manages unruly hair with ease, beginner friendly, great for thick/curly hair.

CONS: it’s much heavier and louder than the pro-level dryer I’m used to. However, it’s by no means a deal breaker since it cuts dry/style time significantly. It takes some getting used to (after the first time I got the hang of it) because you aren’t juggling a brush and the dryer.

ALSO! I’ve seen many people get the paddle brush version of this and aren’t as satisfied. DEFINITELY make sure you’re getting the dryer/volumizer/round brush style version of this!

Overall, this has revolutionized my hair-game. Instead of only doing an at home blowout when I have time (like 45-60minutes) I can now use this every time I wash my hair. Amazing.

HIGHLY recommended to anyone who loves the look of a blowout but doesn’t want to devote the time to one!",5,198,B01LSUQSB0
"i don't like this at all. i don't like the oval brush, it makes my hair very flat. the john frieda 1.5 inch round dryer works much better. this is way too big and bulky.",1,158,B01LSUQSB0
I am old. I was skeptical because with round hairbrush as I always get my hair stuck but not with this.,5,77,B01LSUQSB0
"I've seen several reviews floating around on this styling tool and I finally caved in and bought it. I am so happy I did!

For reference, I have naturally fine curly hair. I try not to use hot styling tools to avoid breakage (also, my hair is dyed). But once in a while I like to straighten it out.

I am not a stylist, so I'm sure my technique (or attempt) at blow drying my hair is already kind of questionable.
All that to say that my right side comes out nicer and smoother cause I have better control using my dominant hand.

First impression after opening:

Nicely constructed, sturdy and surprisingly light weight for its size.

The handle is perfect, imo...no hand fatigue holding up the dryer.

It was nice using my dominant hand the entire time. I had a smooth and even blowout.

It dried my hair in about 10 minutes or less. That's record time!

It provided volume w/ no frizz.

Definitely worth it!

SN: I gave it 3 stars ""for traveling"" because I haven't traveled with it lol and frankly I'd be upset if anything happened to it while vacationing.",5,70,B01LSUQSB0
"I was really hopeful about this after hearing rave reviews from a friend but I'll be returning it. For reference, my hair is medium length, curly/wavy, frizzy and thin. Sadly, I have nothing good to say about this brush but here are the cons for me:
Bulky;
The brush part is big, which may work for long hair but it didn't work on the shorter (cheek length) pieces of my hair;
It blows hot air on all sides so it burned the skin on my neck and ears;
The only temperature adjustments are cool and hot (the low setting is still hot, just doesn't blow as hard);
It made my hair even more frizzy than using a blow dryer and round brush;
I had to put my hand over the brush part to keep my hair from blowing out of it, which also burned my hand; and
This is minor but it's loud (not louder than a normal hair dryer but it's that high-pitched sound you'd expect from a cheap hotel hair dryer).

While I can understand how this may be a great tool for different hair types and lengths, it just didn't work for mine.",1,87,B01LSUQSB0
Broke today after 3 months of use!,1,142,B01LSUQSB0
"Junk, Delivered Dec 12, 2018 stopped working on Dec 28, 2018. My wife liked it for the 2 1/2 weeks it worked!

10% ONE STAR reviews says it all ;-(",1,91,B01LSUQSB0
"My hair is super thick, so I rarely blow dry it because it takes so dang long. Well, not with this bad boy! I can pretty much get my hair straight and dry in around 20 minutes. This thing is heavy, so it is a bit of a work out but no where near as tedious as having to use both hands to hold a brush and blow dryer. I love this thing so much I bought it for my mom who straightens her hair every single day and she also thinks it's a game changer. My only complaint would be that this doesn't come in a smaller barrel size, as this size is really only great with long hair.",5,63,B01LSUQSB0
"Blow-out at home! This gave me salon-quality results on my own. I have thick, naturally curly hair. Blowing dry my hair in the past also required use of a straightener and hot rollers to put some bounce back in (a total of about 1.5 hours). This tool did it all in one step in about 25 minutes! Highly recommended.",5,61,B01LSUQSB0
"When I first received this product I LOVED it. I usually spend 30 min or more straightening my curly hair with a blow dryer and round brush. This cut that time in half easily. However, after only about 10 uses, I was using this brush when I heard a snap and a high pitched squeel and then a burning smell. Luckily I jumped and got it away from my hair as soon as possible. I tried turning it on several times since then and it continues to make a clattering/squeeling sound and smell of smoke, so I can no longer use it.",1,81,B01LSUQSB0
"I am not someone who normally writes reviews but I like this dryer so much I must give it a positive review.

This dryer has been a game changer for my hair. I have a lot of hair and the strands are thick. I’ve been a flat iron user for many, many years but decided to try this on the recommendation of a friend. Not only is it easy to use, it gives my hair the closest thing to a professional blowout at home. There are tutorials online for maximizing the benefits of this dryer. Note: My hair can take the heat and the dryer gets really hot. If you have fine hair or hair that is easily damaged by heat I would research more before buying.",5,54,B01LSUQSB0
"I loved the way it works on my hair. Makes it smooth and shiny and dries quickly.
I received this 8 days ago. The problem is after about a week of use the bristles are falling out. Not just a few but lots of them. At this rate there will not be any left in a month. The picture is what I found in the sink after using it today. When I checked the floor I had also lost one of the large bristles with the ball tip. (Pictures attached)
I will need to send this back unfortunately. Nov. 8th UPDATE: Amazon took care of a replacement. This one works great! So far no bristles have fallen out and it works great!
UPDATE: I used this dryer for a year and it started making a sizzling noise the other day and then smoke started coming out. I let it cool down plugged it in and it would not start. I appears to be dead. I think it should have lasted longer then a year!",3,75,B01LSUQSB0
"I'm in love with this product. I have fine hair, which when I blow-dried, looked like a frizzy mess. I would have to go back and straighten it the next day, which left my hair lifeless. This product doesn't necessarily give me the voluminous salon blowout but it's still a dozen steps up from the regular blow-dry. I might have to use some volumizing products and see if that helps.

I would recommend letting your hair air dry until it's 70% dry and then go in with this product. If you have fine hair, use the low setting!

There are a couple of downsides that I've noticed when using this product. The first is the settings button. It's in an awkward position where you have to use two hands to twist it to the setting you want. I wish it was just an up/down button like most hair dryers have. Every time I section a piece of hair to dry it, I have to then let it go and twist the handle so that I can turn it on. And it's a little annoying to move it as it can easily go from off to hot. I wish this was in a better area where you could do it easily with one hand and the push of a button.

That said, I also wish it would have a temperature setting. Or at least show what the temperature is of low vs hot. Maybe it would be better if it had a medium setting as well in case those two settings aren't good for your hair type. Just a couple thoughts but those would make the product better.

I do like it, though. It saves time and is much less damaging on your hair.",5,45,B01LSUQSB0
"I had to try it... It works really well. Dried my hair super-fast, but also left it kind of wispy and thinner looking than usual. With that being said, my hair ""is"" thin. So, maybe it had nothing to do with the dryer. It is a tiny bit heavy and felt HUGE in my hand ( and I have big hands for a chic ) so a smaller girl might struggle with it. All in all, I dig it enough to keep it. Cool addition to my hair game!",4,55,B01LSUQSB0
"Overall this did an ok job. I have curly fine hair and I still had to use my straightener when I was done using this. I liked that I was able to use the brush with the blow drying power all in one, because I’m not good at holding a round brush and blow drying with 2 tools. It definitely made my hair straighter and less frizzy than if I had dried it with the blow dryer like normal! I gave it 4 stars because I just did not achieve a perfect blow out style on my hair type. Be careful not to touch the brush part while using it because it’s extremely hot! I accidentally touched it a couple times and got burned. The rest of the brush (top and handle) did not get hot at all while I was using it. It’s pretty loud, like a hair dryer, I wasn’t sure what to expect before turning it on. Overall I like it and I’ll keep it because it was easy to use and made my hair less frizzy than my normal hair dryer.",4,39,B01LSUQSB0
"I’ve got thin, fine, slightly wavy hair cut in a collar-length bob. I partially air-dried and used a heat protectant spray and a root-lifting spray before using.

Pros: It’s cheap, it’s all-in-one, and it straightens well. My hair is dry, straight, and shiny. It took the same amount of time as using a regular dryer and round brush (10 minutes). It cools down quickly after use, so you can store it right away.

Cons: It gets HOT. I tried the high setting for just a few seconds, and my scalp was burning and my hair was hotter than after using a flat iron. You can’t change the heat settings during use, so that’s difficult. It’s big and clunky to use. For someone with long hair, the oval shape would probably be great, but with short to medium length hair, it’s unwieldy and it’s hard to dry the underlayers.

The final result: My hair is dry and shiny, but I don’t have anything close to the body and volume that I get with a round brush and dryer. I’ll keep this in my gym bag to use after workouts, but i don’t love it.",3,49,B01LSUQSB0
"Ladies, Please be careful! This completely singed my hair!!! I walked away from the first time I used it full of glee - my hair was straight and long and beautiful, but then i noticed all the flyaways, and then when i tried to wear my head in a ponytail a few days later, i noticed I had bangs where I shouldnt have any bangs!!! My hair scorched off! Be wary of this product. My ends are fried, and it torched my hair.",1,112,B01LSUQSB0
"I was really excited to try this as I thought drying my hair took a long time with a traditional hair dryer. I was surprised at how big the handle is on this thing but it’s not bad. It makes I easy to hold on to. That’s pretty much the only good thing about this. The bristles are good too.
Now to the part that sucks.
This thing takes FOREVER to dry my hair. Mind you I have thin blonde hair. I timed myself from start to finish and this thing took 15+ minutes. I put plus because I didn’t even finish at 15. My hair was still wet at the roots. This thing is terrible at drying your roots. You have to hold it on your scalp basically and it starts to burn. On top of that, you still have to grab hair strand to lift up and put over the top of the dryer *if you wanted some volume* and the hair strands are super hot. I had to pull out my other round brush just to manipulate my hair. I tried flipping my hair upside down like I do with my other dryer, but you’re still not able to successfully dry the roots. I time myself with my traditional dryer and it took me only 7 minutes and it actually dried all of my hair. Roots and all and that’s why it gives me more volume. This one step brush dryer left my hair so flat. I’m highly disappointed. I told myself I was going to use it several times before writing a review. I’m at the point now where I just don’t want to use it anymore. I know it’s not malfunctioning either because it blows very hot air. I just don’t know why it doesn’t dry very good. I think I’ll give this away to someone who might want it.",1,40,B01LSUQSB0
"I was so psyched to get this machine. Having super fine, thin hair I was hoping for the miracle so many people were talking about with this styler. In hindsight, the many videos I watched and reviews I read were from people with thick hair. First off, this thing is heavy and was really hard for me to hold while I was attempting to elicit volume from it, second it gets SUPER hot and third it made my hair super flat compared to using a round brush and blow dryer. Because my hair is so thin and because the barrel is so huge on this I could not get my roots to lift nor could I blow dry my hair upward as I usually do for the lift I need. I think this product is made for people with thick hair that don't need a lot of root lift because for me the only thing it did was flatten my roots and blow out by tips (which if you have thin hair you know this is the exact opposite of what you want-poofy tips and flat roots).",1,56,B01LSUQSB0
"I have long, thick 3b/3c/4a (still learning about textures) hair and let me tell you!!! This blow dryer is the truth. I break my combs and neck blow drying the traditional way. These bristles make sure your hair doesn’t tangle and every section gets thoroughly dry. I will note that if your hair is like mine, it’s not gonna end up bone straight. However - it’s gets a nice body to it after being blow dried and you can definitely wear it as is! I blow dry mine and then twist it for some waves. Easy peasy. I’ve recommended this to all my friends. One more note - the handle is kind of huge. My hand hurt the first time I used it lol",5,46,B01LSUQSB0
"I love this hairdryer!! I bought it because I broke my shoulder and only have the use of one arm. Before my shoulder was broken, I used a very expensive hairdryer and the best brushes. This hairdryer works better than all of my high end products. I'll never go back. The brush is big and I was concerned that it would be too much for my short hair. It will work great on any length hair. The bristles grab even the shortest hair and dry it smooth and soft. My hair is naturally curly and before trying this dryer, I'd dry my hair, straighten it and then use hot rollers. I am now achieving the same results with the Revlon dryer. I haven't written a review on a product in years but needed to share my experience with this dryer. It's worth every penny!",5,641,B01LSUQSB0
"I was hesitant, but after reading the reviews figured I give it a go. Upon plugging it in the air flow seemed very low and I thought that I would take forever and a day to dry my thick hair, even though it is cut into a short bob, so I packaged it up for return. After it sat for a few days, for some unknown reason I opened it back up and gave it a shot, and am I glad I did. It took more than 10 minutes off my dry time and my hair was as smooth as if I used a flat iron due to the metal base. There are three temperature settings which is good, as the hottest setting may be too much for some hair. I use the cool air to hold the final shape. I thought that it would be too large for my hair length, but it keeps it from getting tangled, as it does with a regular round brush. Gone are the days of my struggle with a round brush and dryer. I can't believe it, but I no longer dread blowing out my hair! With every hair compliment I'm sharing the news of this product!",5,57,B01LSUQSB0
"So first off I was incredibly skeptical about purchasing this product... I was convinced that this was another gimmick and that there was absolutely no way this would work on my hair for the following reasons:

1) When I normally blow dry my hair, it looks like I stuck my finger in an electric socket when I'm done.
2) The only way to eliminate the frizz is to flat iron my hair once I'm done blow drying it, which leaves me with crazy fly aways.
3) I'm completely inadept at using hair tools. I'm lucky I can use a brush let alone anything else.

So knowing all that, why did I make this purchase? I HATE having to blow dry and flat iron my hair everyday! It not only takes forever, it's incredibly damaging. I didn't have high hopes, and when I took it out of the box and couldn't find any instructions I resigned myself to thinking that this would be thrown into the large pile of hair tools that I would never use again. Miraculously, when I turned on the dryer (I only used the low setting), I realized right away that it was incredibly easy to use. To my disbelief, when I was finished with my hair, it looked as if I had just left the salon! It was completely straight, smooth and silky without a flyaway in sight. Now I will admit, I didn't quite achieve the volume I was hoping for, but I have very fine hair, and I've only used it a couple of times. I'm hoping once I play around with it a bit more, I'll figure that out. It wasn't that my hair was so flat it was matted to my head but it wasn't voluminous like some of the pictures from other reviewers. Nevertheless, it has never been so easy to do my hair and to look like I actually had half a clue what I was doing. I'm even thinking of purchasing a back up in case this one breaks. If you're as skeptical as me and you're having doubts, go for it! You will not regret it!",5,52,B01LSUQSB0
"I purchased this after a friend recommended it. I have fine medium length hair (4"" past shoulders) and this works amazingly on my hair. It doesn't tangle, gives volume, and is much easier to manage then the blow dryer/roll brush combo. I divide my hair into three sections starting with lower/base of hair drying my way up. The whole process takes maybe less than 15 minutes from starting with wet hair just out of the shower. It also works great for next day hair to work out any waves or kinks from sleeping.",5,61,B01LSUQSB0
"***Update***
I loved this tool when I first bought it. Unfortunately, after a month or so of using it 1-2x per week, I noticed my hair falling out in CLUMPS. In the shower. While brushing. While just sitting on the couch. On my clothes. Everywhere. Excess shedding beyond belief. The heat damage is unreal. I literally had to cut off all my hair yesterday due to being past the point of no return. It is super easy to fall in love with this product because it makes your hair so beautiful looking. Watch for warning signs and stop using immediately if you are noticing a lot of hair on the bathroom floor or on the brush itself. This tool gets incredibly HOT and has the potential to fry your locks. Be careful, loves !!

***Original review***
I cannot tell you how happy I am with this product. I have very fine, over-processed blonde hair that has suffered years of coloring and heat tools. I have never been able to achieve the salon look myself (soft, no frizz, volume). I can never figure out how to blow dry while using a round brush. This tool has been a god sent! It is soo easy to use. My hair looks absolutely amazing and I am soo happy to be able to FINALLY skip my flat iron - absolutely no need to!!!! There is zero frizz and my hair lays perfect. Cheers to healthy hair!!",1,38,B01LSUQSB0
"I wasn’t too hopeful that this would work for me, but I’m pleasantly surprised! I have very thick, medium length hair. When left to its own devices, it’s not straight but not curly. Not even waves per se, in the cute way, but just big and messy looking. My usual routine is to let it air dry for a bit, blow dry it and either use a flat iron to make it straight, or a curling wand for loose curls. This new fangled device allows me to just blow it straight, no flat iron needed. Saves me about 15 min or so, and hey, that’s a big deal in the morning! It’s not hard to use whatsoever. I’m the type that cannot work a round brush with the blow dryer, looking in the mirror either.

In a nutshell, I’m glad I bought this. It’s worth the money for the time saved over all!",5,53,B01LSUQSB0
"I have a cosmetology and hair dressing background. I owned the original version of this product (included in pictures) and it was TERRIBLE. I honestly think it was a design flaw.

I have been seeing people RAVE about this and I had to give it a shot.

I literally just got it delivered like 15 minutes ago and I unboxed it and used it on my damp and very wavy hair.

BRILLIANT!!! The design made it ridiculously easy to use and I did my whole head in like 5 minutes.

It’s the best blowout I may have ever received. Not a salon (in the 20+ years I’ve been getting my hair done) has managed to give me what this little device just did!

I love the color! It has a long cord and if you look at the top, you can use your other hand at the top if needed. I only needed to on the top.

I can’t tell you enough about this - BUY IT! 🥰

UPDATE: still obsessed!! My hair almost seems healthier using this bad boy! I’m adding another picture as well.",5,34,B01LSUQSB0
"I loved this product so much that I bought it TWICE and referred many family members on to it. I had to buy it twice because the first one I purchased broke.... I admit maybe at my own fault because I used an adapter to plug it in while in Europe. I purchased a second one, because I assumed this was my own fault and now my second one is dying out to no fault of my own. One day the hot air stopped working and now only cold air comes out. This is the best version of a handheld hair dryer/brush combo... but I just cant see spending another $50 on this (on top of the $100 that I've already spent). I didn't use it every day (wash my hair once every 3 or so days) and don't need to use it for longer than 15/20 minutes at a time. While it works good while it lasts, it quickly dwindles over time. My sister bought one and her ""high"" setting doesn't work, it only shoots out air on ""low"". Beware of the money you're spending.",1,46,B01LSUQSB0
"Was initially very impressed, but strangely it stopped working after only 5 weeks of use. Was drying my hair and it started smoking and make a loud popping noise so I quickly shut it off. When I tried to turn it back on, it would not work and the handle was very hot. Unfortunately this happened 5 days after return window! $60 is too much for a hair dryer that only works 5 weeks!!",1,78,B01LSUQSB0
"I'm a bit of a skeptic. I take that back, I'm a lot of a skeptic, so I ordered this expecting to have this wonderful hair tool fully fail every expectation I had and every claim Revlon made. Well, now I'm a believer! I timed my hair the other day from fully wet (about 5 minutes after my shower and with my hair wrapped in a towel during that time) to dry and it was 5 minutes. 5 MINUTES!!!!! Now, I only did a few hair curls in the front because I was rushing to work, but it looked voluminous and shiny. I have told every co-worker about it and they cannot believe my hair only took 5 minutes. On NYE, I spent time clipping my hair up and slowing going through each piece with the little flip at the bottom and it still only took 15 minutes from wet to dry. Believe, my friends! I highly, highly recommend this!",5,41,B01LSUQSB0
"THIS TOOL IS DANGEROUS!! It BURST INTO FLAMES when I was using it last night. Literal fire coming out of the end with the cord WHILE IT WAS IN MY HAIR! It burnt my finger and almost caught my entire head on fire! DO NOT BUY THIS! It was easy and convenient and I loved it at first (bought in Jan) I’ve used it maybe 20xs since I bought it. A week ago it started shorting out when it was at certain angles and then last night it caught fire!!! It really needs to be pulled off the market. It’s a major fire hazard!!

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK",1,34,B01LSUQSB0
"I have waist-long relatively thick hair. It usually takes me 35-40 minutes to straighten it (after fully dried) with the flat iron. So here are some points I would emphasize:

Pros:

-Cut down the overall time twice
-easy to handle, lightweight
-detangles and brushes hair at the same time
-it works as a hair dryer+flat iron since it blows hot air and at the same time your hair slides on the hot core when you pull the tool down, and this resembles flat ironing.
-better for those who have thinner hair
-adds volume

Cons:

-very noisy
-it did straighten eventually but it was too hard to control the tips cause you can't hold them, so they run loose through the brush
-it did not add shine to my hair, unlike a flat iron, cause this is a more rough way to straighten with probably less heat damage
-you can't get to the roots since the device is big
-there are only two temp. levels, low and high. I set it on high since low is too low for my hair. But high was too hot, so I could not keep the tool close to my ears and straighten the hair on the temples well.

Hope this will help.",4,37,B01LSUQSB0
"Loved this tool at first as it made hair styling so much faster and easier. However, after using it about 4-5 times, I noticed the bristles started bending and breaking as well as a strong burning smell. Touching my hair strands burnt and my hair started breaking. Finally, the way bristles are makes it impossible to clean so you will also get an accumulation of hair products overtime. This review is not about the seller: product shipped very fast and arrived in condition described. I would definitely not recommend the product: great concept poorly executed.",1,38,B01LSUQSB0
"I REALLY wanted to love this product, I have somewhat wavy thick hair that by using a round brush I can get a straight shiny look, but if I could combine it into one tool....well nope. This thing MESSED up my hair. You have to part your hair in sections, ok, not saving any time and the HEAT...oh lord. I just came from the salon spending $150 on an olaplex treatment and another $75 for the haircut to minimize the split ends and breakage this machine caused. Its TOO HOT to be holding your hair against in order for it to dry. With a dryer I can hold it away from my hair and then use the round brush and close heat to finish the style...you cannot use this that way and even the cool setting is hot! Just look at my pic, I couldn't find another method to measure the heat and this meat thermometer ONLY GOES TO 120... it's way hotter than that. I am realistic, I use a flat iron at 395 degrees but it's for seconds...your hair HAS to stay against this thing! All these people posting rave reviews and silly smooth hair- I would love to see the video of how they managed that....DO NOT BUY THIS!!! I have never posted a review like this but it had to be done! I really believed in this thing...ugh.",1,29,B01LSUQSB0
"Love this! I have mid-long curly, thick hair - and I got my hair done easily and looking shiny and straight! Wish it wasn’t that bulky but I’ll take it. Does a really great job!",5,32,B01LSUQSB0
"I read the reviews before I purchased knowing full well that there is a lot of discussion about how this hair styler doesn't last very long and all these reviews are 100% true and it is 100% UNFORTUNATE. I didn't realize how great this product was going to be and how much of a game changer this would be for my hair styling process. This product gives you hair salon blow outs just like if you were to use big round brush and a blowdryer, the only issue is that I AM INCAPABLE of getting that look for some reason with a brush and blowdryer. My arms just don't compute with what i am trying to achieve. This product made it SOOOOOO EASY to get a blow out which gave my hair beautiful volume AND allowed me to achieve that nice curl because I would take a curling iron to it after which is much better then blow drying hair dry, then using an iron to straighten the curls and then trying to curl stick straight hair. Is it just me who does that? ahah

UNFORTUNATELY I woke up this morning to do my hair and alas, it happened. The blow dryer NO LONGER BLOWS HOT AIR which means its USELESS. I've used it MAYBE 5-6 times. It was completely worth it when it worked but it no longer works after a short period of time using it.

The ONLY benefit of this product was that it showed me that I need this all-in-one hair dry styler and so now I have to look at the more expensive options which hopefully wouldn't crap out like this revlon one did. Boy oh boy am I mad that mine broke, but rest assured I plan to buy another one JUST NOT THIS PIECE OF CRAP! :(",1,33,B01LSUQSB0
"My hair length is half way between ear & shoulder. My hair is fine and not as thick as it used to be. I get tired of daily setting my hair in volumizing rollers or using curling iron which I know is hard on my hair (and occasionally my face). Both ways take a lot of time,

This ""air brush"" takes far less time, definitely gives me volume, and gives me a soft curl around the face I much prefer. I towel dry my hair, first use the full setting, then near the end reduce the setting to the lower setting to finish. I have not used the non-heat setting & can't imagine why I would.
After using for sometime, I believe the high setting gets hotter than I realize so that I am seeing breakage. Now I use the high setting until hair still damp, then turn to the low setting much sooner.",5,31,B01LSUQSB0
"I have owned this dryer for approximately six months now. At first I was very excited about it and recommended it to my family and friends. It gave my fine curly medium length hair a nice smooth blowout without needing a curling iron or flat iron. And it accomplishes this in about 5 minutes for my hair type. That made me really happy. But, after several months of daily use, I noticed that the bristles on one side of the dryer were completely bent over. I feel like this is not good for my hair as pulling those bent bristles thru my hair will cause breakage. I also noticed a lot of split ends, much more than normal so I’ve cut down on how often I use this dryer. I still think it works well if you’re looking for a nice blowout, but I would advise people not to use it every day. It is also VERY hot so between the heat and the pulling on the hair as you use it, I’m convinced it’s causing damage to my hair.",3,29,B01LSUQSB0
"This dryer was okay, it’s very loud and gets super hot. Makes the hair super frizzy. If your not using a good thermal protector when using this you will burn your hair. It’s faster to blow dry and straighten your hair. Wasn’t happy with it. I will be returning it.",3,23,B01LSUQSB0
"If you are in any way debating the purchase of this magical hair wand, PLEASE debate NO LONGER! My hair is down to my waist, yes, my waist... and although it is naturally on the thin side .. it has always been a multi-step task to get it looking nice, shiny and smooth (all at once) and forget volume - as it has always been an impossible achievement (except when I would go to the hair salon of course, but that’s totally obvi.). Frizz seems to be my best friend here in Florida .. woohoo! so one of my fellow alumni sorority sisters posted on our alumni chat how great this product is and how it hasn’t changed her life... and I must admit even after reading all the amazing reviews (well mostly amazing) I still hesitated a bit before pressing the order button; but the fact that I’m a full time working mommy and wife with very little time on my hands gave me the final push .. and boy am I glad I did! My drying time has been cut in half.. what before took 2 hair tools (I would first use my hair dryer and then my hair iron so, results were also pin straight ALWAYS) now is done with only 1 hair tool which not only leaves my hair shiny, frizz free and super smooth but also with some volume!! I would without a doubt pay $400 for this product if that’s what it cost, it’s THAT GOOD ladies!! Please do yourself a favor and buy it... you can thank me later..",5,31,B01LSUQSB0
Used it for the first time and love it! But my dry time down and my hair is so much smoother! I was skeptical but my hairdresser mentioned this and I'm in love! I have thick hair that's super curly in the back and this made it so easy. Only downside is it's heave so my arm was on fire by the time I was done.,5,25,B01LSUQSB0
"I did a ton of research before I purchased this and felt confident in my choice to buy. I was thinking it would be better for my hair since you have to let your hair air dry 80% before using this tool. I thought great! Less time using a heating product will be better for my hair. NOPE! The first time I used it I liked it. It didn't do as good of a job at smoothing out my hair or giving it volume like a traditional blowout with a round brush but it was super fast and easy. I dreamed of hot summer days and being done with my hair in just a few minutes instead of baking in the hot bathroom that turns into a sauna after a few minutes of a blow dryer. My ended didn't feel great but I figured that was because I used a heat protection spray that I don't typically use. Fast forward to the 4th time I used the Revlon One Step Dryer after experimenting with different tricks. My ends are fried! I have to get a haircut that I was not planning on getting because my ends are so yucky from this. I've done a full blowout with a round brush and blow dryer since using the Revlon tool and my hair feels a little better but my ends are garbage after using the Revlon tool. I'm not sure if it is because my ends aren't getting stretched and smoothed out like they do with a round bristle brush and hair dryer or if the heat is too hot or that I can't shoot a blast of cold air like I do with the dryer but I do know that my ends are permanently damaged from the Revlon tool. Could it be my hair is fragile? Maybe. My hair is wavy and thin and color treated but in general good health. Until I burnt the crap out of it with this tool. Unless you have thick super healthy, resilient hair - I'd stay away from this product!",1,22,B01LSUQSB0
"The first time I used it, I loved it. The second time, it stopped working in the middle of drying my thin, shoulder length hair. When I tried to use it the third time, it started to smoke and wouldn't turn on. I'm very disappointed that it only lasted for one use!",1,44,B01LSUQSB0
"The idea is great but the quality is dissappointing. It's already lost one of the speeds - providing only a cool and hot setting instead of cool, low and high. What really bugs me about it is the bristles have somehow bent. I have no idea how this has happened since I always hang it up when not in use.",2,56,B01LSUQSB0
"The manager at my hair salon recommended this to me while chatting one day that my hair never looks as good or even similar to how my stylist dries my hair. I’ll also add she uses this (bought at a big box store) and her hair looked great so I decided to try it. Holy cow this is the bomb. Dries my hair without the “wrinkles” that would come when trying rather unsuccessfully to dry my hair and manage a brush at the same time. I could never get my hair smooth and sleek.
With this baby my hair is smooth and stays looking this way for days. It is loud, and a tad heavy and the cool setting isn’t all that cool but I’ll take all those things considering how great my hair now is post wash/dry. Yahtzee!!",5,22,B01LSUQSB0
"Since all bloggers and influencers rave about this, I decided to make use of this Amazon Prime Special. Let preface that it gave me a ton of volume with so much ease; however, it was so damaging! I let my hair air dry about 95 percent. I had a heat protectant coated in my hair. I used the low setting and it was still hot. I then switched back forth between low and cool. The cool setting is very warm. Although my style was amazing, with a ton of volume, the style didn’t last days. I noticed the very next day my ends were fried and broken off. My hair stylist made a comment and asked if I am still using my products (olaplaex and conditioning mask). Sadly, I only used this styler once to have so much damage. It’s not worth it. Now, I cut my hair shorter to fix the damage. My hair was so healthy before using this. Save your hair and your money. Stay away",1,23,B01LSUQSB0
"PROS: Creates glossy, silky. smooth hair styles best for long, thick hair. Removes unwanted waves and curls. Dries and styles very quickly.
CONS: Really too big for shoulder length or shorter, and layered styles. Straightens hair, removes body.

I have layered, slightly longer than shoulder length hair that is fine textured but thick. As hair classifications go, it is ""2A"" or as I used to call it, ""wavy-straight."" I color it and it tends to be dry, especially at the ends. I usually style it by blowing it dry with a 2"" round brush, which creates waves and lots of long lasting body.

This Revlon One Step dryer-brush has gotten lots of hype and I was curious to see how it would work for my hair.
I searched it out in retail beauty stores. I've held it in my hand and was concerned that the brush head, which is 4.25"", would be too large a surface for my layered, mid length hair. It's a big and fairly heavy device and felt clunky. I was also concerned about the heat burning my hair.

When Amazon Prime Day came, I fell for the super duper price and bought the One Step.

The brush head is a flattened oval with bristles. The hair is supported well by the bristles which keeps the hair close to the openings in the brush. There is no knotting or catching of the hair which is able to run smoothly through and around the bristles as it dries.

There are three heat settings: ""Hot,"" ""Warm,"" and ""Cool."" The controls are at the end of the brush handle, and while well marked, are nearly impossible to change while using the device. I'm used to a hand held pistol-shaped dryer that allows one to switch temperatures, air strength, or from hot to cool on the go...with one hand. I have yet to be able to do this with the One Step.

You divide your hair into manageable sections and run the brush repeatedly through the hair from roots to ends until it is dry and styled. If you place the shorter end of the oval close to the scalp, you will get some lift. If you place the wider sides of the oval close to the scalp, you will straighten and flatten your hair. If it is long enough, you can wrap your hair around the brush as it dries. If you place the short end of the oval at your ends and hold the brush for a few seconds, you'll get a small wave or flip.

I found that the One Step dried my thick hair very quickly, faster than with a round bristled brush. My hair was very smooth, glossy, and close to my head. I would have preferred more ""root-lift"" especially at the crown, but I have had professional blow outs that looked similar to what I got with the One Step. All in all, the results were surprisingly good...even for such a large brush head.

Instructions warn that if you have fine or dry hair to only use the ""Warm"" and not the ""Hot"" setting. This is very good advice and it should be followed. Only use the ""Hot"" setting if you have very thick, wavy, curly coarse hair.

NOTE:

If you check out the product page, you will notice that Revlon has a comparison picture of this ""One Step 4.25"" Head"" brush and a smaller headed brush device which it recommends for shorter or layered or wavier hair styles. This smaller device is called ""The Titanium Max, 2.4"" head.""

Before I purchased this ""One Step 4.25 head,"" I went in search of the 2.4"" version. A large box store that starts with a ""C"" and ends with an ""O"" has an exclusive on this item, and of course, it was completely sold out. This smaller headed item was not on the Revlon web site. I contacted Helen of Troy (who makes these items for Revlon) Customer Service. The CS rep seemed to know nothing about the ""Titanium Max"" but told me, incorrectly that the ""One Step"" on Amazon had a 2.4"" head. She also told me that a 1.5"" headed brush dryer might be released by around the end of December. So, Revlon knows a good thing when it sees one and is expanding the line, but has yet to update it's Customer Service department with any correct or meaningful information.

NOTE: I revisited the C****O web site and was able to purchase a single ""Revlon One Step Titanium Max 2.4"" Head"" dryer brush. It should arrive in about five days. I'll review it on the bottom of this review after I play around with it a bit.

NOTE 11/5/2020: C****O cancelled my order for the Titanium Max 2.4 Head. Sigh.

After a bit of research I discovered that the Hot Tools brand is also owned by Helen of Troy and has a One-Step brush drier in the smaller 2.4"" size virtually identical to the one described (but unavailable) from Revlon.

I settled on the Hot Tools Professional Black Gold One-Step 2.4"" which I purchased from Amazon for twice the price of the Revlon One Step. I selected the Black Gold because it had a ceramic coating that is supposedly best for fine, easily damaged hair. The head is also removable and can be exchanged with a 4.2"" head, should I wish to purchase one separately. I like having that option. I'm going to try out the new Hot Tools for several weeks and will review it then.",4,13,B01LSUQSB0
"Even with a heat protectant & not leaving it on a section of hair too long, it fried my hair so much I had to cut the damaged part off. I didn’t continue to use it to dry the rest of my hair.",1,28,B01LSUQSB0
"I really wanted to love this hair dryer-styler, but after a month of using it, I find it does way more damage to my hair than the convenience factor, which is undeniably high. My hair is looong (mid back), thick, coarse-ish with loose curls and a big nest of frizz if I don't use styling products. So my regular hair care routine is wash + condition, argan oil, dry with a hair dryer on the cool air setting, flatten it out to ultimate sleekness with my AMAZING flat iron (the 'one pass') and I'm done. Of course this takes 45 minutes at the least, but people who don't see me with my nest, wouldn't believe my hair was ever anything but perfectly manageable! I now have a toddler, and of course I don't have even 1/2 hr at a stretch, so I've been air drying my hair all day. I'm a stay at home, and you'd better be lucky that this is what I am right now- I'd make the perfect horror meme. It's no wonder my baby behaves so well on certain days, he's petrified because his mom gets eaten up every few days by a witch!

This is how I used the Revlon dryer-styler: wash + condition hair, argan oil, wait for hair to be damp and not soaking wet, section off my hair into 4 parts and then go to town with the styler. So while I loved the convenience, literally 25 minutes to dry, tame hair with a nice curve at the edge, this styler was ripping out my hair! Especially in the front and top of my scalp. My hair didn't have tangles during the drying process and I did like the end result of natural looking, wavy hair. But the hair being pulled is akin to hair trauma (based off an article I read that says this eventually causes bald spots), and I'm not about to damage my hair permanently. As much of a styling pain as my hair is, there's lots of it and I intend to keep it this way. Now I'm back to air drying and scaring the baby till the trusty flat iron works it's magic.",2,20,B01LSUQSB0
"I must admit, I didn’t expect much coming from a $35 blow-out brush. BUT OMG WHY DID NO ONE TELL ME ABOUT THIS SOONER? Literally 6 minutes (I timed it) to do my hair. I am so lazy when it comes to doing my hair. I think I’m in love. For those of you who are expecting high quality perfection from a $35 product, stop being so cheap and buy a higher quality one then. You set yourself up for disappointment.",5,19,B01LSUQSB0
"Superrrrrrr recomendadooooo!!!!! En la primera vez me lo hice yo y a mi hija, y conste k mi hija es raraaa, y lo amooooo al igual k yo. Compro muchas cosas para el cabello, pero esto es lo maximoooooo, Chicas no se van a arrepentir.",5,22,B01LSUQSB0
"I liked this dryer at first, but stopped using it for two reasons. First, it is very loud. Second, there isn't good temperature control and the heated setting gets extremely hot. I felt like it was rapidly damaging my hair. I have an older Conair round-brush drier that does a good job but is nowhere near as hot.",1,26,B01LSUQSB0
"I got this a few months ago at the recommendation from a family member. I have VERY curly hair and was tired of using a straightener. This one-step drying is so easy to use (pre-brush out your wet hair first). I can now dry/straighten my thick curly hair in about 5min or less and I have no need to 'touch up' with a straightener. My hair is happier, not as dry, more volume and is shinny after drying for DAYS!

My only issue is, after about a month of using it every 3-4 days 1/2 way through drying on high the motor slows down and has a slightly 'off' smell to it. This happens probably 50% of the time I use it now. Not sure if the motor will last much longer. From others review, I'm thinking this may be an issue with this model. However, that said, if this lasts me for 6+ months, I'm not opposed to purchase this again and will see if maybe I got a lemon. Thus far I'm so happy using this for my hair, I would not hesitate to recommend!",3,20,B01LSUQSB0
"I've been on a mission for years to find the fastest, easiest way to do my hair while causing the least amount of damage. I have fine, shoulder-length hair which has been damaged over the years from constantly using a hair dryer followed by a flat iron. This is literally the only thing I use now! PROS: the smooth barrel means my hair isn't being yanked through a brush or dragged through a flat iron. The bristles feel great on my scalp and they give amazing volume. My hair comes out so shiny that I don't have to use a flat iron AND I don't have to use product. That is HUGE for me. Honestly it is so easy to use that I don't even need to stand in front of a mirror. I just grab sections of my hair and use it like a hairbrush--keep rotating it on each section as I brush my hair, curl over or under depending on what I'm going for. And it dries super fast. For me there are no CONS--this thing has literally changed my life. The only thing I would say is that it is a little heavier than your basic hair dryer, so if you are looking for something super light, this wouldn't be for you. But seriously...if you struggle with thin, fine, fussy hair like I do, this is a total game changer.",5,19,B01LSUQSB0
"This definitely doesn't live up to the Hype or Reviews posted. I would like to clear up the heat/fan setting confusion.... ""Cool"" is medium hot - there is always heat coming out of this thing. I have heard reviews that recommend to blast ""cool"" to set the curls and ""cool"" is no where near room temperature, but rather medium hot. ""Low"" is a fan setting only, still burning hot air, but less of a fan blowing it out. ""High"" is like hell on earth heat. You will burn your skin, neck and scalp on the ""High"". I have used it three times now on 60%-70% damp hair and am switching the unit between cool and low during that time (about every 20-30 seconds). It takes two hands to use it - it is heavy and awkward and you will bang your head trying to get the hang of it (that is when you will burn your skin and scalp). I haven't decided if it is worth the money to keep it or not.",2,14,B01LSUQSB0
"I was so ready to fall in love with this product after the glowing reviews. However, I had a terrible experience with this dryer. Number one, it is very heavy. I was hoping my daughter would be able to use it to dry her hair. It was so heavy she had to stop and take breaks. Number two, I have very long hair. I was only 1/4 of the way started on my hair when the device started to smell like it was burning. Number three, It is very loud and has a high pitched buzz while running. My ears were ringing when I stopped using this product. It is being returned as we speak. So sad",1,30,B01LSUQSB0
"I looooooooove this thing. I love it so much that when my first one blew up when I tried to use it overseas (RIP), I ordered another one so it would be waiting when I got home.

It's been a game changer for my hair, an honest-to-god holy grail product. My hair is super dry, medium thickness, half wavy, half just frizz—it's what other people's hair looks like when they've damaged the hell out of it. But THIS thing dries it faster than a blowdryer and makes it smooth and shiny, which nothing else in the world has been able to do. Depending on how I use it, I can get it straight or give it some really nice bend towards the ends.

If you're wondering whether you should buy it, you should honestly just buy it.",5,22,B01LSUQSB0
I absolutely love this two in one styler! I was so reluctant to spend the money on this but I’m so glad that I did. The styler blew dry my hair in half the time my regular blow dryer takes and I didn’t even have to use my flatiron. I have so much body to my hair!,5,15,B01LSUQSB0
This blow dryer did not work for me! It gets so hot even on low that it burned my hair. I had to get over an inch cut off and I'm still letting some of damage grow off. The thing is that I only used this once a week.,1,35,B01LSUQSB0
"they will not let you write a review if you click on 1 star. it pulls my hair badly, break them like tiny pieces very heavy my right hand wrist and hand grip is seriously effected by this product and left hand little less. horrible product no shine after using this all the claims are lie. you can't use this in wet hair then what the purpose? first you dry your hair with regular hair dryers then this.",1,26,B01LSUQSB0
"I never write reviews (really, I think this is my first one) but I saw this product used by many beauty bloggers and was really excited to try it on my hair. I was looking for some good volume at my roots and a nice bounced under end. Unfortunately it is just not right for my hair type. If you are like me and have coarse, thick, shoulder length hair that takes a long time to dry, this may not be a good fit for you either. The first time I used it, my hair was 80% dry from air-drying. It took forever to get each piece dry and my hair didn’t look great. Thought I would give it another shot a few days later. This time, I blew my hair about 95% dry with my regular blow dryer. Then used the product. After 15 minutes, a tired arm, and a lot of sweating, my hair looked...meh. I still needed to go over it with a straightener to get it completely smooth and my ends curled under like I usually do. So, I am returning because I can already achieve slightly frizzy and dry hair with my blow dryer. BUT - if you have shorter, finer hair that doesn’t take a long time to dry, this probably would work for you.

**Update almost 2 years later! I cut my hair short last year and bought the hot tools gold version of this tool. It is a freaking miracle. I don’t use my straightener at all anymore and I get perfect results. Volume at the roots and bounced under ends. I’d be interested to give this one another shot just to see if my hair needs to be short to use a tool like this, but i like my hot tools version so much that I won’t be switching!",2,19,B01LSUQSB0
I’m a hairstylist so I was a bit skeptical to purchase but I am pleasantly surprised. I would recommend hair being partially dry before starting and not over drying the hair. It does get very hot so do not keep on one spot for too long. If you are having issues with flyaways or static it is because your hair has been overdryed. I have fine thin hair and am able to dry and style in five min! Gives great volume!,5,39,B01LSUQSB0
"I cannot believe that I am about to write an online review for a hair dryer, but this thing is so amazing that I want to be sing its praises from the rooftop. Or, at least from my Amazon reviews.

I am a person with medium length, extremely thick, wavy to curly hair. I'm also a person who hates to do anything with their hair except wash it. I am not a person who buys a lot of products, I do not spend a lot of time watching videos about hairdos, I do not blow dry my hair on any kind of a regular basis. In short, I am hair lazy. I saw an online review for this product, and thought that it might be worth giving it a shot. I was pretty sure that the whole thing was going to be a complete failure, and that I would wind up returning the product to Amazon.

Boy, was I wrong!

This hair dryer is a game-changer for me. It usually takes somewhere between 45 minutes and an hour to blow dry my own hair if I am using a roller brush and trying to do a proper blowout. It is also an exercise in arm aerobics and gymnastics to try and manage this. I am just a person who has no skill for these sorts of things, and no patience. I set the timer on my phone before I started blow drying my hair when I used it for the first time. Start to finish the entire thing took me about 15 minutes. I also used it on my hair right after a shower, towel-dried, but no other removal of water. (I am sure that if my hair had been less wet, it would have taken even less time, which is amazing.)

In 15 minutes I had a beautiful, sleek, soft blow out. I cannot believe it. I am kind of embarrassed to admit that I have been prancing around my house all evening fluffing my hair and running my hands over my head. I seriously cannot get over how amazing this product has made my hair look. As a person who struggles with flyaways, frizzy hair, and those sorts of things, I cannot believe that I can get my own hair to look so nice in such a short period of time. This blow-dryer may actually be the best money I have spent on any kind of hair product in many years!",5,17,B01LSUQSB0
"Absolute life changer. I’m pretty experienced using a regular dryer and a round brush, but a blowout on myself is HARD. I have long hair, and a lot of it. A blowout usually takes more time than I’m willing, I need superhuman arms, and typically have to take a few breaks during. But THIS! This cut my drying time in half. No. MORE THAN HALF. I didn’t have to take any breaks and my hair came out looking better than it does with a round brush and dryer. I cannot stress enough how much I needed this in my life. It’s easy to hold, not too heavy at all, doesn’t get too hot, and the cord wasn’t an issue at all. I’m wondering how no one has thought of this sooner, but I’m grateful to have it now. The return policy made me feel better too, knowing that if it wasn’t working out that I could send it back. But I knew after about 30 seconds of using it that I wouldn’t be returning. SO HAPPY WITH IT! If you love a nice blowout (who doesn’t?), definitely treat yourself to this little gem.",5,13,B01LSUQSB0
Let me just start off with the fact that I absolutely loved this product!! I have between 3b and 3c hair with a couple 3a strands so for anyone with similar hair type I highly recommend. My usual routine for when I straighten my hair would be having to either blow dry or air dry then try and straighten my hair which takes way too long. And even longer if I want to curl it since usually it just looks plain and very flat. I do happen to have more fine hair which is why I don't usually get much volume when I straighten my curls but when I tried this out I kid you not I fell in love with it. All I did was wash my hair then pat off the excess water and once you de-tangled my hair I basically just started brushing with it on hot air and it made my hair looks amazing with the desired volume. Also if you keep turning the brush for a couple seconds you get this really pretty curl type wave look that would usually take me extra time using my wand. The only cons for this is it does get a little loud and the brush is hot so be careful you'll want to make sure to hold each end. Lastly it's not magic lol so you won't get straight hair in one brush. Other than that I give it a 5/5 and I'm honestly surprised that more people don't know about this cause this was such a great find for me and totally worth the money. :),5,256,B01LSUQSB0
"Loved it, until it almost caught on fire +! 4 days and started making a noise, then smoked and is dead now.",1,32,B01LSUQSB0
"I read great reviews about this item and was ready to give it a try.
When I received it the box did not have the seal but I skipped the fact because of how eager I was.
I used it and it did a very good job on my hair. It looked shiny and smooth. But.... when I finished I touched the revlon logo with my finder and it smudged. I slightly rubbed it and it completely disappeared.
I went back to the box thinking there was something strange. I reviewed the manual and it had orthographic and grammatical mistakes.
So I returned it and bought a replacement one a physical store.
I noticed immediately the box was different, it had a seal. The brush was larger than the prior one and the plastic looked higher quality. I touched the revlon logo and it stayed in place. The manual was written in the proper way.
So yes, I am certain that I received a counterfeit item.",1,12,B01LSUQSB0
"Ok, so I've desperately wanted the Dyson air wrap for basically ever. FOREVER. However, I'm super cheap and can't justify spending upwards of $500 on a hair product during Covid quarantine as it seems I'll never be able to leave the house. Thus, no one will care about how my hair looks anyways (except for me and possibly my husband, of course).  

In an effort to find something comparable, I began obsessively looking online for products (i.e. amazon reviews, youtube, ect...). I have a lot of time on my hands thanks to Covid. That's where I found out about the Revlon One-Step Hair Dryer. 

I was a bit nervous because I read reviews that said this basically ruined hair. In the end, I decided to purchase this product because no one would see my hair anyways even if it was ruined (once again, thank you very much Covid). 

I tried this product the first time while my hair was completely wet. It was super easy to dry and style. I have frizzy and curly hair and it made it look PERFECT. Woa, my mind was totally blown by this product. I called my best friend, who basically said my hair looked so perfect it was like I was wearing a wig. I've used this product quite a few times since. It's come out perfect every time.

Ok, I'm totally sold and think you should be too. For $42, I don't believe you will find something better on the market. This product deserves FIVE stars!",5,8,B01LSUQSB0
"I have thick, coarse hair. The picture I have posted is the first time I ever used this. I was thrilled. My hair dried in half the time. It came out beautifully straight with body. My only criticism of this is the temperature control. The high/hot setting is REALLY hot. I fear if you don’t keep it moving, it would burn your hair. I’m constantly switching from that setting to air only, no heat. I wish there was a setting that had high blowing with medium heat. That being said, this is my go to dryer. I have given up on the numerous round brushes with a blow dryer. SO MUCH easier to use, with better results. It’s also much easier to pack when you travel. You won’t be sorry. For people with at least medium length hair however. Don’t think it would work with short hair — very thick barrel.",4,12,B01LSUQSB0

 Love this product! It arrived yesterday and used it today! It gives you a salon quality blow out feeling! I have so much hair and it’s naturally curly and thick but this worked for my hair! It does get hot because it’s a blow dryer so just be aware of that. I will say find a good blow out oil product to go along with this blow dryer too. I was so amazed with the results!!!",5,15,B01LSUQSB0
Stopped working after one week but unfortunately I threw away packing and box. Terrible product defective. Got so hot when I used it that it almost burned my scalp then it just stopped working.,1,32,B01LSUQSB0
".. but the lack of control options wrecks what starts as a Dream of a Styling Tool! I had to choose between High (air flow) w/Hot Heat, Low Air Flow w/Hot heat or High (Air flow) w/Cool - no heat. It dried my hair out terribly on the first try! It looked fried - frizzy - yet I had been just putting it in a bun most of the summer, so it was in great condition. I was so disappointed because I loved the design of the One Step; Revlon is a great company, and there's no clamp or anything to grab my hair like my flatiron does. I really wanted this item to work! But, HOT really was HOT! On most hair drying/ styling tools, a burst of Cool is for setting a style once you're done. There should be choices for temps like Hot, Warm, Cool; and choices for the fan force; High, Med, and Low. This tool is sadly lacking! Revlon - what happened? Good control options would make this tool perfect!",1,13,B01LSUQSB0
"I ordered this at 7am and had it by 4pm which is awesome. I was disappointed to see it is a used product. You can see where someone else's label was ripped off, there are cuts from a razor knife, the box is torn and there is even tape on the box like it was a wrapped gift at one point. I ordered a new product and am disappointed to of received a used unit. Especially during a global pandemic.",1,11,B01LSUQSB0
"I have moderately thin, 3a curly hair that I prefer to wear straight, but I don’t like the flat look that a straightening iron gives me. I got very good at doing a salon style blowout myself, with a very hot hairdryer and a big round brush. It takes me about 25 minutes that way.
This tool (the oval version) cut my drying time down by about half! I have to let my hair get to damp dry first (just like when I do a regular blowout), but this brush is wonderful! The combination of boar bristles to pull hair straight, and regular bristles to comb through tangles means just a couple passes on a small section gives me smooth, straight hair. Plus, unlike other brush style tools I’ve tried, the air this blows out is hot enough to dry hair quickly and lock in shine. Can’t see myself going back to a brush and dryer blowout any time soon.",5,15,B01LSUQSB0
I was so excited to try this product after reading reviews but I was not happy with results. This tool took over 40 minutes to dry my hair and didn’t give it any volume or curl or wave. I take really good care of my hair and almost any tool works on my hair so I was surprised it had no effect on my hair. Instead it actually just broke some of my hairs. :/,1,18,B01LSUQSB0
"How can I return this thing? I LOVED it for the two months that it worked and now it's dead. A burning smell comes out when it's turned on and two of the settings do not work. Only a 30 day return window? Come on Revlon, stand behind your products!",1,34,B01LSUQSB0
I am having to rewrite my review of this product. Initially I was reluctant to order the Revlon One Step Hair Dryer & Volumizer after reading some of the negative comments about the product. I did get the one step dryer and used it for 2 weeks. It as easy to use for drying and adding volume and curl to my hair. It took the two weeks and a trip to my hair stylist to really understand what was going on with my hair. It also left me with scorched hair! My stylist said that she had never seen my hair so dry. I have used the same stylist for over 8 years. I returned my Revlon One Step Hair Dryer. They need to have a temperature control setting to avoid damaging hair.,3,13,B01LSUQSB0
"Wow! I read all the reviews and was thinking of skipping this Superb product. I had to check it out myself and I’m glad I did. The high setting is just what it is High and hot, but the low setting is perfect. You can always push it to high for a few to get that really hot, then back to low. I blow dry my entire head in low and I have thick, corse & long hair. I’m so happy with this purchase and I bought this weeks ago. I used it on my sister and her friends hair as well. Now they both want one. The size of this brush blow dryer was surprising. It’s large, but perfect for making your hair look like you had a blow out without the blow bar price. The quality of the dryer is nice, the Tiffany blue is a lovely soft color which looks good with other high end hair tools. I definitely suggest if you are thinking of getting this product, do so!",5,11,B01LSUQSB0
"I just used this for the first time and WOW. I ended up with smooth, shiny hair without using a flatiron. I'm all in on this - pretty sure I will never go back to a regular hair dryer.

My hair is pretty long and there is a lot of it, so my arms get so tired trying to hold up a heavy hair dryer with one hand and maneuver a round brush with the other. I have never gotten the hang of using a big round brush like they do at the salon - my hair always gets tangled or I just get tired of holding my arms up so high for twenty straight minutes. Most of the time I just end up sitting down and blow drying it upside down, and it usually ends up looking dry and there are always those few broken hairs right at the front of my part that stick straight up, and then I always have to use a flatiron or curling wand to get it reasonably smooth.

This was great for two reasons:
1. You can hold it upright and blow it dry from underneath, meaning you don't have to have your arms all the way above your head the entire time.
2. You can use both hands on one piece of equipment instead of trying to do two separate things at once.

I am so glad I bought this! Wish I had done it sooner.",5,14,B01LSUQSB0
"PROS: extremely easy to use, dries hair quickly, no straightener needed

CONS: IF YOU HAVE FINE HAIR, do NOT buy this product. Extreme breakage. Looks like fly always all over my head EVERYWHERE. Fries hair off about 1 inch from scalp.",1,11,B01LSUQSB0
"*I have only used this one time so I can't say whether or not it stops working after just a few uses or damages hair like some have said.*

I have VERY difficult hair. It's long, wavy/curly, and SO FRIZZY. It is very delicate and breaks easily.

I drenched my hair in It Leave in Miracle (i swear by this product for frizzy hair!) after washing, then I let my hair air dry for about half an hour in a microfiber towel. It was still pretty wet when I went to use the tool. This tool is easy to use. Many people have written that it's too big but I like the size. My hair dried in about 35-40 minutes and looked like I used a flat iron on it. So for this tool to dry AND straighten all at the same time is amazing.

I will not be using this regularly because I don't want any heat damage on my hair.

The reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars is that it really did not volumize my hair at all.

Very fast delivery and great price.",4,6,B01LSUQSB0
"I want to love this dryer. It gets hot and works well on mine and my daughter’s-it works best when our hair is mostly dry and just a little damp. Drying super wet hair is much harder with this.

My biggest complaint is that whenever I have it in the high setting, it is soooo loud. But not just loud, it’s high pitches and annoying, almost like a shrieking sound. It’s sooo obnoxious. I don’t know if mine is faulty or if they all sound that way. On the low setting it doesn’t do this, but on the high or cool setting it does.",3,9,B01LSUQSB0
Very disappointed in this. I was so excited to get it but when I started to use it I noticed it wasn’t really working. I have very thick frizzy hair and this product would have taken at least 2 hours to dry my hair completely! I have a Revlon hair dryer and it takes me about 15-20 minutes to dry my hair. I thought that this hair dryer brush would reduce my hair drying time but it definitely does not. Some of the bristles on the brush look like they are burned from the heat too. I would say this product is for people with thin hair. Definitely returning this.,1,12,B01LSUQSB0
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 LOVE this tool! I did give it 4/5 for warmth because the high heat setting does get warmer than I would like. Otherwise, it’s lightweight and dries very fast and gives a lot of volume!! My hair is SO thin and straight so it always looks flat. This helped a lot! I would recommend letting it air dry about 70-80% just to avoid using so much heat, but it was a great product whether you’re using from completely wet or partially dry.",5,7,B01LSUQSB0
"I've always struggled with coordinating the motion of a brush and blow dryer in two separate hands. Maybe it's just me, maybe it's because I didn't start styling my hair until I was an adult, maybe the two halves of my brain just don't like each other... but that's the truth, and it has made me shy away from blowing out my hair, even though I have a short hair and it doesn't take long. Enter this product and... wow. Styling my hair is easy and... fun??

The outcome with this product isn't substantially different from the traditional blow dryer + brush technique, but it is SO much easier to achieve. I haven't succeeded at getting a lot of crown volume with this brush in the way I can with a blow dryer, but that might be a learning curve. My hair is between chin- and shoulder- length, and it takes me maybe 10 minutes to style my hair from damp with this product. I use my free hand (which would usually hold my round brush) to move my hair around and press it into the barrel, which is so much more intuitive than trying to use a brush to manipulate the hair towards/around a blow dryer. This product is bigger than you expect (2-3x the size of a normal round brush), but it's light for its size. The swiveling cord is a must for a product like this, and it functions well.

The one negative thing I've noticed, which knocks my review down from 5 to 4 stars, is that the metal barrel of the brush gets very hot after a few minutes on ""High."" This isn't fundamentally a bad thing as the heat of the barrel helps to straighten your hair, but it can make it unpleasant if your free hand bumps the barrel or if you're maneuvering close to your scalp. This doesn't happen on ""Low,"" so I recommend starting on ""High"" to dry your roots and any especially wet spots, then switch to ""Low"" for the rest of your styling.",4,6,B01LSUQSB0
"Mmmm not sure yet. Heavy and huge plus the Brisles hurt my scalp like no other. This brush is a monster. Oval in shape, not round and wow super heavy. So if you have carpal tunnel or anything weak with your wrist forget about it. I did use it tonight and my hair is super straight. I have thick black hair and it left it silky but it came at a heavy coat. I put a photo of this brush next to a regular hair brush!",3,18,B01LSUQSB0
"I bought this based on my sister's wonderful review, she has long thick coarse hair and after using it she has a bouncy full head of hair and very manageable. I used it and was curious if it would work on my above the shoulder length hair and guess what?? it worked, it literally took minutes to dry and straighten my hair with some body in it. I did use a heat protectant before I started like I would with any blow dryer. Woke up the next and only had to run my fingers through my hair. I definitely love this tool . the only think maybe negative is that it is kind of bulky but not too hard to handle. A total must have on everyone's vanity!",4,7,B01LSUQSB0
"As soon as I have recieved this brush, I wanted to try it. In just a few seconds, I knew there was something wrong. The noise it made (even on its lowest mode) and the smell of it were TERRIFYING. It smelled like something was burning, and out of the hundred brushes I have, none of them made such a sawmill noise. I still tried it on my hair. But let me tell you that I was shaking with fear that it would burn my hair or explode in my hand. And it did : I heard like a mini explosion, then quickly removed it from my hair, then I saw a red coulour inside the brush (if this had been in contact with my hair it would've burnt), then I switched it off. There was a burnt smell in the whole room. I switched it on a few times again to see what was wrong, and it ended up dying in my hands. There was smoke coming out, and I couldnt switch it on again since then.
This is the most disappointing experience I ever had with a hair product. I can't believe Revlon is selling such a dangerous thing, ffs it could've burnt my hair !!!!!!! Please girls protect your hair's health from such risky items.",1,12,B01LSUQSB0
"I loved this product.....that is until I had to keep replacing it for $55 a pop. I first received it as a Christmas gift. That one burned out in less than a year. I replaced it. Then that one burned out even more quickly, about 9 months. I ordered another one (I said I loved it!), then that one only lasted FOUR MONTHS. I think I'll just buy the cheaper one this time. I wouldn't recommend unless you've got money to ""burn""",2,16,B01LSUQSB0
"I have thick curly dark middle eastern hair that doesn’t tame well. I’m typically the roll my curls into a bun for days because I can’t deal with it any other way type gal. I hate using a hair straighter because it never works and my hair is too long and thick for ironing curlers.

This thing is a work of art, so far I’ve used it 4 times and it’s completely blown out my hair beautifully. I pair it with the beach bum hair protection spray and the Living Proof frizz cream and it rocks. My hair is soft and smooth and actually manageable. I usually only get this type of relief when I get a hair trim and beg my hair stylist to blow dry afterwards. It’s about as close to salon as I can do by myself. Like others said, it does get really hot so be careful, and the brushes are already wearing down (I have so much hair!) that I wonder how long it’ll last before it’s gotta be replaced. Fingers crossed! Definitely worth a buy!",5,9,B01LSUQSB0
"I am immediately returning this. I purchased it after great reviews, tried it on a small section of hair on high, and knew I just had to get used to it. Mind you, I have very straight normal thickness of hair, so usually brushes and other tools have no issues. I can only imagine for those who have curly or wavy hair. Anyways, tried it a second time tonight - again on high, but then it legit got WAY too hot again. I tried switching to the low setting - AND IT DIDN'T EVEN WORK! I tried unplugging and replying, resetting - nothing. So it’s going back tomorrow and I will stick with my John Frieda hot hair tool forever because it works well, much cheaper and I’ve had it for over 2 years and still kicking. Oh and it was only like $25. So, I do not recommend this product at all.",1,10,B01LSUQSB0
"Quality control department sucks!!! (If there is one ) I received this blow dryer with someone else's hair in it! Ewwww... disgusting
If not for that I would have given it 5 stars since it did a good job in making my hair curly frizzy hair smooth and straight; (that is after I gloved up removed that hair and disinfected the whole thing with alcohol)
I was too impatient to return this one and reorder another one, and even that wouldn't give me a guarantee that the new one wouldn't be used just the same...",2,86,B01LSUQSB0
I love it,5,12,B01LSUQSB0
"This thing is great. I have a ton of hair (see pictures.) and it’s curly and difficult to manage. My hair is thick and takes forever to dry. I ordered this thinking it would be *alright* at best. I was wrong. I was able to go from wet hair to completely dry and mostly straight hair in about 20 minutes. That’s unheard of for me. There are a couple of things to mention however: Firstly this thing is massive. The barrel is easily twice the size of a large round brush. It worked for me, but if you don’t have a lot of hair or if it’s short idk how well it would work for you. Secondly, the “stay cool” end. Doesn’t stay cool. By the end of the process it was just as hot as the rest of the barrel so keep that in mind. Overall, I highly recommend! Just to note the first picture is after using this dryer and the second picture is my hair dry brushed with a normal brush. Huge difference!",5,5,B01LSUQSB0
"Saw this on one of those buzzfeed lists of things that I needed to own in my life and was sucked in lol. I do actually really like it! I have SUPER thick wavy hair and usually just put some gel in it and let it air dry b/c it takes freaking forever to blow dry and style. This took me less than 10 minutes to dry my hair (still took the normal 20 minutes or so to curl afterwards, it didn't cut down on my styling time), I loved that I was able to just use this and not have to try to hold a blow dryer AND a hairbrush at the same time! Definitely a game changer!

My two small complaints are 1. this thing is SUPER loud! Not the end of the world but it's much louder than my current blow dryer. 2. it's HUGE. The brush is seriously about the size of my entire face which I was really surprised by. This does I think allow your hair to dry much faster b/c of the large surface area but it doesn't allow you to get as close to your scalp as I'd like. If you have short hair I do not think this would not work well for you because of the size, I'd say you really need to have at least shoulder length hair for this product.

Long story short, if you have thick long hair I'd definitely recommend this!",4,8,B01LSUQSB0
"I was intrigued by so many rave reviews and thought I was missing out on something that might make my hair full, bouncy, and salon-styled. You know the old saying ""if it sounds too good to be true it probably is""? Well, that fits my experience. The dryer is big & bulky, but I expected that, so it's not a complaint, just an observation. Anyone with long hair may be tempted to get this dryer. Fact: it will dry your hair. It will add a curl to the end if that's what you're going for. Here's my gripe: even on a low heat setting it's still hot as its directly on your hair. I for one do not want to dry out my hair. I won't even go that close with a regular dryer. Second gripe, I didn't get volume. Top of my hair was flat. Now, I bet people with wavy hair looking for a fast way to get straight hair would totally benefit from this product. Or if you're blessed with really thick and hard to dry hair, this might be perfect for you. But for me, with 'heavy' ( not to be confused with thick), pinstraight hair, this just didn't live up to the hype. I went back to my old dryer. For what it's worth, I did give 2 of these as gifts prior to getting myself one. One recipient had super thick hair and the other had wavy hair. Both said they loved it...",,7,B01LSUQSB0
"I originally gave this a 5 star review. I loved it just like everyone else because it was so simple and gave me a straight hair after the shower. PLEASE DO NOT BUY OR USE!!!!!! DO NOT USE!!!!! Someone else who gave it a one star summed it up perfectly so I will quote her:
“I started noticing my hair was thinning and eventually a large section of it looked as though it was fried. I realize that the metal used in between the brissals was getting so hot that it was burning my hair and overtime eventually led to major hair loss.”

This is exactly what happened to me. The funny this I read her exact review before I bought it. I thought about what she said but was so convinced by the thousands of good reviews so I bought it anyway. Like her (and everyone else), the first few weeks were great. After about 2 months though, I noticed my hair thinning and it became extremely damaged/fried. I was so dumb to not realize it was this brush that was causing it the entire time. I now have an appointment to cut my hair and try to repair the damage. Please, please do not buy! Although the damage is not immediate, it will happen.",1,9,B01LSUQSB0
"I have a lot of very curly hair. I have never liked to blow dry it because it takes forever, and to then get smooth straight hair, I had to use a straightener. Double work, extremely long time. This thing is MAGIC! It dries, straightens, and smooths all at the same time. And it takes about 10 minutes. I recommend using it while hair is still pretty wet. I used it once on hair that was only damp, and the frizz was still there.",5,6,B01LSUQSB0
"The letters melted off and it smelt burnt just from turning on before I used. Only used once but the smell wouldn’t go away, I hadn’t blowed dried my hair or used hot tools in 3 yrs and this def scared me away 😰",1,14,B01LSUQSB0
"Seca el pelo rápido , es cómodo , pero las cerdas que trae en los extremos se dobla con el primer uso",3,16,B01LSUQSB0
"I have extremely long hair, down to my butt. It's not thick, per sé, but it is dense. I stayed FAR away from blow dryers because I knew nothing would make me want to be spending an hour drying my hair. Yet, I did want to style it to get some volume and oomph. I gave this a shot and after using ran out to my boyfriend with joy telling him that this is easily the best thing I've ever bought for my hair. Seriously. I went in the bathroom with soaking hair and came out 10 minutes later with dry, gorgeous, full-bodied hair that was soft, styled, and ready for a night on the town. I LOVE this!!",5,6,B01LSUQSB0
I loved this the first few times I used it. I started noticing short stray pieces of hair sticking up around my hairline and super short hairs at the nape of my neck. I can no longer pull my hair up or back without all these pieces falling out or sticking up. This hairdryer burned off my hair leaving this mess that’ll take years to grow back. I only need to wash and dry my hair once a week so I didn’t even use this a lot. Beware...you won’t botice until it’s too late!,1,10,B01LSUQSB0
"FUNCIONA DE MARAVILLA! Personalmente no voy mucho al salón, suelo lavarme el pelo en casa y dejarlo secar al aire, se me hacen unas ondas suaves y aplico un poco de leave-in. Compré el cepillo para secarme en casa en las ocasiones que quiera tener el pelo mas arreglado y me va super bien. Lo he usado con el pelo húmedo (seca super bien) y también con el pelo seco que es muuuucho más rápido para mi. Al final me paso un poco la plancha en las raíces porque el cepillo es grande y no alcanza bien esa parte.",5,8,B01LSUQSB0
"I've used this at least 3x/week since November of 2019 and I'm reviewing bc I see a lot of bad reviews which I think is a shame. I've had great success with this tool and would recommend it to any of my loved ones! A few things I would also recommend:

1. Use heat protectors on your hair before using this tool, like with all hot styling tools! You should see the product ""burn"" off your hair without changing the texture of your tresses. I've used a spray that helps dry hair faster, also from Revlon, that pairs nicely with this product. I also use a leave-in-conditioner and some heat-proof styling serum on the ends to keep my hair safe.

2. Section your hair into at least 2-3 horizontal sections using hair clips--this helps dry your hair even faster!

3. Try using the low heat setting first. You should only have to go through a section of your hair 1-2 times. If you're going through it 3+ times, then it's either because it's not hot enough, or you're going too fast, or you have too much hair in that section. Keep spinning the tool as you go from your roots to your tips. Pull the tool up as you spin to get to die for volume.

4. Once your hair is all dry, flip the tool to the COOL setting and let it drop temp--then run it through your hair to ""set"" your hair cuticles and decrease the likelihood of frizz throughout the day.

5. I know this sounds like a lot of steps, but to get my hair from towel dried to styled takes no more than 15 minutes because of this tool. Go for it!",5,5,B01LSUQSB0
"Despite all of the raving reviews, I really didn't like this product. First off, it's huge. I have somewhat small hands and using this was pretty difficult. I have medium thickness hair that's down below my collar bones but this thing felt like I needed way longer hair to make it worthwhile. Also, it's LOUD. Like, really loud. My ears were ringing by the time I was done. I really wanted to like it but oh well.",2,14,B01LSUQSB0
"I usually write only positive reviews, but I felt the need to write a review after reading so many good and also negative reviews. I read another review that her dryer started burning. The first day I used this dryer, I could smell something burning. My son also asked what was burning. I thought maybe that's because it was new. I have been using this dryer for a week. Each day the power of the dryer seem to slow down. The burn smell never went away. This morning the dryer stopped working. I believe this dryer is defective and I would buy with caution. I think something was burning inside and it burned out the device. Thankfully, it died out before it started burning. I don't recommend this dryer.",1,5,B01LSUQSB0
Loved the way my hair looked after using this. Gave my hair so much Volume and bounce. BUT it damaged my hair to the extreme! Even just after one use! My hair literally singed and I could smell the burn. I’m so sad because now my hair is not the same even after one use and I through the box away so now I can’t even return it and I’ll never use it. It does have a cool setting but it takes wayyy longer and does not give the same effect. Super bummed,1,8,B01LSUQSB0
"I have always struggled to style my hair. I finally something that makes is super simple!!! I waited until my hair a little damp. I used the low setting. And in less than 15 minutes, my thick curly (permed) hair was straight and stylin! There's no hair gymnastics going on here. I only have this to use. Gone are the hair dryer, and then flat ironing days. It looks like I just stepped out of a salon. <3 I have recommended to other friends and they have loved it also!",5,13,B01LSUQSB0
"I wanted to get the Revlon one step hair dryer for a while but was reading a lot of online reviews about product issues and hair issues. The price went down enough to were I figured the risk of the product not working wouldn't be as steep as full price. So here is my review and experience.

Generally, I do not use hot tools on my hair. It fine and naturally wavy/curly and manageable enough for me without hot tools. However, there are those occasional days where I'm running late to work and need my hair to be dried quickly and thus far the one step hair dryer has worked really well. I use the low heat because my hair is fine and use smaller sections to get the desired results. My hair when it's done being dried and style is smooth, sleek, and frizz free.

The dryer does get hot, especially around the ears (but with smaller sections you only need to go over the area once maybe twice). It is loud. It takes me about 20 mins to completely dry and style my hair. After I turn the product off it is warm and it does make a little noise, the best I can describe it is a small fan slowing down but also trying to cool off the product so it doesn't overheat after you've finished using it.

I can definitely see how this could cause some hair damage pretty quickly if you do not take preventive steps (heat protectant) and use the dryer frequently.

I'm happy with my purchase and will continue to use the product. I think this is pretty revolutionary and love how quickly I can dry and style my hair even when I'm running late.",5,3,B01LSUQSB0
"I bought one just like this. But, the third time I used it, it died...unless I kept turning the electrical cord. I gave up on it and bought this one (looks EXACTLY the same) because it says Revlon...a company I have always trusted. But, while it lasted longer, it died too. Same exact problem!!! The connection from the electrical cord to the dryer failed unless it was turned in a certain direction. So, I ordered ANOTHER one...guess I'm a glutton for punishment. The third one was from a company called Billi something. Ordered on 20 Jan 2019. It's 10 Mar 2019 and it STILL isn't here! Seriously? So, I took the Revlon one and velcro'd the cord to the handle. It kinda worked but kept slipping. So, my next move it to duct tape it. Seriously? Dear LORD in Heaven!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",2,8,B01LSUQSB0
Way bigger than I expected! Didn’t convey in description. Must have very long hair.,1,11,B01LSUQSB0
"Returned it , it did not work for me. Made my hair even more frizzy and I had to go over it with the flat iron anyway which is what I was trying to avoid. My co- worker has it and it worked great for her which made me buy it. Maybe it depends on your hair type.",1,17,B01LSUQSB0
"Wow-started out great. Loved it! But then I noticed a lot of hair in the brush, then I noticed my hair thinning. Then after my last use, I noticed this. (See pic). Buyer beware!! If you use this, keep on low setting or you’ll be bald!! No dryer should get this hot!!!!",1,6,B01LSUQSB0
"Had high hopes for this but it’s a complete flop and failure. It doesn’t dry my hair well at all. I still have to use a regular blow dryer before I use this thing. Defeats the purpose since my blow dryer can do it all and perform better on drying and creating volume. Total waste of money and I feel cheated. Maybe I had a bad or defective one. Whatever the case, it’s now just sitting in my junk drawer and I’ve had to go back to my good old blow dryer. It’s not cheap either. I feel so gypped. What a waste of hard earned money.",1,11,B01LSUQSB0
"I have tried many dryers with brush attachments and this is by far the best one that I've ever tried. I read this in another review and was a little skeptical. This one is different for a few reasons. When I first received this I was concerned that it was too big and a little heavy, but it's not bad. It's not lightweight, but it's not terribly heavy. The base is rather wide and I don't have big hands, so holding it for a long time would get uncomfortable.
This brush dryer gets very hot, so I would definitely suggest using a heat protector. It does have a high and low setting, but low never seems to do it for me. The shape of the brush is different too. It's kind of like a flattened oval. Like another reviewer had said, the flat part of it really lets you smooth the hair while drying and styling it. The bristles are very good for gripping the hair. I have fine hair a little past my shoulders in long layers. Because the brush is so big, it really lets you get a lot of volume in your hair and it makes the layers look really good. I'm a little fanatical about my hair and this really helps you to get a perfect style. I'd suggest getting a great haircut and getting this styler. I can't do a round brush and blow dryer. I find it exhausting and I can never get the result that I want. With this thing I can. I use this between shampoos to smooth and style my hair in just a few minutes. I wouldn't suggest this for short hair. I think if your hair is chin length or longer that would be who this is perfect for. When you use this on wet hair, I'd wait until your hair is just damp and then you can section your hair and use this to dry it, or I've done it without sectioning and it comes out just as good. I wouldn't use this on very wet hair. It has decent power and again it gets very hot (almost too hot) but it would take too much time on very wet hair. Try it. I don't think you'll be disappointed.",5,23,B01LSUQSB0
"I bought this in Oct and LOVED IT! It dries and styles my hair in about 10 mins and recommended this product to many people. I woke Up to use it today, only about 7 weeks after purchasing and it worked fine at first but then started slowing down and eventually stopped all together and started SMOKING and smelling like fire! I had to put it outside. Use caution when using this product!!",1,7,B01LSUQSB0
"Thought this was a dream come true, worked perfectly the first time, was easy to use and dried my hair perfectly, and I had legit “salon hair”. Went to use it a second time and it would not turn on but instead the handle got insanely hot and started smoking. Do not waste your money or your hair...",1,10,B01LSUQSB0
"It makes your hair look super nice, but i guess it’s not built for thick hair because the first time I used it, the teeth changed their direction and it became all messy. Kind of disappointing how it didn’t even made it through one use.",2,8,B01LSUQSB0
"I waited for this to show up for two weeks. I checked the status of the package daily. I read countless reviews and watched multiple videos on this before buying. I’ve never been more excited for a box to show up on my door step. So.
Imagine my frustration when I didn’t even finish my whole head of hair when it started clanging, popping and smoking. I thought it was going to blow up in my hands.
My hope was that I got a faulty item in an otherwise wonderful batch of products.
Revlon, if you see this, I’d really love a refund. I’m willing to try it again, as the few strands of hair I got to dry looked beautiful.
But to waste 55 dollars on something that may or may not blow up? Isn’t cool.",1,6,B01LSUQSB0
"I honestly dont know how I didnt buy this product sooner. This is the best invention ever hands down. I now use this every day. Haven’t used my blow dryer in 2 weeks and rarely use my straightener anymore. My hair goes from sopping wet to salon blow out in 15 minutes flat. I section my hair in 3 parts and it could not be easier. I was also surprised that the brush doesn’t catch or pull your hair at all which is a miracle because mine is normally full of knots when it is wet.

Some have said the brush is heavy. I don’t find it heavy or cumbersome to use for 15 minutes. I use all three settings high heat, low heat and cool. The high heat dries my hair super fast and then once its dry I use the low heat to get it straighter and put a curl at the end.

Some people have said it gets too hot. I have not experienced this. I do however turn mine on and off between hair sections when I put it down on my bathroom counter to reposition the section I’m working on. The part where you hold onto the brush at the end does get warm, but not hot to the point of burning yourself.

Another thing I’ve noticed is my hair is 100% softer and more hydrated from using just this blowdry brush instead of using a blow dryer and a straightener. My hair feels like silk after I use it and I definitely rip less hair out and have less split ends than normal.

This product is a 10/10 and I absolutely love it. I just hope it is durable and lasts for 5+ years.",5,8,B01LSUQSB0
"I’m really happy I bought this for myself!
I have medium/thin blonde hair and it gets dry and brittle so I try not to wash and blow dry as often as other people.

This hair brush blow dryer works great for me and my hair type. The first time I tried it I was able to finish my hair in about 7 minutes which is so impressive. I didn’t even have to section off my hair! No more hair brush, clip and blow dryer. It’s just all in one with this thing.

At first it took a little bit to try and figure out how to hold it to get my hair shaped the way I want but after I figured it out I noticed that my hair took much better shape than it ever did with a hair brush. My hair really held on to the bristles and stayed there while it was drying. My hair turned out really soft and had more fluff to it which makes it easier to move around and flip over.

It does get hot and you do have to hold it close to your neck at time but I just turned the heat down. They have high, low and cool. Even on the cool setting (after you’ve had it on high) the inner core is still warm so it still drys your hair and shapes it really wonderfully.

If your thinking about getting- just get it!! I’m really so happy I did!",5,5,B01LSUQSB0
"I have resisted buying these because I have incredibly thick - but somehow still fine - hair. It gets so tangled in even round brushes. Worse, it's ringlet curly underneath and frizzy straight on top, so I either have to work to get it all curly or work to get it all straight. And volume is NOT something I need - I have Rosanna-rosanna-danna hair. But another reviewer with hair like mine said it worked for them, so I thought I'd try it. WHY DID I WAIT? This is *amazing.* It's like a salon blowout for me. Lasts for days. Works way better than a round brush, and the way the bristles are arranged, the shape of it, and the huge size of the barrel make it the perfect combination for my hair. My only complaint is the loudness of it, but I'm not sure how that could be fixed. I have been using it more on low anyway, which frankly works better than high in terms of how my hair looks when done. Try it!",5,5,B01LSUQSB0
"This thing is AMAZING. I have absolutely no hair styling skill and way less patience. I watched a ton of videos before I bought this and still thought it would bomb, but I was hopeful.. My hair is a chin-length “Bob” cut, and even when this thing arrived, I was afraid it was too big to effectively work with hair that short. It is incredible!! My hair is fine, but there’s a lot of it nonetheless, and it normally takes forever to dry - about 15 minutes working steadily, and it’s still damp under the surface. This tool has my hair sleek, smooth, and full of body in about 5 minutes! It looks like I just paid a pro to do it. I could easily throw my flat iron (which I had no patience with anyway) in the trash. I constantly get compliments, and I’m 60+ years-old, that’s not normal lol. I’ve had it for about 2 months now and see no evidence of damage to my hair, but I’m very careful to use a thermal protection gel. The hot setting is super-hot, but the next step down gets the job done. I just towel-dry my hair well first. If I’m in a huge rush, I run a blow dryer over it for about a minute before I start, but it’s not necessary. My only negative is the spot on the end where you sometimes support it with your non-dominant hand, could use a gripper surface, but I manage.",5,5,B01LSUQSB0
"I literally cannot say how much I love this Dryer...Amazon doesn't give me enough space to write my review! ;-)

I have fine, blonde hair that I struggled with--every day!--to polish and smooth the flyaways, to maintain a style that wasn't disheveled or fried-looking because I had to super heat it with my flat iron, which always left the ends looking boxy and frayed. I've used round brushes, smoothing products, special brushes, moisturizing products, creams, oils, balms, serums, etc. I thought my hair was destined to look like a fluff-ball unless I had a personal stylist doing my hair (because they ALWAYS had it looking polished and smooth and the style actually STAYED throughout the day). I had given up, until I found this little tool.

Literally night and day difference. I will try to post some pics soon. I have only had this since November, so I cannot say whether the summer humidity will destroy what this tool has helped create. I hope not!!

I actually get my hair--that tends to all go one direction--to frame my face. All. Day. Long.

The weight does take a little adjusting. I have to tuck my elbow in to account for it. You might take a few tries to get it right, but honestly - ten minutes of air-drying my hair and this tool will dry my entire head in less than 5 minutes. Wet to dry. I am getting one for my mom too.

If you have bangs: don't toss out your old hair dryer yet. I haven't figured a way for this to do a fringe bang, so I dry that first and then switch to this tool.

Also note: Day 2, if you wake up and your hair looks God-awful...just re-wet your head and style it again. Just like that, fresh style.

If you're on the fence, buy it!!

Last thing: your hair will get caught all over the bristles. Use a toothbrush or other small brush and it comes right out.",5,7,B01LSUQSB0
"I have straight hair that I wear in a bob cut that is at chin level. My old routine was a blow dryer and roll brush. This dryer has eliminated the need for the roll brush. It is a bit heavy so if your arms tire easily and you have thick hair—this may be the wrong dryer for you. I love it because my hair dries quickly and the end result is super straight and shiny. It is sturdy enough that I expect it would work well with thick curly hair as well. Highly recommend.

One word of caution: you CANNOT curl your hair with this dryer. Even a cute roll under the edges doesn’t work well—it just flattens the ends. The dryer area is too big and flat. There is not much of a rounded edge to curl your hair around. Consider this a super effective hair straightener.",5,3,B01LSUQSB0
"I was so excited to find this product, BUT that excitement went away quickly. When I used this product it burned my hair so badly that it set off our smoke alarm and the fire department was dispatched to our home. I have long, thick hair and thank goodness for that. The whole top of my head is now covered in frizzy, burned hairs. The dryer's brush barrel gets so hot it just melts the hair. It stayed hot for such a long time that after I had it turned off for 5 minutes I still burned my fingers from touching it. Do not use this product, it is dangerous. Don't let your children near this product, they could be seriously injured. I am surprised Amazon would sell something this dangerous.",1,8,B01LSUQSB0
"Wow wow wow! I have an always have had long thick curly/wavy unruly frizzy ringlet type hair that also decides in some places that it just wants to be wavy. I have spent years trying to live with my curly hair my straight hair my way be here whatever… Spending so much time in front of the mirror with both of my arms up over my head it’s taking a toll on my shoulders and my neck and my back. This is a game changer for me. I know there are more expensive ones out there but after reading the reviews and watching things on YouTube I decided to give this one a shot. holy cow! I am so glad I did. Like I seriously have the worst pain after I do my hair especially when I’m trying to straighten it because I have neck and arm issues- chronic stuff…
This has cut my time in half and it’s much later and I’m only using one arm to hold everything and occasionally using my other hand to kind of manipulate and separate hair pieces but it’s nothing like using a brush and a dryer. And it really really does dry my hair I am beyond shocked. Now my hair is long thick and curly so it probably took longer than a lot of the other reviewer’s… But compared to the time it takes for the dryer and a brush it’s much better. And I have a nice hair dryer it’s a baby bliss… And it does a good job… But this thing is fantastic.

I do Use either a flat iron or a straightening brush <see TYMO BRUSH!!> After I use this to completely straight in my hair 100% and I get 2 to 3 good hair days out of it. In the morning on day two and three I spray my dry shampoo in my hair and then I brush through it with a regular brush real quick then I use this brush for a minute or two all over and it’s like my hair is 100% refreshed.
I do agree that it’s a pain in the ass to clean just like any other brush you have to get a pic or something and pull through and get the hair out you don’t want the hair to build up that’s for sure. So even if you’re not OCD about your brushes you need to be OCD about this one. And it is so worth being that way",5,4,B01LSUQSB0
Amazon should not ship this out of the country. It is 110v and other countrys are 210 - 220V. It cannot be used with a converter either. It blew up the first time I switched it on. I cannot return it as I am in South Africa. There should be a warning about this on the product!!! A very big waste of a lot of money for me.,1,14,B01LSUQSB0
"My hair is baby fine and thin, and most hairdryers cause me to get nasty split ends and breakage. I bought this on a whim, and the difference between this and my high end dryer has been phenomenal! I have more volume in less time than it takes my usual routine. Plus, I've had much less breakage as well.

To style, I use a volumizer and heat protector, then flip my hair over and blowdry upside down. When I'm finished and flip my head back over, vavoom! Big hair!",5,14,B01LSUQSB0
"I got this product per recommendation of a friend. When I first used the hair dryer I wasn’t very impressed (my friend really built it up and she loved it) as I’m not used to the blow dry look and I am not used to using the brush/hair dryer separately, I’m more of an air dry girl. However I decided to give it another few chances as I felt it was more me getting used to it / not being great at using it rather than blaming hair dryer. I used it again in various ways, for a quick on the go look, for a thorough dry prior to straightening and another one to just see how it looks without straightening and throughout the day. I am very pleased with how it turned out. I’m thinking it was just a matter of me getting used to the tool. My hair ended up being soft, shiny, and the best part was the volume around the front of my scalp as this gets the flattest the quickest.

For reference I have somewhat thick hair that’s is colored. It tends to be on the drier side but gets oily within a couple days. I also have a keratin treatment in, and use Moroccan oil and a heat protectant spray.

I would highly recommend trying this out whether you’re an air dry girl like me or used to the brush/blow dryer method!",5,139,B01LSUQSB0
"Ok first off, I like the idea of being able to brush and dry my hair all at once creating a nice blowout look! I am really careful using heat tools on my hair because its fine and tends to damage easy. That being said this product gets way too hot for my fragile hair! The low is not hot enough and the high is like Satans kitchen hot! I wish there were a way to specify the temperature for this product. I would love it so much more if only it had that! It let my hair frizzy and not cute at all! After reading so many influensters raving about it, I am disappointed to say the least! IF you have stronger strands or your hair doesn't have a tendency to frizz easy, this product may work for you!",3,4,B01LSUQSB0
"Could not be easier. Distraught that I didn’t buy this before. Amazing amazing amazingggg hair tool, would recommend for everybody. I have waist length wavy hair (fine and medium thickness) and can get my blowout done in 20 mins or less.

I shower, put in my “it’s a 10” leave in conditioner with keratin, and then wait at least 1 hour for my hair to be damp/almost dry. I then go in and divide my hair into 3 rough sections from bottom to top. My Blowout lasts 4 days+ with dry shampoo in between. For reference I live in the subtropics in what feels like 158% humidity all year long. I never use hairspray but if you did I’m sure you could make it last even longer.

Touch ups are a breeze. The device does not get overly hot, it’s the prefect temperature. The only thing that’s missing is a cool shot button but my blowout lasts for so long anyway I’m more sure it would make a huge difference. I have not gotten any excessive bristle shedding. If you have bangs I can imagine that this would be a life saver. Going to get one for my mother in law for Christmas for sure. 10/10 would recommend leaves hair silky smooth and not frizzy at all.

Random side note.... my BF is fascinated by this drier 😂 he likes comes in every once in a while while in drying my hair and just watch, bless him.",5,3,B01LSUQSB0
"I really like this. I do have medium hair. It's not fine or thick, it's right in-between. It lost a star for me because it's so heavy and awkward after using it for awhile. I had to take a couple breaks and shake out my wrists. I usually flip my head over and blow dry it with a comb/brush, then I straighten it to reduce the frizz. I also noticed that you have to separate your hair into small sections because it's harder to get the hair dry. It doesn't give a salon blowout look like I thought it would. It's about the same result as I usually get with my normal routine. It doesn't really save me a ton of time because I flip my head over. However, if I did that on a regular basis, it would save me time. Also I did notice if you don't use the cool setting your hair will frizz. The cool setting really smooths out that frizz. If you have thick coarse hair this may NOT be for you. I think this would be great for any other hair type. I also think this would be great for someone with curly hair. The bristles really smooth out the hair. I will continue using this. I am very happy with this purchase. I just wish it was lighter and not so big.",,5,B01LSUQSB0
"When I travel, I typically hit up a dry bar to avoid having to worry about my hair for a few days. But, that gets pricy. I read a LOT of reviews on this and other hair dryer brushes before purchasing. I figured I'd take a chance and give it a shot.

I have medium-long color treated naturally wavy hair.

What I like:

- It dries quickly
- It's portable
- Hair does not get stuck in brush
- It gives a glossy feel when dried (even with no product)
- It does gives some volume
- It takes my wavy hair and makes it straight
- It is much easier than using a round brush + blow dryer

What I don't like:

- The on/off buttons are teeny tiny
- In the instruction book, it tells you to not wrap the cord around the handle post use (even when cooled down) as to not kink the wire. This makes storage slightly messy, as I have to store it with the cord unraveled.
- It is slightly top heavy. This is a ""duh"" because it is a round brush with a handle but your arm sometimes gets tired of holding it up due to the unbalanced weight of the brush.
- It gets super hot, which is great for drying - but you have to be aware of this when drying your hair. Don't hold it too long in one place.
- It states it cannot be used with adapters in other countries. This sort of defeats the purpose of travel internationally.

Overall I really like this and will continue to use it, but I'll need to find another version of the product to use when traveling abroad (or just hit up the dry bar).",4,5,B01LSUQSB0
"Okay this may be lengthy but only because I am in love with this tool! You’ve been warned!

So, my hair is thick - I have a lot of it and it is of a thick texture. Naturally I have a ton of volume which is why I go for a layered haircut. And with layered hair styles the best method of styling is via blowout. I’ve done the whole hair dryer and round brush method like the stylists do and it’s fine but it’s just not efficient to do every time I’ve washed my hair (and that’s not everyday). So most days I’ll let my hair be it’s normal (not straight) self like you see in the before picture.

To the rescue comes this hairdryer! I have seen ads on Facebook for this product and was always weary to buy from not so familiar sites. I hoped Amazon would carry a well known brand someday, and they finally have with this by Revlon. I actually owned a similar but older tool from Revlon which was supposed to achieve the same outcome. But the barrel was round and skinny, which was probably a design flaw and why they came up with this godsend.

I gave this baby a go last night. I used the low setting and my hair was very wet - just out of the shower. Obviously with the low setting and my hair being very wet it wouldn’t work as quickly or as effectively. I take it also my hair texture and thickness attributed to this. But still, not bad for the first try. Took about 20 mins which compared to blow drying and then flat ironing was still quicker.

I tried it again earlier tonight after washing my hair. This time, I let my hair air dry about 15-20 mins or so whilst I did other things around the house. Decided to try it and this time on the high setting. Voila! Hair done in less than 10 mins, with blow out quality and everything! Amazing!

The other thing that’s great is I can always do a quick touch up for the next day - just spray some water on my hair to slightly dampen and style. GOODBYE FLAT IRON AND BLOW DRYER, it was nice knowing you!",5,4,B01LSUQSB0
"I have hair that is very difficult to manage. It is coarse, semi-curly, and frizzy. I use salon-quality products to tame it (Bumble & Bumble and Moroccan Oil) and they do a good job, but my hair is still difficult to manage and frizzy. When I came across this brush I had hopes that it would be a solution to my problem: one less step in the hair taming process. Alas. it does help dry my hair and straighten it in the process, but it does not tame the frizz. If I want my hair frizz-free I still have to run a straightener through it. It does help me a lot since I am not very good with the hairdryer/round barrel brush process (I feel like I need several more arms to master this skill). Other than lack of frizz control the only other issue I have with this dryer is the noise it makes. I read the reviews about the noise but thought ""how bad could it be?"" Well, when it is basically IN YOUR EAR it is pretty bad. To the point where you could be worried about hearing damage if you are that kind of person.

Overall, it's okay, not a total waste of money. If you have more normal hair it is probably an awesome product. Unfortunately for me it is not my Holy Grail.",4,7,B01LSUQSB0
"I seen this item and others very similar to this plasted all over social media and even on YouTube videos so I decided to buy into the hype. Let me tell you it's not all that. That's high heat setting is very hot so I stick with the low which is does the job for me since I have fine hair but lots of it.The cool shot setting is only going to blow out warm air if you just finished using the warmer settings so to me it's pointless for that purpose but I use it during the drying process because I don't want too much heat. As far as frizz goes yep, my hair is still frizzy and I still have to pass the flat iron to smooth it out so why not just use a regular blow dryer? Maybe it's better for thicker coarse hair.",3,6,B01LSUQSB0
"It is bulky, huge, heavy and hard to work with. I'm a big woman and can barely hold it in my hand because even the slim part of the handle is too thick. I wanted to return it but due to travel, missed the return deadline. It has only low and high. You need to dry a small amount of hair at a time and work slowly for it to dry. My hair is longer than my shoulders and this is not practical. Very time-consuming.",1,7,B01LSUQSB0
"Awesome product. Would rate 5 stars if the motor didn’t die on my first one within 4 months of use (max 1 time per week). I contacted amazon for replacement but they would not replace bc I threw the product in the garbage while on vacation. I understand now why theyd want the product back, but have never purchased a product that only worked for a few months before and wasn’t familiar with the replacement policy of needing the damaged item. I liked the product well enough to purchass again. Hope revlon figured out the motor issue.",3,9,B01LSUQSB0
"Okay, so, I’ve never actually left a full review for a product I got on amazon before but I felt this handy lil guy deserved it. This thing really is great, the reviews don’t lie. I have very long, very thick & very curly hair. I’ve always had issues straightening it since I was a teenager & I could never get the hang of a regular blow dryer. My hair normally takes me about 45min-1hr to straighten with just a flatiron and let me tell you it is GRUELING...but I decided to give this thing a try AND WOW. 25mins to do my hair from start to finish. Now, I do have to say I had to go back and do touch ups, mainly the pieces close to my scalp, with a flat iron but compared to the effort and work I previously put into straightening it I didn’t even care. If you have hair like mine & are unsure, hopefully this review helps you decide!",5,10,B01LSUQSB0
"I wanted to love this and at first I did. I have wavy/curly hair that is thin but takes quite a long time to dry.

I have tried using it on wet hair to dry and also using it on varying degrees of drying to style. Either way I can never get a real straightening especially around my roots.

I also find my hair to feel super dull and brittle after using it. I have a lot of heat damage from it and the lower setting wouldn’t dry my hair. Sorry but it’s a no from me.

I did find it does a good job with volume and it does dry and give a bouncy dry that’s lovely if I could only get it straight.",2,3,B01LSUQSB0
I bought this because I was looking for an alternative to having to use both a dryer and a round brush to straighten my hair. I also liked the shape as I thought it would work better. The hair dryer works well enough to dry and straighten my naturally curling long hair however I have to wear a heat protective glove on my non-dominant hand or else it is too hot to grab my hair. Also it is not lightweight at all. I prefer my John Frieda round brush hot air dryer but I will keep this as I have 2 teenage daughters and need a back up :) But definitely use a glove!,3,8,B01LSUQSB0
"I have several girlfriends who RAVED about this item on Facebook. Visions of shorter drying time, quicker morning routines (on time for work! imagine!) and smooth blowouts danced in my head and I couldn't hit ""order"" fast enough. But as with most things, the reality is less exciting.

Yes, this think will dry your hair, smooth it out, and give you a bit of a bend at the bottom. That is, it will if you're great at sectioning your hair so you can get the brush under it and close to your scalp and if you have big strong hands. I suck at the former, and my small lady hand starts cramping by the time I finish with this. The brush is HEAVY and the barrel is HUGE, so by the time I'm half-finished with my hair my hand is hurting. It's cramping by the end. I've found my best routine with this item is to flip my hair over and 3/4 dry my hair with my blow dryer, then put in some volumizer and finish off with the Air Brush. It's a fine product, but not the one-and-done hair tool I was hoping it was.",4,2,B01LSUQSB0
"I have collar bone length, curly, coarse, thick hair with a traditional blow dryer and straightener it takes me about 1hr 15min to dry
And straighten my hair. With this it takes me 40 minutes! About 30 min of blow drying sections and a quick 10 mins with straightner to get the few “stubborn” spots. This is a game changer for when I want straight hair! Airflow is great and heat settings great (I have to use high and be careful when I get close to ears because it’s hot!) it is loud - but I can deal with that because it packs a powerful punch in a small machine. The handle is also pretty fat and gets a little hard to hold sometimes, but again it was probably hard to make something much smaller with this much drying power so I’ll take it! Watch YouTube reviews on this vs the dyson if you’re still on the fence, then come buy it and try for yourself!",5,2,B01LSUQSB0
"Based on some of the reviews, I was all psyched to have perfect blowout hair from this thing. The results were decent but not mind blowing. I would like to give it a 3.5 really. First a few caveats: I have a lot of very wavy/curly hair.

Pros:
-It did get my hair dry in a reasonable amount of time
-It's a nice fairly compact tool. I can see it being useful for traveling
-My wavy/curly hair is tame and straight after using this thing
-It dried without leaving frizz, which is pretty great. I never can just dry style. I always have to either curl or straighten afterward to eliminate the frizz and keep it from kinking back up. This seems to be holding nicely without frizz.

Neutrals:
-My hair is kind of flatter than I thought it would be. I get more height with the old-fashioned dryer and round brush. But I don't dislike it. It looks nice. Just thinner and flatter than my hair usually looks after I dry and style. And isn't getting frizzy or kinking back up without a second style (Curler or straightener) which I usually need
-It took the same amount of time as my usual dryer routine

Cons:
- On low, it does nothing. On high it was so hot that I kept burning my hands just touching my hair to start the section again.
- It started to feel heavy which is odd because I think my dryer is heavier... Maybe just the different motion?
- It's hard to know you're getting the roots good. My curly ladies out there know if you don't get the roots good, they will kink up immediately and wreak havoc on your style so it's imperative. I found it more challenging with this than my usual dryer
- They have a million warnings about not kinking or wrapping the cord. How am I supposed to store this sucker? I'm a very tidy person. I don't want cords up in my life.

Overall this product is decent but not a total replacement for my good ol' Rusk Speed Freak and broken round brush (Maybe I should get a new one of those).",4,5,B01LSUQSB0
"I hate to dry my hair. I rarely wash my hair because of it. It’s a time consuming difficult chore and while it still is, using one hand makes it 50% better. This is one of the best things I bought for myself this year. I will never go back to a regular old fashioned hair dryer again. I just bought five more of them to give as gifts. Buy this for yourself now!",5,7,B01LSUQSB0
Heating element went out and it’s not even 4 mos old. Contacted company w/ no answer back and it’s too late to return so I’m out the money.,1,8,B01LSUQSB0
"I have fine limp hair. This brush hair dryer dries quickly. My hair is dry within 5 minutes. It does get hot so make sure to put heat protector spray on your hair. It works WONDERS! I look like I just came out of a salon. Seriously! My hair is full, shiny, and gorgeous. Even during Zoom meetings at work, my co-workers comment on my hair. The only drawback is that I do have fine hair and I'm now 50 so I worry about hair loss. It would be a better product for me had the bristles been farther apart so it wouldn't pull so much hair out. I do cringe seeing the the hair in the brush.",5,3,B01LSUQSB0
"This thing is huge, but because of that it dries and styles my hair in half the time. I have long thick straight hair with long layers. Without any styling my hair looks dry and frizzy. With this brush my hair is soft and smooth with a gentle curl at the ends, which looks good on layered hair. It will not smooth as nicely as a flat iron though! My only complaints are that it gets too hot on high and cool setting is not cold enough. High and cool settings have full speed. The low setting is plenty hot enough but on a lower speed. I would only use high if my hair was wet, or else you will damage your hair! Low was enough for me to style my hair while dry. The cool setting was somewhat warm to me, and not at all like a ""cold blast"" setting you have on real hair dryers. The boar bristles grab my hair while I style and the longer thicker plastic bristles make it easy to brush through my hair. 3 boar bristles fell out the first time I used this. We shall see how long this brush holds up. So far I love it!

***Update after a week of owning this****
I've used this about 4-5 times, because I don't use it every day. It worked great when it did, but it broke on me today while using the Cool setting. When I was using it, I was using the Low setting for about 3-4 minutes to style and then switched to Cool, because I don't like to use a lot of heat on my hair. I heard a loud snap from the tool and then the motor started making an ultra high pitch sound as if the motor/fan was running super fast. It did not sound normal at all. I quickly unplugged it, and now am afraid to use it. I used this hot air brush properly according to instructions, only used it on a GFI outlet, and never even styled my hair on High with it because of all the reviews about this product over heating. I only turned it on High once ever and only for a few seconds just to see the heat and speed on that setting. I loved this while it worked! I honestly thought all the bad reviews were from people letting it get too hot. I was using Cool when it broke, so maybe the issue is when the motor speed runs on high since only the Low heat setting runs on low speed and high speed runs on both High and Cool temp settings? I have no idea. I do not recommend this product because it should not have broke after only 4-5 uses.",1,3,B01LSUQSB0
"Guys wow. My boyfriend but this product for me (yes im reviewing from his account). I usually dont review products but I think this is well deserved. I loved it, its so easy to use!!!!!

I entered an ""taking care of my natural hair phase"" because honestly even though I dont go much to the hair salon, I never really learned how to take care of my hair. I have 3B/3C hair according to my friends. It breaks easily and its extremely dry, and since the pandemic started ive decided to treat my hair nicely.

A month ago i decided i wanted to straighten my hair but was reluctant to go to a salon. I feel like the heat damage is minimum, first i used it on low then on high. My hair looked very shiny and nice. My mom loved it and of course my boyfriend did too.

I burned my fingers because i am extremely clumsy and the brush part gets hot! Sadly my country is very humid and as soon as I was done my hair started to frizz, also because of my lack of experience i noticed some minimal breakage on the top. But my hair literally breaks even if i breathe close to it so its fine.

If you have second thoughts to buy this brush, honestly just go for it, you wont know until you try. I literally watched like 5 videos before i gave it the try and i honestly thought it was going to leave me extremely disappointed. I love my curly hair and i also love how it looks when its straight. If you want to go for a really sleek look honestly you probably wont get it with this product. But the results you do get, wont disappoint...

Also literally take your time, my arms where extremely tired after i was done. But yeah sit down and chill and vibe and enjoy!",4,2,B01LSUQSB0
"During this Quarantine period, I have been experimenting with different ways to do my hair/makeup. I happened to catch an Instagram Live of Chris McMillan, who is Jennifer Aniston's hairstylist. He recommended this product and said Aniston has been using it during this social distancing period. Well, that was all the recommendation I needed to give the Revlon One-Step Hair Dryer a try! The results are positive.

The Pros: I love how my hair feels and looks. I am constantly touching my hair because it feels just like it does when I get a professional blow out. My hair is very smooth and shiny after using this tool. I don't know when I will be able to see my stylist again, so this tool is a true blessing for making me feel ""put together"" at home.

The Cons: I wish there was a medium setting. I was literally sweating after using the high setting on the first use! To combat this, I now use the high setting for the bottom layer of my hair and switch to low for the upper most and face framing layers. Also, I did not save any significant time using this tool as opposed to my blowdryer and round brush. It took me about 25 minutes with Revlon. My Babyliss blowdryer usually takes 30 minutes. I also wonder about the longevity of the product based on some of the reviews I have read.

The Verdict: This is the best blow out I have ever given to my own hair! The results are professional looking. I highly recommend. Fingers crossed for great longevity!",5,3,B01LSUQSB0
"I am normally a fan of a traditional hair dryer/round brush blowout; with practice you really can get salon level results at home. Unfortunately due to injury, I won't be able to hold my usual tools for a few months. I bought this on the recommendation of a friend, thinking I would only use it short term, but this is a really impressive tool. It is exceptionally fast - my hair is thick, medium length, and was about 90% air dry, and it took less than 5 minutes to style! Traditional styling usually takes me at least 20 minutes. It may not give you the same bounce and results as a blowout, but man my hair is SUPER shiny and smooth.

It is not a featherlight product, but I would disagree with the weight critiques. It definitely weighs less than the average hair dryer and only requires one hand. Plus it's so quick, you won't be holding it up too long. I wish the cool setting were more of a pressable button, as it's location at the base doesn't lend to one hand operation. It also does get extremely hot, so a hair protectant is a must. But I already promised my mom could have it when I was able to use my old tools, so looks like I will be buying her another one, because I am keeping this for quick results and travel!",5,4,B01LSUQSB0
"I first tried a hot air rotating brush from another brand but my hair remained frizzy. After my friend showed up one day with the shiniest hair I've ever seen her sport, all thanks to the Revlon One-Step Hair Dryer & Volumizer Hot Air Brush, I thought I had to give this brush a try. Now for me, it didn't quite have that effect. It did a pretty good job of giving a bouncy blowout, but my hair lacked the shine I usually get from a professional blowout, and I still had frizz. I was hoping that I wouldn't have to then further damage my hair with a flatiron, but if I really want to get that smooth look, I have no choice. I also find that I usually need to go over the blowout every day. I think this tool is likely mind-blowing for those that don't have problem frizzy hair like mine. However, for those that do, this tool might not be the all-in-one solution they were hoping for. I will say that it only takes about 15-20 minutes to totally dry my hair. What I did like: 1) It's a large brush that can hold a lot of hair. It has great drying power, even if you're starting off with wet hair (which most don't recommend to start with). 2) The brush grips the hair well, but at the same time provides some slip. My hair does not at all get caught in the bristles, nor in the vents. 3) It's very easy to get the hang of. I'm pretty uncoordinated and clumsy but it was still easy to figure out. A couple of things that I didn't like: 1) The cord is too short. I wish it was 1 foot longer 2) Inadequate temperature settings. The high is really high. You can smell burning at times. The low is too low. The cool setting isn't actually cool. It's more like lukewarm.
So all in all, for home use, I definitely like this brush better than a blowdrier and brush (which leaves my hair looking disastrous) but it’s not quite the perfect solution for frizzy hair. My hair will never look the way it does from a salon blowout using just this brush unfortunately.",4,2,B01LSUQSB0
"After seeing the advertisement for a similar, higher-priced product, Amazon search results brought me to this Revlon dry and style all-in-one for a quarter of what the higher-priced product cost; this is a steal in comparison to the competitor.

The Delivery

The product showed up at my door in its original box and they slapped a mailing label on it. This gave me pause because since there was no protective packaging, I thought for sure the dryer would have been damaged in transit. Thankfully, the product was undamaged when I took it out of the box. On further inspection, it was not scratched or dinged up and it worked as soon as I plugged it in.

The Dryer

The product itself is quite large and larger than what I had expected. The oval shape of the brush head seemed concerning to me as I've only ever used a round brush with my NuMe Ionic Hair Dryer. The settings are cool, low, and high and are located on a dial at the bottom end of the dryer. To use the product was self-explanatory, all there is to do is plug it in, select the heat setting, and off you go to a great blow out.

The Experience

Before blowing out my hair, I use whatever hair product I have on hand at the time. Right now, I am using a coconut oil hair moisturizing serum which helps to temper flyaways, leaves the hair with a smoother finish, and moisturizes. For my hair length, a nickel-size amount is just enough for my just-past-the-shoulders hair length and then comb through. Then I section off my hair to make drying more manageable.

Starting with the back sections, I started with the low setting and brushed in a downward direction and letting the brush feature volumize on its own. The back sections are the most difficult for me because they are, for some strange reason, wavy, unruly, and difficult to keep straight. This brush dryer brought the back parts out and under for a nice bouncy finish. It was nearly a perfect 'C' formation that I couldn't believe. I then moved to the side sections and the crown and was surprised with the volume the brush gives. While I'm drying the side sections, I'm leaving hair rolled up in the brush and allowing it to remain there for a few seconds before I gently pull the brush through the length of my hair. Unbelievable. It was almost like having big Texas hair.

Finishing up with the rest of my hair, I noticed that the grip on the dryer is much more comfortable than my other hairdryer and round brush. The thickness of the pommel makes for a very comfortable grip, and I didn't realize what a difference size made. The other thing I noticed is at the upper end of the dryer, there is room to grab the end with your other hand and work the brush into a rolling motion (if you like to use two hands, which I do).

During the first use, I timed it as it normally takes me about 7 or 10 minutes to dry my hair. With the Revlon, it cut that time in half. My hair came out dry, volumized, shiny, sleek, and the finish was as though I had taken a straight iron to my hair before applying a curling iron. There was so much bounce to my hair that it felt like I just got a hair cut. When I pulled my hair into a pony at the end of the day, the pony was bouncy.

The Next Day

What I noticed when waking up the next day is that my hair was still bouncy and still sleek. With my normal hairdryer, I still had problems with frizz and my hair just did not keep through the rest of the day. Consequently, for second-day hair, I had to use a dry shampoo to give it a little life. With the Revlon, second-day hair felt just like it did the day before, which was nearly a shock. I called my girlfriend who had been looking at this product with me, and I told her that everything they said about it was true - and I didn't have to do my hair the second day because it kept through the night. Say what?!

The Predecessor

The old hairdryer and round brush went back into my mom's bottom drawer in her bathroom, for when she comes to visit. Although I have a sneaky suspicion that when she tries my Revlon, she's going to toss those in the can.

The Negative Reviews

Yes, I have read all the negative reviews about how this thing craps out after a few uses, or two months, whichever occurs first. I hope that it does not happen here, and if it does, I will update this review to let you know how long it took for it to die on me.

As for the other reviews about how the hair turns out following use . . . (1) don't leave the dryer in one place while you use, or it will burn your hair, doing anything with the application of heat has a tendency to burn if you leave it too long, that's just physics, (2) I did not have any hair loss while using this product, but I do comb out my wet hair first to work out any knots and tangles and comb through any product I am using before drying, and (3) if you do not have bounce or sleekness, um, go watch some YouTube videos and learn how to comb your hair.

Great product, unbelievable. Totally thought it was a gimmick, and pleasantly surprised at how well this works - and for the price - you can't go wrong!",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"Let me start out by saying I have fine-ish hair, but A LOT of it. It's somewhere between ringlet curls and straight, depending on the strand of hair. And I get the FRIZZIEST ringlet curls around my face. Needless to say, I can't simply let my hair air dry and be done. With a regular hair dryer, my hair just gets really poofy and frizzy, so I typically try to dry it straighter just to use another hot tool to smooth it out. My preferred style is straight, or mostly straight with a little body wave. And when I say straight, I mean I want a natural straight look, with a little bit of flip at the ends - not an obviously flat ironed look. THIS LOOK IS SO HARD FOR ME TO CREATE WITH REGULAR TOOLS. After blow drying, I typically use the amika straightening brush, that does achieve a somewhat more natural straight look, but the ends still end up looking too straight and dry, which makes the whole look not look great.

Enter the Revlon one step. THIS GIVES ME THE EXACT LOOK I WANT. It makes my hair look like it's naturally straight with A LOT of body. And the ends look perfectly smooth, which is difficult to achieve with my colored hair. Did I mention that I get this look in 15 minutes from wet hair to done? That's a huge deal because I hate doing my hair, especially in the summer. Basically I will continue to use this instead of my regular hair dryer until it stops working, and then I will buy I new one. I love it, and you will too. Don't hestitate, JUST BUY IT.",5,3,B01LSUQSB0

"I have a lot of hair. It’s always been thick but now as I’m getting older, it dries wavy and feels wiry. Hate my hair. Every time I go to a salon, the staff marvels at how thick my hair is!

I saw all the moms posting about this miracle Revlon blow dryer-brush and hesitated. Nothing works on my hair. But I gave it ago and I stand by my claim that’s nothing works on my hair.

It took the same amount of time to use Revlon’s One-Step Hair Dryer as it took to use my powerful mini blow dryer. I had less control with the Revlon one because you’re either flipping your hair up or flipping it under. I wanted straight hair. For that, I need a paddle brush, not a big round brush.

All the mom posting pics on Facebook seemed to have that same flip.

It takes so long to dry my hair that I was nervous the Revlon dryer would catch on fire. It gets so hot! It doesn’t seem safe. The brush part was soon full of my loose hair, making it hard for the brush to grip my hair as I styled it.

I just tossed my $59.99 purchase. It wasn’t for me.",1,4,B01LSUQSB0
"I heard all the reviews and bought this. I really thought it was a game changer for me and loved it as it cut down my drying time by 30 minutes. I bought this in October 2020, it's now end of January 2021 and it's pretty much a brick. All of the bristles have warped and bent and won't catch my hair anymore. It feels like its frying and damaging my hair. The air hardly blows through the whole brush as before. It's worthless now and going in the trash. Very upset especially since it was $45 I expected it to have lasted longer. If you really have to have a dryer brush, save your money and go to TJMaxx or Marshalls and get an off brand for half the cost. I'm sure it will be of similar ""quality"".",1,2,B01LSUQSB0
"I bought this after hearing about it a lot from my friends. The first time I used it, I thought, WOW! This made my hair SO straight and not frizzy. The only downside is the temperature control is NOT good. It gets SUPER hot so you have to move it around while blowdrying and be careful not to burn your scalp or hair. I have really thin hair, so I need to be careful. Also, it takes a long time compared to regular blowdrying. I think this takes at least 10 minutes when normal blowdrying would take like 5 minutes. It's because with this, you have to section out your hair, use it, section off more hair, and use it again throughout the whole head. Because of how time consuming it is, I started to stop using it as much. I still like it, but think it's a mediocre product. It's good for when I want to have nice hair on a night out, but not for everyday use; not super practical.",3,2,B01LSUQSB0
"Let's be real here: I have super thick, half wavy, half loose curl nightmare hair. When I let it air dry, I look like the Cowardly Lion, when I try to blow dry with a round brush I look like Chewbacca, and if I just blow dry alone, I look like the yield sign on your standard highway ramp. But with this hot brush, all my problems have been solved. I now have sweet, sweet hair like a movie star (think Olive Penderghast in Easy A). I used to spend on average 1.5 hours to blow dry then straighten my hair, and tonight with this baby, it took 15 minutes. 15 MINUTES! That's 1.25 HOURS of my life back every few days. For this, all I can do is sing Hallelujah! However, it's important to note nothing is perfect. After the first use, the tufted bristles are already coming out. Not a huge deal; they're tons in the brush, but still annoyed me. The ""Cool Tip?"" Nah, friends. I burnt the bejesus out of my finger tips touching that thing. And Heaven forbid your finger slips up and hits the metal barrel -- that will feel like a dose of Hell on your fingers. It's a bit cumbersome to hold and could be balanced much better for easy handling, but that might just be me needing to get used to it. Regardless, this baby is my new best friend. I've already recommended it to multiple people, and by golly I might just purchase more for holiday/birthday gifts. Highly recommend this product. Trust me, if you're on the fence, just get it. It's a worthy investment for time's sake.",4,One,B01LSUQSB0
"* EDIT
I originally did not like this product I felt it difficult to use and frustrating. What I have learned since is that your hair needs to be damp and not wet. If it’s wet it’s gonna take FOREVER and essentially steam your hair so it won’t be nice and straight. However, if you let your hair naturally dry somewhat and THEN use it, it works much better. I recommend using a frizz free serum when the hair is wet, letting it become damp, spray with heat protectant and do 1-2 inch sections. It’s not as fast as basic blow drying but it’s pretty close to round brushing

So normally I use a 10+ year old blow dryer and a lightweight round brush. But I saw this and thought “well maybe that will be easier” it is SOOOO hard to use! My arm aches! Blow drying and round brushing seems easier and never burns my ears. The effects aren’t as long last as round brushing either because I can’t get all of my hair dry",4,2,B01LSUQSB0
"WOW!! I was hoping this would help decrease the time it took to blow dry and style my hair, but I had no idea the Revlon One-Step Hair Dryer & Volumizer Hot Air Brush would cut it to 15min PLUS ...smooth, volume, soft touch, NOT frizzy. I usually use a blow dryer on med heat, then a large curling iron and still my hair was never this smooth and soft. When I finished, my boyfriend said, ""You're finished already?!, Wow your hair looks great!"". Then later he mentioned how soft my hair felt. Thank you, I no longer have to keep trying different products to see if it will help smooth out, plus provide volume for my hair. Well worth every penny. I read reviews for most everything I purchase (I did not receive anything for this review!).",5,4,B01LSUQSB0
"I have been looking forward to try this brush out for so long! So many rave reviews and I had to try it. I have an extremely long, thick, and wavy hair. I gave up blow drying and straightening (with a flat iron) ages ago and I'm only 31.

I showered before trying this out. I towel dried it. I turned the brush on - instant warmth and I could feel it drying on my hands. The brush handle is rather wide and thick - I got tired of holding it so I had to use my other hand to continue within the first ten minutes. I brushed one section of the hand for probably 5 minutes and it straightened - but it was still wet. Urgh! I tried it over and over again - same results. I gave up after three days and returned it.",1,3,B01LSUQSB0
"I was very skeptical about buying this. I have a whole hair routine that hasn’t changed since high school 😂 but at 30, I am tired of spending so much time on my feet doing my hair. I have very thick, long, wavy hair and normally I blow dry, then straighten it. The whole process usually takes me an hour and a half. All the reviews said this product saved them so much time so I thought I’d try it out and y’all, when I tell you this is a game changer.... I just used it for the 1st time yesterday and it only took me 30 mins, start to finish to do my hair! Once I get the hang of it, I’m sure it’ll be closer to 20 mins. I love this product!! I still used my straightener afterwards though, this product is not really going to get your hair straight if that’s what you’re going for. But it dried my hair so fast and then the straightening part only took like 10 mins. My hair looks and feels so amazing. It is pretty loud but that isn’t a dealbreaker for me. It’s worth it! I used mine on low too so it didn’t get too hot. I can’t wait to use it again!",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
I think I was wishing for more. Ok so back story I have wavy hair that will be frizzy with humidity or air drying. If I have a hair tie in my hair is crazy and will form to the shape of it. I normally don’t use heat unless my hair is fully dried and typically the day after washing. I usually brush my hair and put it up and it stays sleek and non frizzy even once dried. I was hoping this had enough heat to stop my hair being frizzy or poofy but it doesn’t get hot enough. It almost dried my hair after like 15 mins of use it was mostly dry but it made it very frizzy stringy slightly wavy and poofy I still had to use my flat iron to calm some of it down. So I will give it 3 stars if I had different hair it might work better for me but I will say this combined the two would work really nicely if I have to wash my hair and want to straighten it the same day so that’s a plus I guess. It’s fairly easy to use and easy to clean out the brush is really nice and the heat is like a medium heat not very hot at all on the high setting. I still need to try the cool setting.,3,One,B01LSUQSB0
"Basically all of the good reviews are accurate. Amazing and easy to use. My hair is curly/wavy and very thick, bleached and dyed and very long to my butt and in the first use I went from out of the shower barely towel dried to straight dry hair in about 20 minutes. I used one product, a spray with healthy oils and heat protection.

I was also able to use it on my kids’ and husband hair to dry. They have kinky to stick straight hair. It dried and styled their hair after showers.

It’s definitely not a flat iron but I’m so impressed and got mine on sale for $39.

I was going to buy the Dyson styler but decided on this first to see if this type of thing would even be worth trying. Needless to say I won’t be buying the $550+ splurge!

Due to covid I’ve been at home for months with my kids, most days I look like a mess. I realized I need something new, a change. I’m glad I got this. I’m a tomboy goth chick and I don’t spent a lot of time on my household look. I’m changing diapers and making lunches all day. But my husband deserve better. He doesn’t complain and he’s amazing but I’m here complaining for him. This is going to help me change my daily routine! Self improvement! Here’s to not being 2020!",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I apologise for the long review but it might help women with dense and thick hair, so read on. :)
I bought this a month ago and I use it once or twice a week. I was skeptical at first because I have very thich hair. Before this I used to iron my hair but since it took lot of time, I went for this.
I feel this is a waste of money for below reasons:
1. It takes around 25-30 minutes to completely dry and style my hair with this. (Flat iron used to take me 40 minutes) So no improvement here.
2. I can see lot of broken hair tangled in the bristles only after single use. Flat iron did not damage my hair as much as this dryer did (I always use heat protector (the loreal paris thermal smoother cream or spray) before usage.)
3. This makes lot of noise (even my vacuum cleaner makes less noise than this).

I read lot of reviews where women have said it only took them 10 minutes to get a salon style look. Maybe it's suitable for thinner hair or something. But it just doesn't work for me. I wish I could return this and get my money back but I can't do so.
I would prefer using a flat iron because I have compared the amount of hair that breaks after using flat iron and this dryer.
Attaching a photo of my hair for reference.",1,2,B01LSUQSB0
"So I’ve had this for about a year now and I absolutely love it. It works well with damp hair and also retouching hair after the next day. My hair is super thick and stubbornly wavy. My hair still waves about mid day after using this, but it takes me half the time to straighten it versus using a flat iron only. The only thing is I wish it had a feature where you can manipulate the temperature. On high, it’s super hot, then low is okay but not enough heat for my hair, and then cool is the same speed as “high,” it just blasts cool air. It would have been nice if it had a “warm” feature but at the same speed as “high.”",4,8,B01LSUQSB0
"I'm not entirely sure I'd choose my husband.

I love this brush. LOVE. Let me preface this review by saying- I have long, curly, and (until I bought this) unmanageable hair. I've never, NEVER been able to dry my own hair, much less straighten it. Holding a dryer and a hairbrush used to cause my arms to ache, it never got entirely dry, and I'd usually end up frustrated and just give up after 20-30 minutes of my best effort.

But this dryer changed all that. I admit, my hair was shorter when I first bought it (growing out a pixie, bought this dryer at the point where the curling iron wasn't cutting it anymore). I think that helped me learn the best way of utilizing it. But now I can't live without it. I can do my hair in 20 minutes. Really, I could cut it down to 15 if I didn't do any pre-drying techniques (towel drying, products, etc.) To have dry hair in 20 minutes, though---- LIFE CHANGER for me. Seriously. I can shower in the mornings now and still have good hair for an interview, instead of spending hours prepping the night before.

I recommend this dryer to everyone, even if your hair isn't as problematic as mine, it'll still get you out the door faster and your arms won't hurt from holding the dryer and a brush.

My only complaint- and I did debate taking off a star for this, but I didn't because this is a manageable complaint- is storage. It's a big brush, and there's no stand or wrap or anything for it. I piled it on top of my other dryers and curling irons in a bucket in the closet, but some of the bristles bent within a few days. So you need to find a big hook to hand this, or a way to stand it. Or just be aware that the bristles are delicate and be gentle with it. But it's worth the delicate dance for the results.",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"So I just want to say I'm a normal person, I didn't get this for free or a discount in order to leave a review, but I am someone who comes to amazon and THOUROUGHLY reads through the reviews of something before i buy it (even the negative ones) and make my decision, so I feel i'd be doing a disservice if I didn't write my own. Let me preface this by saying I have LONG, THICK, FRIZZY, DAMAGED, CURLY hair, like everyone else who deals with this kind of hair, I am sick of spending an hour blow drying, and straightening it every two days so I am always looking for the latest thing. This came up in my facebook feed and of course every person using it has perfect hair, so I turned to amazon and read the reviews, and purchased mine. I AM OBSESSED, so obsessed that i'm purchasing a second one for our vacation home in the summer so I don't have to drag it back and forth. It literally cuts my drying time in half, it's super easy to use, and for some reason cuts way down on the frizz. I still use a heat protectant/smoothing spray before use, but my hair comes out volumized, less frizzy and perfect. Did i mention it cuts the drying time IN HALF and I don't have to use my straightener after! The negative reviews i've seen all say that it stops working, so for a measly $6 extra i bought the extended warranty, so if that happens, I am covered! For now, i'm a believer and would reccommend this to EVERYONE. My daughter also uses it who has thick straight hair, and it takes her 15 min, she's 12!",5,5,B01LSUQSB0
"It's.... eh. At first, I thought the weight was no different than a hair dryer. The problem is, you're twisting and turning your wrist in ways you wouldn't holding a hair dryer. So, your wrist very quickly gets sore and it gets heavier. Plus, the handle is very big so it's hard to hold for any length of time.
The noise wasn't too bad, but I kept on on low so it could be worse the higher you go.
I didn't notice my hair looking any different, better or worse, than it normally does.
It's an okay product, not sure how long I'll use it.
Revlon, they make cameras that fit in the head of a pen, you can't make a lighter dryer??",3,6,B01LSUQSB0
"I read a lot of reviews before buying this that said it FRIED their hair and I was like - “dang, these girls are dramatic. How badly could it fry your hair if there are thousands and thousands of women who love this thing?!” Well. It does. I don’t know if it’s the supplier, or if there’s something wrong with the way they’re making them now or something...but something is definitely, DEFINITELY wrong with this product. Do not buy. Will fry. Sorry for judging you ladies! Should’ve listened!",1,4,B01LSUQSB0
"I have to admit I wasn't thinking about how short my hair is in the back when I purchased this, so most of my issues come from that. I just cut my hair into an inverted bob and I knew I could never pull off a round brush with a dryer because I am completely uncoordinated when it comes to hair styling. When I tried the Revlon, I didn't have great luck with it. It's too big for the short hair in the back. Also, I had clipped up my longer sections while trying to dry the back and the air from the dryer actually mostly dried the hair I didn't want to dry yet as I was planning on styling those sections afterward. Because I have very frizzy, wavy/loose curly hair, it ended up looking both flat and frizzy at the same time, and I had to rewet some sections to do over. Drying the roots with a hair dryer first also over dried the rest of my hair, making this tool completely pointless for me. It was a frustrating experience overall. I definitely need a smaller barrel for this work.

That said, if you have longer hair, this could probably be great! At $40, I think I will keep it and so how I fare when my hair grows out. Unless my daughter steals it first. Lol",3,One,B01LSUQSB0
I don’t think I have ever left a review on Amazon before but for this product right here I will! This is a game changer! I have a lot of hair. It’s thick and wavy/Curly. I would always just either go to the salon for a blow out (because my arms would get so tired doing it myself) or I would just let it air dry and then flat iron it. I was content with this. Until I saw a YouTube video with someone with my hair type using this. I saw her results and new I had to have it.... but being skeptical ... I gad to watch more lol..after going down the Revlon you tube rabbit hole and seeing only postive reviews I new I had to take the plunge....so I order it for my mom 😂😂 she’s the critic of all critics when it comes to hair tools. Well she absolutely LOVED it...so then I purchased it for myself lol. When I got it I was a bit alarmed with how big it was...but then I tried it. From the first section I did I was in awwww! It left it full of volume and life it looked so healthy and shinny and it felt so soft! I did my entire head in 20 minutes!! It looked even BETTER than when I would go to the salon! Even my 13 year old son noticed it. I get compliments on my hair every where I go now! I have long layers so the way it just falls on each other is STUNNING. I love this product so much that I got one for my sister in law and mother in law and my mother made me order her another one to keep on hand just Incase something happens to hers she has back up (I’m not even making this up) please guys if you love to have hair full of volume ...shine...and super soft GET THIS TOOL RIGHT NOW!,5,4,B01LSUQSB0
"If anyone wants an inventive way to torment your husband, please read this testimonial for this splendorific device.

I procured this doohicky because my bestie was raving about it, despite my aversion to such cosmetic sorcery. My hair dryer is from the 90s, you see, and the most new fangled contraption I use for beauty is a hair straightener.

But alas, she raved. So I said ""fine. I will try this absurdity in the instance is really does shave off THAT much time.""

Fast forward to my use of this joyful piece of frivolity.

My hair was done in a pinch! A snap. Holy Moly, she was right. And my hair was BANGIN!

I did have a slightly terrifying moment in the beginning, in which I was sure I was going to have to cut it out of my hair and land myself with a Karen cut, and be forced to change my name to Karen Caron. But as you can see, my luscious mermaid locks survived.

Anyhow, my poor husband.

ANY TIME WE ARE IN THE SAME ROOM-

""Babe - don't you love my hair?""

""Doesn't it look amazing?""

""Come on babe, tell me you LOVE my hair.""

And then tonight, just to add some zest into his subdued life of pandemic isolation, I Nina Rose, all hopped up on a sugar overdose of Strawberry cake with cream cheese frosting that my future mini chef made, started to hop around the house like a bunny, telling him to watch how my hair can BOUNCE!

Yes this is absurd.

Yes I am absurd.

Yes he wants to kill me and focus on refi paperwork.

But alas, I supposed all men should be tortured with the occasional bunny hop.

You're welcome, ladies.

And ummmm, look at my HAIR!",5,2,B01LSUQSB0
"I was so excited to try this brush- the first few times I liked it and felt that my hair dried well and looked good- not salon blowout quality but definitely made it smoother than normal. However, the temperature control on this appliance is quite sub-par. Therefore, it gets way too hot and the 4th or 5th time I used it, it burnt off whole sections of hair, and quite a bit of it. It will take forever to grow back. I was careful using this appliance, it's not rocket science- the low setting is too low to dry hair and the high will eventually get hot and burn your hair off. I have medium length, coarse hair. I wish I could return it!",1,4,B01LSUQSB0
"This is the best beauty tool I have bought in thirty years. I cannot believe it. The ease of getting my hair smooth and shiny and dry is astounding. I have naturally wavy fine hair, and it will frizz sometimes if it dries wrong. This is SO EASY to use and dries even the back of my head into smooth tresses. To those saying it burned their hair: learn how to use a blow dryer. Just like you can’t point a regular blow dryer at your hair wrapped around a brush and just leave it there to burn, you can’t wrap your hair around this brush and just leave it there. There is hot air coming out of this machine. Keep it moving. Be aware of how hot your hair is getting. It is the exact same way you have to be careful not to burn your hair when you’re using a regular blow dryer. Honestly, I cannot believe this beauty tool. It is the best thing since blow dryers came out in the first place.",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I give this 1 star overall, because of an issue i just recently had 3+ months after buying it. I use it maybe once every weekend and that’s it! I have had no issues or complaints, in fact, i adored it and recommended it to tons of people... UNTIL this weekend, I had it plugged into the wall, NOT TURNED ON at all, the dial was on “off”, even if it was on it was be running just like a hair dryer sounds. So it was off, but just connected to the outlet. I went downstairs, came up about 15 later to start my hair, and grabbed the handle to pick up and cut on and it was HOT. I have no idea how this happens when it was completely turned off and not on. Then it smells like it’s burning inside, i gear no noises, no sounds, and have no idea how this happened. So, i unplug immediately, and set it down to cool off, and pick up again and it’s even HOTTER to touch. I take it outside, in case god forbid, it caught on fire for whatever reason and it literally took probably 30 min before i felt it start to actually cool off. Very scary guys! Had I continued to tidy up downstairs and keep it just plugged in (and OFF!) who knows what would’ve happened. This is why I always notoriously, unplug things from the wall even if they’re “off”, you never know what electricity is going beyond what we can’t see. I love this tool, so I’m frustrated it happened, but I would NOT risk this brand! Not worth a house fire!",1,2,B01LSUQSB0
This would be a fantastic product if it was possible to adjust the temperature. There are only two settings - burning hot and cool. My hair is too fine to handle the hot temperature and the cool temp isn’t enough to smooth out the frizz.,3,8,B01LSUQSB0
"I have always been a somewhat uncoordinated blow dryer. Managing dryer and multiple brushes and products for volume tended to leave my blowouts a bit frizzy and...haphazard looking? I just used this one-step dryer for the very first time and have achieved (NOT KIDDING!) a salon quality blow out. It is sleek. It is shiny. It has volume without the frizz and fly-aways. I have never felt my hair this soft or polished when I style it myself. It is easy to use and fast. Maybe my favorite part is the combo bristles that grip and detangle so well! I have super fine hair which would blow all over with a conventional dryer, and this thing holds onto every strand of hair so that none of my energy is wasted. I am legitimately buying one for my mother right now. That is how much I love this product.",5,2,B01LSUQSB0
"Love!! Its amazing. Not only is it quicker than using a regular blow dryer and brush, the results are amazing. I finally am able to blow out those annoying little waves that I never could in the past. I have fine hair with a slight wave and with the Revlon One Step, my hair looks as if I blew it out then used a straightener. I absolutely love the results. The only downfall, and it is worth it because of the results, is the weight and width of the handle. Oh well, so you get a little arm workout.",5,4,B01LSUQSB0
"So first things first let’s start with what kind of hair I have. I have 3b-3c course curly thick hair. Pretty long almost my waist length and dries relatively fast. Saw so many reviews about this blower that I had to try. I’m convinced people are getting payed to review it and leave great reviews.

Pros: drying time took me 30 mins to completely dry from wet to dry. Straighten my hair fast and also was easy to maneuver. It’s big so you catch a lot of hair and it’s great to just dry your hair fast.

Cons: just with one use the bristles on the brush opened and flatten, making it so that with time the brush part of the blower will open your strands and cause massive breakage and massive split ends. In essence, making you repurchase another one pretty fast- if you use this all the time.

Another thing that I didn’t like was that my hair never felt silky. It had shine but no silk. It was so frizzy that I was just like wth. On top of that it broke a lot of my hair off. Keep in mind my hair is pretty thick and healthy. I’m not sure if anyone has gone to a salon gotten a blow dryer and when it’s done it looks fine but when you leave it immediately poofs up. This is what this blower did to my hair, looked fine at first- then maybe 20 mins POOF. No matter how much I passed it, it still wasn’t good.
To my curly headed thick strand and course hair girls- this isn’t for us if you want silk flowly hair. This is great to just stretch hair someone with a bit of more flow.

Would never purchase this again.

"Drying power was great, device handling was fine, the sound was ear piercing, temperature gets really hot.

I could actually feel and hear a difference with my hearing for roughly 30 - 40 minutes after drying. Ear plugs recommended.

I used my watch to give me its suggestions on the sound decibels. I’ve attached a photo where I was in the bathroom with no noise, and with the device on high, low, and cool. I used the device on high as I have thick, wavy, shoulder length hair with layers. It took approximately 10-15 minutes to dry. My ears felt a little damaged afterwards, as if they were plugged.

As for my hair, the dryer smoothed it very nicely and left it shiny. But, with no volume. I would recommend a heat protectant if someone were to use this multiple times per week.

I likely won’t use it again only because of the sound and I do prefer leaving my hair wavy as it’s much less drying time.",3,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I am so incredibly disappointed with this product! I received mine in the mail yesterday and was excited to use it for the first time! Unfortunately, after only using it for 10 minutes during the VERY FIRST USE, it seemed to have overheated and barely works now. It seems to only want to work on the low setting now, which will take me hours to dry my very thick hair! Several of my friends have one and raved about how good it is, but I feel it was a complete waste of my $60! So disappointed!",1,25,B01LSUQSB0
"I've had this hair dryer about a week, and am still trying to get the hang of it. Some days my hair looks bouncy and amazingly fabulous. The next day, I'll think I'm drying my hair the same exact way, but clearly I'm not because my hair turns out stick straight and just meh. But, here's the thing -- I have naturally frizzy hair and live in south Florida, so stick straight is something no other hair dryer ever remotely achieved, let alone amazingly maintaining my hair in that state all day. So, even on a relatively bad hair day, it's still performing a miracle. The other thing that amazes me about this dryer, and I don’t know how this works, is that it does not get stuck/tangled — and I say this as someone who routinely gets a regular round brush stuck in my hair. I just need to practice more to get the hang of it. It's also very, very fast. My main problem is that I somehow keep singeing my left thumb (I'm right handed). Haven't figured out how to keep it out of the way, I guess. I also wish it had a hanging loop so I don’t have to hang it from the cord.",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"It gave my fine limp hair volume, even better than a salon blowout! I cannot go be 5 stars because I have only used it three times and the bristles are coming off. I will have to exchange and see if I got a defective product.",3,49,B01LSUQSB0

"I have extremely curly hair that is at least 4 inches past my shoulders. It is also colored. I normally wash, dry and flat iron my hair twice a week.

Pros:
The Revlon One Step dryer lets me dry my hair and straighten it at the same time and gives me a fuller look which I can not achieve with a flat iron.
It maintains the ""fluffy"" look until my next wash.
It really works well if you dry your hair in smallish sections and has reduced the time spent on my hair by at least 1/3.
You can also quickly dry your hair with a traditional dryer and then run this through in largish sections to straighten and curl.

Cons:
This device gets really hot so be careful not to hold too close to your face for a long period of time. I switch between the high and low settings.
It is a bit difficult to change the settings if you want to set your curl on cool, when the device is in your hair.
It is also a little heavy and very loud but I feel it is worth it.",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"No soy de comprar artículos porque la gente lo esté recomendando pero escuché tantas maravillas de este cepillo que lo pre ordene porque no estaba disponible.
Mi cabello es rizado con varias texturas desde las 3b a 4b, no suelo secarme el cabello y menos por mi misma.
Llegó antes del tiempo estimado.
El color es hermoso más verde que azul.
Seca rápido el pelo y pese a que no es tan pesado, para el que no esté acostumbrado a secarse por si mismo puede ser algo agotador.
Trae un pequeñito mango arriba el cepillo para ayudar a girarlo pero esté se sobre calienta por lo que es recomendable colocarse un guante.
Pese a que da caliente no molesta tanto en Los oídos.
Mi única queja y por la cual no le doy 5 estrellas, es que a medida que se fue calentando tanto las letras de la marca como las que indican la temperatura se fueron borrando y lo que me molestó es que mancho el mango del cepillo de manera que no se retira.
Para la calidad que es eso me lo encontré extraño pues es el mango del mismo y es por donde se debe sostener por lo que esa pintura debería ser más resistente; más que todo porque estropea el color.
En mi caso el cabello duro presentable mientras estuve en casa y las puntas nunca se aplacaron, pero repito mi cabello es rizo y no suelo darle caliente; en un cabello más lacio debe funcionar al 100.
En cuanto a si lo recomiendo o no, para quieres se secan en casa y les gusta llevar el cabello lacio es una buena opción pero para hacer que dure deberás terminar de darle caliente a las puntas con plancha y como es un cepillo no quita las ondas del todo de la raíz pero a la vez no hace un mal trabajo.",4,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I have thick Polynesian hair and when I cut it short I needed something to make blow outs easier. I had the hardest time following the same techniques my hairstylist did -dryer in one hand, round brush in the other- and had given up... But! This tool is a game changer! It's easy to run through my hair and I love to volume. It does a nice enough job that I don't flat iron anymore! Definitely salon quality looking results. It can get a bit heavy as the base requires a hefty grip, but nothing too strenuous.",5,11,B01LSUQSB0
"This has changed my hair. I have very frizzy, thin, coarse, tangle prone hair that is never smooth and never had volume. This product gave me a new head of hair. It makes my hair silky smooth with lots of volume that lasts all day, and even stays smooth into the next day. Total game changer. I have completely stopped using all of my other tools and brushes, and can get ready in under 5 minutes. Even with expensive round brushes, I could never get my hair to grab and stay in the brush while blow drying, and afterwards I’d still have coarse tangles. This easily grabs and hold my hair while it works and I can keep rolling it through my hair and it holds everything. It’s amazing! It’s better than when I get salon blow-outs.

That being there are a few very important things to note that other reviewers have mentioned:

1. It can only be plugged into certain plugs. Read the details before buying because it clearly states it is not safe for specific electrical outlets.
2. I read reviews and heard from friends about burning smells, so I never use this on high. Ever. The low setting works great on damp hair. I either shower and give myself time to let my hair towel dry a bit so that it’s damp, or if I’m in a big rush I will blast it with the blow dryer very quick and then use this. If you use on fully wet hair it will take much longer.
3. The high setting is very loud, as mentioned in other reviews. Another reason to only use the low setting. Using the low setting on damp hair, I can still be fully dry and styled in under 5 minutes.
4. It is big and you can’t hold it with one hand. Why buy one tool that you can’t use with one hand? Because it’s still easier to use than two separate tools. You won’t even realize.

Honestly, it’s incredible. I am never going back.",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"UPDATE!!!
I have had and used this for now 8 months. It worked great and gave so much volumizing in the beginning, but with continued use, it is falling apart and does NOT work great at all! The heavier bristles are completely bent on the curved sides. Some of them also now have a burnt look to them. The soft bristles are very squished and are falling out with use! I haven't even used it for daily use and clean it after ever other use. I don't have very thick hair and I even seperate my hair into 5 sections to dry. My hair is completely combed through before use, so I'm not ""brushing"" my hair when using it.
The idea of this is fantastic, but the construction NEEDS work! I've always used round brushes for volume and the tough bristles on those are so much thicker and can withstand much more pressure (which is very needed for this item!). If they used those bristles instead, this would be better.
I thought about buying another, but for this price point ($35-$60), this should've lasted a lot longer. I truly hope Revlon read this review and improves it.
*including pictures*

I love the way this dryer works. It makes my hair so smooth and gives it good volume, however, I had to have mine replaced within a month of daily use. It was working one day, then started blowing out less air and making a horrible noise. So far the new one is working fine in the same amount of time (knock on wood).
Things I do not like are the heaviness of it. I wish that there was a medium setting. The high gets very hot, but the low takes too long for my hair.",1,2,B01LSUQSB0
"This is the real deal ladies!! I am so shook right now it's unreal. I bought this based of of about 30 youtube reviews. I was super skeptical, I mean a brush with a built-in blow dryer that doesn't frizz, adds shine, volume, and lift.... I was not holding my breath. But this this is magic, I will never use my $300 straightener again. The settings are amazing, the heat is no joke, and the shine is unbelievable. BUY THIS NOW, THANK ME LATER.",5,3,B01LSUQSB0
"Got this when I had right hand surgery. Suddenly using hair dryer AND brush is impossible. I’ve used it twice now. Dried my long thick hair quickly. It softens and smoothes my (post-menopausal) wild wavy hair beautifully. The only thing I worry about is the heat. It’s pretty extreme and the low setting isn’t for low heat, it’s for less air flow.
It does do the one-handed hair drying trick for me, I just flip sections over to the left side of my head as I dry them. It’s easy to use. I used the “cool” setting to finish off the drying and set my ends.
Like I said, my big concern is the extreme heat. I don’t want to damage my hair...but I love the way it makes my hair look. I’m just going to be monitoring my hair health closely!",3,3,B01LSUQSB0
"UPDATE:*** I fell in love the first time I used this!! HOWEVER*** I have only had it March 12th and it is making a loud noises and not heating properly as if its defective and its past my return date to exchange on Amazon(April 8th) ! GRRRR! This is frustrating due to it being $47 and barely having it a month!!
Don't waste your time; Look into another brand Revlon sucks with this product

Definitely a game changer for people with thick curly hair. My her wasn't frizzy on rainy days as usual. I have a Bob haircut and I love how I can roll my hair under with this. It usually takes me well over an hour and 20 minutes easily to blow dry and straightener my hair. With this , took me 25-30 minutes to BLOW DRY. I DIDNT EVEN HAVE TO STRAIGHTEN MY HAIR!!!! TOTAL GAME CHANGER FOR SURE. Temperature isn't regulated I don't think, it does get extremely too hot to the touch but I just take breaks and allow my hair to cool down as well as the dryer brush. Take breaks as a precaution. Other than that, LOVE IT!",1,One,B01LSUQSB0
"This could be a great tool with some design improvements. Its rather large and takes some practice to get used to, especially if you have small hands. The brush head is a large oval, which I can't understand. It should be round. The long flat sides are pretty useless.
Also, there are boar bristles around the plastic bristles only on the short ends of the oval. There needs to be boar bristles all over the brush to grip hair.
As it is, this tool isn't able to straighten curly or wavy hair for a decent ""blow out"" effect. The air flow isn't powerful enough and the standard plastic bristles don't provide resistance to pull hair straight. So, you'll need to use a flat iron to finish the job.
It is quieter than a hair dryer, which is nice for not waking others in the early morning hours.
I really wanted to like this dryer, but I'll probably go back to my regular hair dryer and boar bristle round brush. Very disappointing.",2,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I had seen this product on social media and how amazing it made other people's hair look, so I thought I would try it out myself. I was, of course, a bit skeptical because social media can sometimes be decieving, but this tool works like a charm! I recently got a haricut and I love my short hair, but I still hated taking showers in the morning because my hair is still thick and takes a while to blow dry. With this tool, I can blow dry my soaking wet hair in about 15-20 minutes and damp hair in about 10 minutes. That is amazing timing by my standards and I'm so glad I can take less time blow drying and styling my hair now! I can also just leave my hair alone and not style it and add even more heat to it even after I've blow dried it because this tool styles it for me! Highly reccomend this to make your life easier!",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I was very skeptical when I first started hearing about this product because I've had bad luck with items like this in the past just being difficult to use on my curly hair and/or dying before I could actually give it a shot. I finally caved after all of the popularity and recommendations. Shipping was good, fast. When I used it for the first time I was SOO impressed at how powerful and hot it got and what it did for my hair. I was ecstatic. Used it a 2nd and 3rd time and finally decided to declare my love for this product to everyone I knew. A week later I plugged it in to use and it no longer blows out hot air :( I was devastated because it really changed the hair game for me, and now I'm back to a regular old hair dryer. I wanted to love this - I really did but now after reading everyone else's reviews and seeing the same problem I would suggest to hold off until Revlon can correct this problem. Until then maybe look into a more high end brand? I know lots of other higher end brands have their own version of this.",1,2,B01LSUQSB0
"Update: I bought this dryer a few months ago and I instantly fell in love. (see review below). I have personally been responsible for the sale of over 20 of the beauties - that's how good it is. I told two friends and they told two friends and so on.... and every time I tell someone about it, they run out and buy it and can't wait to call/text/ email me about how much they love it. Does it get hot? Yes! Very hot? Yep! Do you need a thermal protector? Heck yes! But the results are just amazing.

Original review: I had been looking at this tool for months, but could not bring myself to pull the trigger and buy it. I have purchased so many blow dryer/styling tools and none of them have worked on my extremely thick, very curly, course long hair. Instead I would go to salon at least once a week to get a blowout. And if I didn't have time for that, I would blow dry, then flat iron and then use heated curlers to get my hair straight and smooth and it still wasn't great. I finally bought the Revlon One Step Dryer - and like many other reviews say, it's a game changer. Goodbye flat iron. Goodbye heated rollers. This thing does it all and it does it fast. My long hair takes 10 minutes, start to finish, and it looks close to a professional blowout.

A few things to note - the ""cool"" setting isn't really cool. I wish it were. Also, if you have damaged, dry hair - I wouldn't use the high setting. It's gets very hot and would cause further damage. And make sure you use a heat protecter spray. Because it gets so hot, I wonder if the motor will burn out as other reviewers have reported. Also, don't use on dripping wet hair. I let me hair air dry a bit and then use the the dryer.",5,3,B01LSUQSB0
"I researched this product and watched several videos before I decided to purchase it. Problem was nothing available in Canada. Every site was sold out. I found it on Amazon US and ordered it. It was shipped Monday and arrived the next day. I kid you not. I can’t even post a letter in Canada in the same town and get it the very next day. I skipped off to the courier to pick up this magical appliance that the reviews promised would change my hair and life.
I pulled it out of the packaging and already knew by the reviews that it’s a little heavy. Put a little bit of leave in conditioner and divided my hair into sections and started it up. First of all if you have read any reviews you already know this sucker gets hot and fast! Hold the end and don’t touch the brush itself. Keep your fingers out of the line of fire or they will get burned. I flipped between the highest and lowest setting as I was worried I would burn my hair. Next time I use it I’ll use a heat protector. My hair is a hot mess at the best of times. Getting tangled when I use the wrong shampoo. I was concerned that I would roll in the brush and it would get stuck. Having to cut it out and going to work with a big chunk of hair missing. Didn’t happen. Use that leave in conditioner if you’re a little nervous about bald spots like I am. You know what, use it anyway. Don’t damage your hair!! I used one big clip and put it on the top of my head. Next time I’ll use smaller clips so I don’t have to keep shutting off the hair drier to reposition my hair. It did allow the hair drier to cool down a little though.
It dried my hair in half the time of my regular hair drier. In the past I had to dump a bunch of oil on my hair so that the fuzziness and fly aways will stay down, this drier left my hair smooth, silky and honestly it looked like I just left my hair stylist. I haven’t put any other product on it. My ends are nicely curled and I have a little bit of volume. I wanted to see if the fuzzies would creep up but so far 3 hours later it still looks beautiful!
If you’re wondering if it really works the answer is yes! I have shoulder length, colored, damaged locks and today it’s the nicest I’ve ever styled and without that silly flat iron!!",5,3,B01LSUQSB0
"I don't know why I waited so long to buy this, because it has been a game changer with getting my basic bob to do what I want in a fraction of the time a blow dryer/round brush would do. Very easy to use, especially if you've been a slave to a round brush and dryer like me. That being said, there is a learning curve to it, at least for me. In my opinion, if you treat it as you would your prior heat styling tools, your hair will not benefit.

The first time I used it, I took a ""less is more"" approach. My hair was slightly damp, not wet and of course I had heat protectant in it. I sectioned my hair the best I could and only used the low setting. With constantly keeping the brush moving (slower than if you were brushing your hair, but no pausing like you may with a blow dryer or straightener), in like 5 minutes I looked like I had just come home from a salon, dry, perfectly shaped, shiny, and frizz free. LOVED it. Yet when I used it again, I started getting bolder and attempted holding it in place and mimicking what I've seen other women do with theirs. As a result, it took longer, my hair was angry and frizzy and I thought my purchase had been a mistake. Total USER error. All it took was me going back to that initial approach and I am back to feeling like a million bucks.

My point is, this brush is AMAZING, but you need to let go of how you used your prior tools. If you are taking just as long to do your hair as with other tools, please try reevaluating your technique. If you do that, you'll be able to achieve what you want, but reduce the heat impact on your hair which is always a win and is ultimately the main benefit of this tool. Less stress on your hair, with major benefits. Hoping that idea holds true with continued use.

I can't speak to the malfunctions others are having, but after a few uses, I recommend this brush. For reference, I have a chin length, slightly stacked bob and my hair is definitely more on thick side with a slight wave. Yes, it may seem bulky and bigger than you're used to but again, but nothing crazy if you're used to a blow dryer. I have not burnt myself, so maybe just use common sense when you're holding it?

On the other hand though, I do wish there were better temperature adjustments, however with my approach of not letting the brush linger in my hair, I'm not worried. We'll see what my stylist has to say on the condition of my hair once I go back in March and I'll update the review as needed.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"First of all... this thing is huge, I know dimensions are listed but I didn't pay attention! It's pretty loud (although more dryers are as well, but funny note the noise annoys my cat, can't leave bathroom door open as she'll run in an start yelling at me, nipping my ankle!!). I haven't used it on very wet hair, it does ""dry"" very lightly damp hair, but it does not smooth mine at all, I still have to used a straightener if I want it smooth, and I haven't figured out if it can give any ""curl or wave"" (tried it a few times, only makes my wavy hair straight). Still not bad if my plan was to straighten my hair, and not want to use a dryer and round brush to dry first. Easy to clean hair out (I hate leaving hair in brushes etc!! Lol)",2,One,B01LSUQSB0
"If you have two left hands when it comes to blowing out your hair this product will surely help you! It does a great job at adding volume and decreasing the dry time and effort by combining tools. I will say though, this gets very hot on high or low setting. The settings seems to be related to force of air and not so much related to temperature. That is the only downside! My hair still requires some touch up with a straightener after because it it’s frizzy but my sister has a smoother hair texture and she is able to just use this tool for her whole routine.",4,4,B01LSUQSB0
"Overall - LOVE this! It gets my hair so perfect, silky and frizz free.

Couple things to be aware of - this does get VERY hot if you use it on the high setting, so make sure you are starting with hair that is already air dried and use a heat protectant to minimize damage. I let my hair dry about 70% and then I will section and go through with this dryer. It does get your hair dry pretty quickly if you aren’t starting with dripping wet hair. I could see you damaging your hair if you were not careful with how long you let the brush be on your hair.

It does have a low setting that isn’t quite as hot, and a cool setting. I wish it had more options for turning the heat up or down but I’m still really happy with this.

FYI try to snag this on sale. Ulta has done sales with this dryer several times, so you should definitely be able to pick it up under $50.",5,3,B01LSUQSB0
"Simply amazing. I have enough hair for 4 people. When I walk into a hair salon, I don't feel welcomed. The workers fight with each other on who should do my hair. They don't want to do it. So needless to say, I try to do my own hair when I can. Blow drying is tons of work. Not only does it take me 2 hours. Its extremely tiring on my arms holding a brush and a blow dryer. I've seen so many ads for this product. I read reviews on great it is and how it cuts half the time. So I decided to give it a try when I saw how cheap it cost. Wow. Best decision ever!!! So much easier with holding just one thing in my hands. Reaching the back has always been a problem for me before. Now I had no issues in getting every hair right and it took me less than an hour!!! I love it!! Now when I want to wear my hair straight, it won't be such a task. Just a few things. I did it straight out of the shower. I think if I would have let my hair dry a little bit first.. It might have been faster to blow dry. Also. I didn't buy any products to put on my wet hair first to give it an extra shine. And since my hands are soooo dry from the constant washing, the heat of the dryer on my hands hurt a little due to my severely dry hands. I have b4 and after pics but it is not giving me an option to upload.",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"My sister bought one and she really liked it. Our hair is different, so I was skeptical about buying this at first. I decided to give it a try and I absolutely love it! I am now able to straighten my hair more often without the extra work. What used to take me an hour or longer to straighten my hair now only takes 20 minutes or less. I have really curly hair. I would use both the blow dryer and the straightener since that was the only thing that would work to make my hair look nice. It was a lot of work and my arms would get tired. My other option was going to the salon which would cost a lot of money. With this dryer brush it cuts my time and makes my hair look really nice. I can now get the salon look at home. I also told some of my coworkers about it and they love it too. It not only straighten and dries but it adds volume. I love it and would definitely purchase it again.",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"WOW. To begin with, I’m very spastic when it comes to straightening my hair. For the last 30 years I have had chemical perms put in my hair to keep it curly so I don’t have to spend a lot of time styling it. My daughter-in-law is a salon owner. She did a Brazilian blowout on my hair, most of of the permanent chemical curl disappeared. She made it look beautiful, but I knew the next time I washed my hair at home, I would be in a mess trying to style it. I have so many styling tools I could open a store!! Nothing works well trying to coordinate both hands with a dryer and brush, or flat iron and a comb. Especially the back of my head looking in the mirror. Lol. This product out of the box really was intimidating. Huge compared to a regular size brush. But was not heavy. My hair is med length past my shoulders, thick and layered. I sectioned it off, turned on the drying tool, and I could not Believe how easy my hair was dried and straightened with one hand! I did use the end with both hands when I would get near the bottom of my hair to make sure it was smooth. Not a tangle through my entire head! Oval Design is perfect! I would suggest you dry the roots of your hair with a reg hair dryer with a straight skinny attachment for 2 or 3 mins if you have thick longish hair like mine. Or let your hair air dry somewhat. I used mine about 10 mins after I washed my hair. I am most pleased that I Finally found a hair tool that works for me without a lot of time and hassle going into my hair! I will never go back to chemical perms again! I highly recommend this product to everyone, especially if you have issues trying to straighten you hair. My only complaint is it did not come in Purple!!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"let me start by saying my preferred way to wear my hair is straight, but because of how long and thick my hair is it takes waaaay too long for me to do my hair as often as i would like to. usually i air dry my hair on wash day, and straighten it the next day IF i’m planning on styling my hair. this thing is magic!! it just gave me a beautiful sleek blowout in less than 20 minutes!!! i know that may seem like a lot of time compared to other reviewers but my hair is extremely long and THICK so this was a miracle!!! usually it takes me 1.5-2 hours to get my hair as straight as i like with my high end flat iron, this gave me the same results in less than a 1/4 of the time!!!! absolutely love this styling tool and will be purchasing as gifts for my friends!! the pic attached shows one side using this dryer on my dry hair and the other side is natural and brushed out",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"If you think this isn’t meant for your type of hair - give it a chance. I had this on my wishlist for over a year and just finally bought it. I always thought my hair was too thick or too curly or too long, and it just wouldn’t work for me. I hate blow drying my hair because it takes so long and I don’t even know how to do it well with a regular brush. Even when I get my hair blown out at the salon, I find that my hair gets flat on top because of the weight of the rest of my hair. This product changed everything! I’ve never had such an easy time blowing out my hair and I somehow magically ended up with a ton of volume. It’s loud and it still will take a while if you have a lot of hair but it’s literally as simple as brushing your hair, you don’t need any skill to finesse it the way you do with a regular dryer.",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I have fine hair and it does not hold curl. The revlon one step gives my fine limp hair volume. Its like I came from the salon. I am not good with using a brush and blow dryer and having to set 1 item down to separate and grab another section of my hair. With this I don't have to. There are 3 settings the high is very hot, low still hot and cool which is not as cool as my blow-dry that is the only reason I gave this 4 stars. If there was more setting on a way to do high with lower heat and cool to be cooler it would be perfect. I live in a humid climate and it works but if its raining out I would need to use a straightener to keep the frizz away. Overall I am pleased with my purchase and would recommend this product for a salon like blowout.",4,2,B01LSUQSB0
"I have thick, coarse, wavy hair. This is the kind of product that I should know better than to buy, but the reviews on this thing were AMAZING. As soon as I read that someone with thick hair had stored away their flat iron, I would have paid ANYTHING for this product.

So, my hopes were high. This didn't deliver. The drying time was comparable to a hair dryer. However, it is much louder. My device had a really high-pitched ringing that might have been a defect. My ears actually hurt when I was finished, which can't be healthy. I dried half of my hair with the styler and half with a regular hair dryer and hair brush. As you can see, the results look almost the same. The styler side does have more volume as promised, but the volume is coming from frizz. It was slightly better at straightening, but not well enough to shelve the flat iron. It was nice to be able to brush my hair while simultaneously drying, but it just causes frizz.

All in all, nothing about this device is worth it to me. It's too loud and painful with not enough straightening power. I honestly don't know how other wavy thick-haired women reviewed this so highly. I could see this working well for straight hair types not prone to frizz. 0/10 for me.",1,One,B01LSUQSB0
"This hair dryer gives great volume & lift to hair from the root w/o all the fuss of having to constantly use a round brush & hair dryer to achieve a “blow out” look. Has 3 heat settings, cool, low, & high. I love this hair dryer/brush combo, the brush grabs the hair easily w/o putting too much tension on the hair. Works well on my thin, fine hair that is either partially air dried w/products on or wetted down w/products on. Dries the hair quickly & I can blow out my short/med asymmetrical bob in about 15 min.
My only 2 complaints are that 1. It is a bit heavy & 2. The heat controls are on the end of the brush meaning you have to switch between high & cool settings by turning the control on the end while the brush is curled in your hair, which takes some dexterity to do. Otherwise this is an excellent hair tool, highly recommend!",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I don’t buy stuff randomly, I ask for recommendations. My cousin kept bragging about it and whatnot. She has curly hair, like I do, and it’s pretty healthy.

First couple of uses (bought April 2020)- I noticed the only way it would work is if I let my hair air dry quite a bit first (about 2-3 hours) and then it would straighten my hair- this was after my cousin told me that is how it would straighten hers. The low temperature did nothing however it would dry on high, causing my small apartment to get a bunch of smoke.

Fast forward Halloween 2020- I can officially say Rest In Peace to this brush, the fuse just blew up.

Short and sweet- if you’re Hispanic and have curly hair that’s healthy: this is not for you. If you live in a small NY apartment: also not for you.",1,4,B01LSUQSB0
"I saw this product on CNN's feature of cool things to buy, and having always wanted to be able to style my hair in a way that looks professional, but bereft of talent or ability, I decided to try it. I'm glad I did, With this airbrush, I can almost meet my objective. My hair, which is very thin, manages to look thicker and almost chic! I almost always had to wear it in a ponytail when not visiting a hair stylist, but with this, I can wear my hair down for a few days and it looks pretty good. My only wish is that the brush was a tad bit smaller as to be able to get my hair to wave a bit. But other than that, I'm pretty happy with this product. It's better than anything I've tried before.",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I was quite excited to try this hairdryer. My friend bought a similar brand and had great results. It’s much larger in diameter than I thought. In spite of its size it’s easy to use. You quickly get use to the size and weight. Bristle tip to tip is 4” diameter, the central core is 2.75” oval shape and where you hold the hairdryer is 5” in diameter. The total length is 15”. It’s rather large, but I wear an 8.5 ring so I had no problem. This hairdryer might be a great choice for longer (longer than 4-5”), more hair or thicker hair. My hair is thin, very fine and short. I only gave It 3 stars b/c I had high expectations for my thin fine hair.",3,2,B01LSUQSB0
"This Revlon brush hair dryer is a WINNER!!!! I have extremely curly hair! And this product is a blessing! I typically either air dry and wear curly. But since it’s freezing outdoors (and to minimize washing my hair every 3 days) I needed an alternative to my Conair Dryer with the adapter combs to drying my hair when wanting a relaxed or “straight hair” look. When I usually straighten (I’m sure you ladies know this process) I wash, condition, towel dry, comb out the curls, put all of the products in (including heat protectant) and begin to blow dry (for me it takes 1.5 hours to fully dry my hair), then style with a flat iron. This product saved me an entire hour of hair work! Today I washed, towel dried my hair, put my products in (leave in conditioner cream and spray, biosilk serum, and Chi heat protectant), air dried about 3 hours to multitask while I’m working from home, combed it and began to use this Revlon jewel! Some parts were still damp. But OMG the entire process for dry my chin length curly hair took 25-30 minutes on the highest setting. Then topped it off with 3-5 mins of drying on the cool setting to avoid frizz. Photo 1 shows how I normally wear my hair (air dried with no frizz serum, a little bit of coconut cream and leave in conditioner), and photos 2 & 3 show my hair before the Revlon air brush — hair air dried and combed prior to the Revlon blow dry... and with the brush it’s silky smooth. PLEASE order this product! I purchased one for my mother to gift to her from Target (they’re selling them for $57 at my local Target and the store honored the Amazon price, which was wayyy cheaper!).",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"My hair is fine texture but medium amount, wavy/curly, length is about four inches below the shoulder. It's prone to frizz/flyaways and knots.

This dryer does help generate a straight look, but it doesn't completely eliminate fly-aways. It takes a long time to dry with the Revlon dryer because I have to use it on the low setting. The high setting is too hot for my hair. I've found it more effective to use a travel dryer first on my roots (head flipped downward) then section hair off and use the Revlon dryer. That way drying doesn't take so long and it also seems to give a bit more body than the Revlon dryer alone gives.

It will rip out your hair if you don't start at the ends to work out the knots first (like combing or brushing). It doesn't make my hair as smooth and shiny as a flat iron, but it also doesn't do as much damage as one.

I use one drop of argan oil mixed with a little water and work it through my hair before drying. I don't use styling or heat formulas (most have chemicals that are unhealthy for us and environment), so your results may differ from mine.

Worth owning, just don't expect miracles.",3,3,B01LSUQSB0
"I complimented a coworkers hair one day and made a “I wish I had time for that” comment and then she clued me into the magic that is this brush. I have very long and thick hair. And when I say thick...I don’t just mean a lot of it. The strands of my hair are thicker and course. My sister n law said it’s almost like horse hair. 🤷🏻‍♀️ If...and I mean IF I decided to style it, it took a good 30-45 minutes just to dry it. Longer if from shower wet instead of more damp. I can’t just dry my hair because it goes waaayy past frizzy. So, if I dry it I have to straighten in if I want it down. Add on at least another 30 minutes. Yeah...I don’t have time for that. Both times I’ve used this, I have used it with been in a bun for a few hours post shower damp hair. The first time (first two pics black tshirt) took me a little longer as I’m not used to a round brush at all. It took me 45 minutes. The second time my hair was up all day before I used it so it was a bit more dry, but it took me 29 minutes. Now, it’s not perfectly hair straightener straight, but.....it is awesome! Anything that can cut my hair prep time almost in half (so I’m not always rocking the hot mess mom bun I am known for) is AWESOME! I’ve only had it for a short while now and can update later if there are changes, but to far...it’s love!",4,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I cannot possibly say enough about this tool. I thought it was overhyped, which is why it took me so long to actually buy my first one. (YES I SAID MY FIRST ONE BECAUSE OF COURSE I BOUGHT A SECOND ONE, JUST IN CASE THEY EVER DISCONTINUE IT OR THE FIRST ONE BREAKS. DON'T JUDGE ME, I HAVE SCARCITY ISSUES.) If you don't like the way your hair looks after a $75 blowout, you probably shouldn't buy this amazing tool. If you like spending fortunes on volumizing products you wouldn't need if you just bought this MAGICAL GIFT TO HUMAN HAIR, carry on. I am sure you will be very happy and not at all regretful as you continue to struggle to wield your 40-pound blowdryer in one hand and a ginormous round brush in the other for the rest of ever while you go broke feeding your mousse addiction. Enjoy!",5,4,B01LSUQSB0
I loved this hair dryer for the month and a half I used it (or the month and a half it was actually working). I was telling everyone about it and how great it was...now the heat setting has stopped working and it no longer dries my hair. I’m really disappointed because this was the hair tool of my dreams.,1,14,B01LSUQSB0
"I just used it for the first time and I'm blown away. Easy, quick, lightweight. Yes, I have to put it down when sectioning my hair but so what. I did that with a roll brush in one hand and a regular blow dryer in the other. I got this with a $10 off coupon too (however tax is calculated at full price?). The Bed Head is exactly like the Revlon as they are owned by the same company and are identical except for color choices. I will only use the low setting as my hair is thinner than when I was younger. Also, I just don't want to fry it. The only real difference is my hair is stick straight vs. the roll/body from my boar bristle roll brush that sets more ""body"" into the styling. But so what; I'd rather have soft straight hair in half the time. I did use a heat protectant spray on top of my Moroccan Oil which I never did with roll brush, slow dry with my Solana. I also flat ironed my bangs and the frizzies around the sides (although honestly, very little frizz if at all). You don't get much lift from the root, or I didn't because I don't want to hold it against my scalp long enough to set that lift in, but I clip it up after washing to give extra boost, or a few velcro rollers at the crown. Anyway....best hair tool yet. I can see why these are flying off the shelves.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I bought this because I was having wrist surgery and knew I wouldn't be able to manage the blow dryer and brush together as I would only be able to use one hand for awhile after surgery. It does work and straightens hair nicely, way better than with a brush and blow dryer (but not as well as having my stylist do it) but it does have some issues, which is why I only gave 4 stars. First off, it's HEAVY. Really heavy. Although I work out with weights several times a week I find that it gets so heavy that I have to stop and put it down a few times throughout a drying session (I have shoulder-length hair and it takes about 20 min to dry my hair). Plus it is really big. Way bigger than the biggest round brush. Also, it only has 3 settings: cool, low, and high. For both the low and high setting the heat is so intense that I have to hold it way away from my skin or it will burn my scalp and neck. It would be better if there were a medium heat setting, or if the hot setting was not quite so hot. Finally, since it is a brush it doesn't dry my roots well so I have to use a conventional blow dryer to dry my roots first then use this product to dry/straighten the ends. Overall it's a very good product, as it really does straighten hair better than using a brush and blow dryer.",4,One,B01LSUQSB0
"If you have hair, you probably need this beast in your life! I just got it today, used it once and I'm stupid in love with Revlon's volumizer. My hair is old and straight as a yardstick. It's thin and soft and fine and was born to just lay there, not very interested in styling. The short, straight bob was the best trend that ever happened to my head. But I've got the curling iron burn scars to prove my lifelong attempts at getting some
volume and covering up an uncooperative cowlick. This thing is the answer. It dried and shaped my hair in just a few minutes, it was easy to use and it isn't so heavy that only half my head got done. About the temperature settings: the hot setting gets pretty hot. The other settings are great, though, you just might not want to use the high/hot setting every day, as I could see some hair frying happening with overuse. The price point is fair, I think, as the Revlon does just what it says it will for my type of hair. I will note that I'm a long-time cord coiler, and the first bit on the instructions cautioned against it. I noticed some reviewers complained that their dryer stopped working, and I could absolutely see myself messing it up by mistreating the cord. My cool, voluminous hair and I are going to try to do better.",5,2,B01LSUQSB0
"I needed to replace my hair dryer, and thought I'd try this out. I figured I would get a hair dryer too, but wanted to give this a shot first. That was 2 months ago, and I don't feel like I need a hair dryer. It is extremely easy to use, and it does a fabulous job that lasts as long as the salon if you take your time with it. It works best if you give your hair a little time to air dry first and don't try to completely dry your hair right out of the shower. The only problem (and it hasn't been a problem yet) that I could see with this design is that the brush bristles get smushed down when you hold your hair tightly against it. I wonder if it will need to be replaced sooner than a hair dryer would... but as far as the job it does... can't be beat!!",4,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I love this dryer. Works EXACTLY as it claims. I have hair down to my waist and I was struggling to blow it out with a regular hair dryer and a round brush. The Revlon One-step is perfect! I get smooth, straight, soft hair with very little effort. I do feel like the dryer can get too hot if I run it on “high” the entire time. So once in a while I change the temp setting to cool and let it blow off all it’s heat then switch back to “high.” Running the dryer on cool for a minute or so just makes my hair even shinier. I do want to be clear that I have had absolutely no problems with the dryer overheating and malfunctioning. I just have a lot of hair and like to give it a break or two throughout the drying process. It took me a few sessions to get used to holding the fat body of the dryer instead of a slimmer hair brush handle. I also do a lot of long strokes from roots to ends of hair and not so much rolling the hair up to get a curl. When I’m done I have long, smooth, shiny hair for very little work. This is honestly one of those products that works as advertised and does it so well you just can’t believe it. I liked it so much, I’ve bought 2 more and sent them to my sister and a friend as gifts.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"This thing is great. My 10 year old has curly thin/fine hair and hasn't quite learned how to care for it. She typically uses a blow dryer and paddle brush to ""straighten"" it...however after using this revlon one step...she doesn't want anything to do with a blow dryer. Her hair was left shiney and smoothe looking. It's extremely easy to use. It does take a little bit to dry towards the scalp....so instead of using it underneath we ran it over the top of the sections a few times to help dry it more prior to using it underneath. I have tons of hair; it's thicker, longer and curly so I'll be curious to know how it works on my hair as far as drying time. Due to the bulkiness it doesn't get close to the scalp...we found it easier to hold the section of hair straight out or up and use it underneath. It does tend to create a few flyaways but a little shine spray can cure after or she just ran a brush through it and flipped her hair and it was good. The low level doesn't get quite as hot so it was easier on her scalp when it was close but she tolerated the high level which is hotter...you don't keep it at the scalp anyway. I would recommend this product based solely on the experience we had with my daughters hair. Again her hair is thin, fine, and curly...not sure how it'll work on thicker more curly long hair.",4,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Soy incredula en todo lo que anuncian, hasta no investigar y leer reseñas no tomo la decisión de la compra, y mas en este producto de los cuales hay varios en el mercado mucho mas económicos. Pero definitivamente lo mas caro es lo mejor ( en este caso). Me dejo impactada la facilidad para manejarlo, ya que su mango es algo ancho para mi mano, pero no se resbala y no se calienta, puedes agarrar la punta para ayudarte en el cepillado y no se calienta, no sientes un calor excesivo como si te fueras a quemar como pasa con el secador o plancha cuando se acerca mucho al cuero cabelludo con este cepillo te sientes segura para manipularlo, realmente la temperatura se debe tener presente para la calidad de tu cabello, yo lo tengo ondulado suelto así que lo uso en LOW y es apenas bien no necesitan aumentar, hay otros productos que así lo digan las indicaciones siempre toca usar un valor superior al indicado. Se enfría rápido así que no tienes que esperar eternidades para guardarlo, genial para viajes. VALE LA PENA LA INVERSION y ademas tienes 4 años de Garantía",5,2,B01LSUQSB0
"This product is incredible. I have thick, medium length, wavy hair. It used to take me at least 30 minutes to just dry my hair and then another 45-60 minutes to straighten it. With this dryer, my hair is dried AND styled in 30 minutes total time! Even more amazing, it gives my hair a full, natural bounce, just as how it looks when I get a blowout from a salon. Oh my goodness this item is going to put salons out of business.

I no longer have to coordinate social events with days that I have extended time to dry and style my hair. I can now wash, dry, and wear my hair and go out looking fabulous (even days later). Feel like a whole new woman!!!!

It is slightly bulky and loud, but I am entirely satisfied and HIGHLY recommend this product.",5,4,B01LSUQSB0
"I have a good amount of long hair and it really did dry the sections fast and left them smooth. I couldn't get that curled under look like some, but it did have a gentle shape that was nice. It also gets very hot so I used heat for 2 passes, switched to cool and the residual heat on the brush dried hair without over drying. If I left on full heat I think I'd have damage. Buttons hard to move between without looking at. Other than that, easy to use.",5,2,B01LSUQSB0
"There’s only 4 settings to choose from, off,low,cool and hot/high. I can’t exactly remember the name of the settings but you only get 4.
I really love using this blow dryer brush, if I could choose how hot i can make the hot setting this would be all 5 stars, perfect for the price and ease of use.
If I use the brush on the high hot setting I can see my hair start smoking which is not a good thing and if I use it on the cool setting only my hair gets super frizzy. The best way I have found to use the brush is by sectioning my hair and starting with the high hot setting and drying the section of hair until it’s almost dry then switch to the cool setting and finish drying the section, not only will my hair be smooth but also very shiny. I do use a heat protector serum and my hair has the smallest amount of frizz but that’s from all the bleach I’ve used on my hair. I have my cosmetology license even though I don’t work in a salon anymore but even the professional tools I have don’t compare. There’s definitely a learning curve but it’s 100% the money and more. If it was not as loud as it is even with the few setting options it would get 5++++ star review.",4,2,B01LSUQSB0
"I've only had the Revlon One-Set Dryer & Volumizer for a few days; however, given the demand for this item, I wanted to share my two cents. I find the unit to be a bit on the heavy side. If you have limited upper body strength - this unit is not for you! You definitely want to make sure you let your hair air dry as much as possible before using this. Perhaps even use a regular hair dryer to take the dampness out of your hair. The brush/bristles are super nice! No poking, pulling or tangling (I have medium length/fine hair). Definitely adds volume but like most people, I expected a little more! LOL Great buy for the price and I imagine it will be wonderful when traveling as I wont need to pack a hair dryer, round brush and flat iron! Hoping Revlon comes out with an improved model that is lighter as I think those with limited upper body strength will find this unit too heavy!",4,3,B01LSUQSB0
"This was working really well when I first started using it. I have super thick hair and it was getting through it and drying and a good rate, then after about 10 minutes of use, it started getting REALLY hot. My head started feeling on fire and my fingers that were holding the tip for stability and control were bright red and there was no way I could touch that part anymore. I set it down for 30 minutes, then came back to try again ( the cool option doesn't work for me, it would take 2x as long to get done) and after 10 minutes, it was scorchingly hot again.
I also found the handle quite unwieldy. I'm returning it and sticking with my regular straightener.
I don't recommend this product.",1,3,B01LSUQSB0
"I bought this thinking it will be the best dryer ever... didn't meet my expectations. I have extensions so it might make it a little different. I have to use my hair dryer before using this because it would take forever to dry my hair. Not only that but it has HOT COOL and LOW setting. So... the HOT setting feels like it'll break and damage your hair because the temperature is way to hot but that's the only setting that will dry it at a regular type of pace. COOL has the same drying speed but does nothing for my hair when its cold. LOW speed dries it so slow but has a regular temperature to it. The product itself is heavy, sounds and smells cheap like a normal store product I used to buy as a teenager. (No offense to anyone but im just used to buying stuff that's a little more expensive but lasts a lot longer)
Since I do have extensions its hard to get the volume I want just with this hairdryer as well. its heavy and hurts my hand after a while.
A positive note... I have noticed my hair comes out smooth with the help of this dryer. I also have noticed that when my friends who do not have extensions use it, it comes out amazing and has volume and is smooth as well. Not sure what setting they use but I don't suggest using that hot setting as it seems wayyy too hot. Worth it to try and see how it works on your hair!",4,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my daughter. The box was a disheveled mess...like something you’d find at a flea market. Definitely looked like a return. There was no packing within the box and therefore, bounced all over the place. I figured I best try it since it looks like a return. The product hardly blew any air, and what’s worse is it had a bad smell to it. I am very u happy with this purchase. I thought better of things from Amazon, but there is no way this product was not used, or returned etc. I wouldn’t give this box as a present to anyone either.",1,3,B01LSUQSB0
"Super mixed review because it smoked up the entire bathroom within 2 minutes. Smoke, not steam. My hair looked awesome, but started getting a little wavy within 15 minutes. Gave it another go.. smoked up again.. but this time my hair stayed the entire day, with great volume! Tried it again a few days later, and it smoked up even more, so I had to return it. I hear a lot of them smoke up but mine must have been superrr defective. Easy to get a refund. I then ordered the hot tools one.. big mistake, that one leaves my hair wavy wavyyyyy within 5 minuts, not even a third go around worked. And my hair isnt even that wavy! Moral of story, if you dont get a defective one, I think you’ll really like this one lol.",3,One,B01LSUQSB0
"The first hairdryer my daughters have been able to use themselves to straighten their naturally curly hair. They were amazed at the results. They were 13 and 15 when they first tried it. They even fought over who could take it to summer camp this year.....so they are getting a second one for Christmas! I have recommended to other friends that have been happy with the results as well. Makes blowdrying hair so much easier!
My oldest has long, thick, curly hair and can get her hair straight by using this. She then just has to touch up with a flat iron to get it stick-straight. My youngest has long, thin, curly hair and has the same results, with just less drying time. They said it can get hot, but it is not too heavy for them to use.
Highly recommend!!!",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"First off, I was shocked at how LOUD this thing is, even on low setting. Like potential hearing loss if you regularly use this thing right by your ears. Anyway, I bought this after seeing so many ads for similar products and being reminded of a similar product I had as a teenager and loved. That one rotated though, this one does not rotate. I have curly, thick hair. I was hoping to get hair that was straight but had more volume than when I straighten with a flat iron, without as much damage, and a more natural look than a flat iron gives. The end result for me, even being very careful and patient and doing small sections, was less than desired. It will definitely need to be touched up with a flat iron, especially around the roots and around my face. I have spent my entire life practicing different ways to blow out and straighten my hair, I would consider myself a bit of an expert, and leaving slight curl at the root is a dead giveaway for curly hair that was poorly straightened. The texture was not that smooth, even after going over it with the cool setting at the end. Definitely had more volume than flat ironing but not as much as I expected, even with pulling the sections up as I was drying. Add to it that I was sweating so badly by the end of this labor intensive process that the hair around my neck was completely curly again and I was in need of a second shower. I had to immediately put my hair up to avoid heat stroke by the end, which defeats the purpose. I would not buy this again. I will stick with my babyliss hair dryer and flat iron and use a curling iron for ends and root volume. Time wise I would say it was similar but mentally by about half way through I was so over this, which I don’t experience when flat ironing.",3,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I really liked this brush because I have long, wavy hair, which usually dries easily but I am not really good with the brush and conventional dryer style. This brush is very convenient. It left my hair smooth and shiny super fast. I do want to point out that this brush is not for ""drying"" your hair, it is more for styling, reducing frizz, and leaving your hair really smooth and manageable. The reason I say this is because: 1) the brush is big so that it's not good for drying your roots, otherwise you might burn your hair up there and get a bunch of baby hairs; 2) this tool really gets hot within 5-6 minutes so the less time you spend with it on the high hot temperature, the better. Because of this, I blow dry my hair up to 90%, specifically the roots and top-mid hair, not necessarily the bottom half of my hair. I also switch to cool temperature when I have been using the brush for a while and it gets really hot because usually it takes like 1-2 minutes for the air to get cool, so this kind of balances the temperature.

RECOMMENDATION FOR FUTURE MODIFICATIONS FOR THIS BRUSH:
1) It would be great if the brush had a mid-high hot temperature option since the brush can get really hot 10-15 min in. However, I do also want to mention that every single dryer brush I have seen only has the same temperature options as this one: cool, low, and high.
2) THIS ONE IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME AND i THINK IT WOULD BE SUPER EASY TO DO: It would be great if the cool tip was longer for better grip.

OVERALL, THOUGH, I THINK THAT THIS BRUSH IS REALLY CONVENIENT AND EASY TO USE. JUST BE CAREFUL WITH THE HOT TEMPERATURE (AS IT IS FOR ANY OTHER HOT TOOL) AND REMEMBER TO ALWAYS ROLL THE BRUSH INTO YOUR HAIR. IT IS NOT A STRAIGHTENER SO DON'T JUST PASS IT DOWN YOUR HAIR. THE BRUSH IS BIG BUT LIGHTWEIGHT!
*Also, I know some people say that their brush came with hairs, indicating that it was already used, or that it got on fire lol (I saw one review saying this)... mine was super clean and I always place it away from water to avoid any electrical/fire hazards. I usually do my hair in the bathroom but I have a basket with dry towels where I can place it!",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I really wanted to love this dryer, but it just didn't love me back. Unfortunately, the ions that perfect most hair aren't suitable for fine hair. It's been a few years since I've attempted an ionic dryer and I started to think, well, maybe it's all in my head. Maybe the ions are more of a marketing gimmick and don't really do anything. Everyone I know who uses this dryer has gorgeous, bouncy hair and loves the ease of the tool. I'm here to say it's just not a good option if you have fine hair. I used this every day for a month under a variety of circumstances - humid rainy days, dry/low humidity sunny days, days with normal conditioner applied, days with less conditioner, sometimes with a root lifter and/or mousse, sometimes without, etc. The time I saved drying my hair, plus a good bit more, was spent trying to actually invoke a little lift and life into my hair. It was beyond flat. Yes, it was super shiny, but geez, it was stuck to my head flat and slick. Not greasy slick, but the kind of soft, limp and slick hair that struggles to hold a ponytail holder. So I'm back to my former life using a non-ionic dryer and boar bristle brush and my hair looks good. It's not quite as easy as this tool, but at least I'm saving time on styling. And my mom was really happy to have an early Mother's day gift.",2,4,B01LSUQSB0
"This thing is the bomb.com! Seriously, I haven't touched my hair dryer since I got it four months ago. My hair has never been healthier or looked better. I don't have to use a straightener after blow drying it like I used to with a round brush. It looks like I have gotten a blow out every time!

Con: there's only cool-low-high temperature settings. The low is too low and the high is REAL hot. Like burn your face or hand hot. I wish there was a medium, but I've made the high work for me by following the same rules you do with a regular blow dryer and not using it until my hair is 80% dry and using a heat protectant.

Maybe the high heat is what gets my hair looking so good? Who knows! But on the plus side I don't use a straightener so it cuts down on the heat I'm putting in my hair and I have less split ends and frizz than ever before. Plus it takes half the time and looks better!

All and all I could not recommend this product enough. It saves time and I *personally* believe it is better for my hair because it's never looked or felt better. It's work every dang penny!",5,2,B01LSUQSB0
"I really didn't know how to rate it. Had product one month. Used basically daily. Super convenient, saves me time and energy. I love that. I'm not a huge hair person so this was *really* the product made for me.
Product started making a piercing sharp razor sound, which at first I ignored. I shut it off thinking it got too hot and then for the next week the noise got louder, and the heat was intermittent. It was almost like someone was switching the knob from high to low over and over. I knew it was going out and no longer felt safe using the product due to being afraid it would catch on fire. One month surpassed my time window to return to Amazon, so I contacted the company. Within a very short period of time they returned my email, and they are sending me a brand new dryer at no cost due to the product being under warranty. If you go down this road keep the card and box it comes in just in case so you have all the information for the company for warranty purposes. Here's to *hoping* they follow through with their promise and send me the product within the week.",1,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Was really enjoying this product for a few months until one evening ... prior to this episode I did notice that gradually the bristles started bending/softening with increased use. One evening I was blowing out my hair and out of no where the product started sparking, a spark flew onto my face and missed my eye by centimeters. I immediately turned it off and noticed that in that short period of time nearly half the bristles had MELTED. This is a really dangerous product. I came to search on amazon if anyone else has any similar issues and come to find out that the product being sold now is a newer and improved model than the one I purchased less than just a year ago I WONDER WHY. Do NOT recommend this damaged my hair and sparks flying from this blow dryer nearly
Blinded me. Interestingly enough for some reason I do not currently see an option to add pictures that I have of the melted bristles to this review.",1,One,B01LSUQSB0
"The last time I went to get my hair cut, my stylist had just gotten one of these dryers because she said she wanted to play with it, and used it to do my blow out. I liked the results she was able to achieve, and crossed my fingers that it would finally let me make my own hair look as nice as she always does (usually with a round brush and conventional blow dryer).

This dryer is great for creating a ""salon blowout"" without the awkwardness of trying to manipulate two separate tools. Any time I tried to mimic my stylist's technique and use my regular hair dryer and a round brush, my arms would be fatigued by the end, and I would pretty much give up. Because this is two tools in one, it can be switched back and forth to give the ""working"" arm a chance to rest, which works perfecly for me.

The brush is larger than I expected it to be, which means does a great job of creating the blowout look, but it's a bit too big to fully replace a curling iron (4.25"" is bigger than it might sound). My expectation was that it would do both, and if I had longer hair (mine just touches my shoulders), it might. However, the dryer can be used to ""pre style"" hair to create an initial shape that can be refined with additional tools, which I've been very pleased with. I have stick-straight hair, so even if I haven't left enough time to finish it with a curling iron, I can still get the salon smooth look with a bit of shape to it. And to be fair, the product description emphasizes that its use is primarily to smooth and add volume, which it absolutely does.

The one caveat I would offer is to those concerned about possible damage from hot styling tools. Even the ""low"" setting is pretty hot, and there's nothing between ""cool"" (no heat) and ""low."" For someone with a very sensitive scalp, or hair that's already damaged, or weak from chemical processing, I would set the expectation that they may need to use the ""cool"" setting exclusively, which could increase drying time.

Overall, this dryer has completely replaced my conventional blow dryer, and I've been very pleased with the way it smooths my hair, gives it some volume, and can be used to add shape that either contributes to a successful finished look when styled with other tools, or just adds a little polish to a plain blow out.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I purchased this dryer because of the reviews I’ve read. Was looking for a way to dry my thin but very full head of hair. I have fibromyalgia and arthritis so it hard to hold my arms up to dry my combination straight and curly hair. My hair is styled in a bob but still takes more time to smooth the curl out and dry it. This styling tool is terrific! Light enough so my arms don’t get tired and the drying time is just a few minutes. After towel drying and product application I section off hair and starting at the bottom it doesn’t take more than two curls of the brush to dry and smooth out my curl. Leaves my hair smooth and soft quickly. My hairstylest asked me to bring it with my on my next appointment so he could check it out, which I did today. He was very impressed with the speed of drying but did caution against using the high heat setting. I do use the lower setting as recommended for thinner hair. I really hated going out with wet hair and the natural look isn’t a good one fo my hair! Now in just a few minutes my hair looks great and my arms don’t hurt....a win-win situation for me!",5,4,B01LSUQSB0
"I used this dryer maybe 8 times in three months and it burned out. Sparks, smoke, the works. I have never had a hair tool stop working in such a short amount of time. I contacted the maker (Helen of Troy) for a warranty claim/replacement via email and they asked for more information. When I sent the information, I didn't hear anything back from them. I am very disappointed with this purchase and the lack of customer service I received from Helen of Troy If you give someone a detective product, you should at least honor your warranty/service as advertised. I know there is a lot of good hype surrounding the Revlon One Step but I would advise that anyone think twice before buying this product.",1,One,B01LSUQSB0
"Absolutely love this hot air brush. I was so torn on which brand that I wanted to buy and after I narrowed it down to revlon, I didn’t know which product from revlon that I wanted. I’m glad I chose this one. It is a little larger than I expected, but it was still light and super easy to use. My hair is thick and I have layers...it only took me 15 minutes to dry and style my hair. To say I’m impressed is an understatement. I did let my hair dry about 50-75% before using it and I definitely recommend still using a heat protectant. I have always been obsessed with salon blowouts, but I most likely will never pay for another one. This brush is amazing! If you’re hesitating on which brand/product to buy, I can tell you I have no regrets purchasing this.",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I wanted to love this product. Yes it dried my very thick hair in record time but it runs WAY to hot my hair was getting fried, after drying I look down and my clothes were covered in broken damaged hair and my hair looked frizzy and bad, by the time I had actually used the product it was too late to return it",1,6,B01LSUQSB0
"Just not for me. Had high hopes with all the great reviews.

My hair type- I have very long (mid rib cage) length hair, it is very fine and naturally straight but no volume. A gust of wind makes my hair a knot it's so fine. I have a lot of hair it's just thin.

My routine- I always just blow dry my hair upside down with a brush and it turns out just fine (gives some volume), maybe straighten the dead ends a tiny tiny bit after. And i like it.
But thought I'd try this and see if it's as amazing as everyone says.

Disliked-I didn't like how loud it was first of all my goodness (especially with a sleeping baby in the next room). I honestly have NO clue how to use it or where to start with my hair. I don't like the fine bristles in the brush it made my hair very poofy/frizzyish. I feel like it gave my roots much less volume than blow drying it upside down does. I tried the blowout look on the ends with it but I could do that much easier with a rounded edge flat iron.

I guess it does dry fast but that's due to the high heat which I feel will just damage my hair after a while.",3,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Ok, so this thing is AWESOME!!! I have SUPER THICK, naturally curly, frizzball hair think bad 1980's perm...if I go to bed with wet hair, I wake up with wet hair...no way I could ever take a shower before we needed to go somewhere...HOURS to just try and mess with this hair...unfun!!! I ordered this not expecting miracles but THAT is what I got!!!! Left my freshly washed hair up in my microfiber towel for a bit then decided to test it out...slathered on my leave in conditioner and spritzed on my heat protectant..I sectioned this mess of hair and off we went. Lemme tell ya, I am used to blow drying then using my big curling iron and flat iron...😒...I did the bottom section with this and was instantly mad that NO ONE I know told me about this, I mean, that it works so well!!!.my hair was dry (even at the root) and SILKY, shiny and soft...WHY DIDNT I BUY THIS SOONER???!!! My hair is out the door ready is 1/4 of the time...and I didn't have to heat up a curling iron and flat iron...WIN!!!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I really wanted to like this hair dryer, but it is just way too loud and it hurt my ears to use it! In fact, I can't believe it meets hearing standards.

I actually had to wear my foam ear plugs that I use on the firing range in order to use it. I just didn't think it was worth the hassle to pay that much money and not be totally happy with it so I returned it after one use. I also thought it took longer to dry my hair with this hair dryer than using my old one with a round brush. Additionally, if you're not careful when you go to hold the other end while trying to style with it, you'll burn your fingers.",2,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I finally gave in to buying this, and it was kind of blah moment for me. I thought this would be an easy fast way to get salon blow out. I’ve followed directions as it stated and it just didn’t wow me. It’s definitely a learning curve to it. It’s not as easy as just taking sections of your hair and brushing it while getting a salon blow out. Yes it does dry your hair while brushed but honestly I’ve purchased a knock off brand of this and it works better and fraction of the price. It takes time, which I didn’t care for as I’m a mom and don’t have that time to be fixing my hair. I also have short hair that’s wavy naturally with some frizz and I would still go in with a straight iron. Another thing I must mention it’s heavy and not easy to hold or move around. It also sheds your hair and My hair doesn’t shed when I blow dry my hair with a comb and blow dryer. It’s not worth the price either. I’ll stick to my instyler that I’ve had for years that has worked for me. Be careful because I found it thinned my hair and lots of breakage. I’m not a fan.",2,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I adore this hair tool. I used it for the first time on Sunday. I sectioned my hair into 2 quadrants of 8 starting at the back, and used the lo-setting as it is warm enough. The secret is sectioning your hair and letting your hair air-dry 70% while doing your skin care prep or makeup application before using this tool, the same as you would when blowing out your hair. There are two reasons for this: the heat in such close proximity to your hair will cause it to burn if you have it on the high setting for too long, and prolonged stress and heat on the motor will cause it to blow. I let my hair 70% dry then used the lo setting, brushing and turning the barrel with the hair being pulled upwards. I finish each section by running the dryer through my hair on the cool setting. Each individual strand is dry, shiny, and smooth. It sounds like a lot of work doing it this way, but it expedites the drying process. I never get compliments on my hair, and I usually don't spend much time on it, to be honest. However, after using this blow dryer, 3 people commented favorably on my hair styling while I was out on a quick errand. Aw :-) I didn't notice if it created any more volume than a traditional blow dryer, but then again, that depends on technique. Tonight after work I'll have to play with it some more. I don't get excited about new products often, but I can't wait to use this again.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Let me start off by saying I have ridiculously curly frizzy thick hair. I get my hair chemically straightened every 3 to 4 months and still have to flat iron it - so I was very intrigued with this.
1st of all it is large and slightly difficult to handle until you get comfortable with it.. it does get very hot- so be careful where you put your hands.
It did dry my hair very well and relatively easily, but did not straighten it as much as I had hoped. It was definitely straighter than if I had just let it dry naturally but not as much with a flat iron or straightening brush.
However since it straightened some it took me less than 5 minutes to finish it with a straightening brush- vs 30 + normally

Pros
Dries hair quickly and effectively
Does straighten it some
Gets very warm even on lower setting
Has 3 different heat/blower settings

Cons
Doesn't straighten as much as I hoped
Have to be careful where you put your hands - it does get uncomfortably hot in places
Very loud",4,0,B01LSUQSB0
"The product I received wasn’t what is shown in the pictures. It doesn’t say Revlon on it anywhere. It took 3 months to arrive. The product doesn’t work, it doesn’t even turn on. The seller will not issue a refund and refused to allow a return.",1,4,B01LSUQSB0
"So sad and disappointed. Have tried two of these now. First one died about one minute into use and emitted a burn/chemical smell. Tried the safety breakers, totally dead. I thought darn, must have been a fluke, so I ordered a replacement. It came quickly which was nice, however it too died. The second one lasted about 10 minutes, mostly on Low, and then died and let out little whiffs of smoke. Again, safety breakers not to blame. I’d be willing to bet these came from the same production batch. Better quality control needed for sure. Some internal part should be recalled.",1,2,B01LSUQSB0
"I had such high hopes for this hairdryer after my friend excitedly sent me the link and said it was amazing. I couldn’t wait for it to arrive. I have had multiple spinal fusions and have some nerve damage in my arms which makes using my blow dryer and brush simultaneously a trick at times. I thought I had found the perfect solution. Nope. So, clearly there are some great reviews but there are a SUBSTANTIAL number of reviewers who had the exact same issue as me..... though I think I win the contest for how quickly my new dryer quit. Literally, the FIRST time I tried to use it today, within a minute at most, it made a weird high pitch sound and then the speed dropped. I am now unable to get two of the settings to work and what’s even scarier is how HOT this tool became within just seconds! There is CLEARLY a design flaw and/or quality control issues! I am really disappointed to say the least. This is not an inexpensive tool and so many customers have had it quit on them as well but many were after the 30 day return window. What’s up with that anyway? It makes me think that Revlon knows they have a faulty appliance on the market. The first thing they tried to do was force me to talk to someone in tech control which I also find very interesting. This is a good idea as far as a blow-dry tool, but this one is scary because it gets WAY TOO HOT and will fry your hair if it doesn’t catch on fire first, or quit on you altogether like it did me on my very first use. The instructions mention this issue and blame it on the vent being blocked which mine was not, and then instruct the consumer to unplug and let cool so that the appliance will “reset”. Mine did not reset. It’s alarming that it’s designed in such a way that this is such an issue. I find this alarming. This is how fires start and besides, who wants to dry their hair with a tool that gets this hot? Fried hair anyone? 😡",1,One,B01LSUQSB0
"Update: Lowered rating from 2 stars to 1 star. I tried to give it another try, and after a couple of uses, it just quit working. Reset button doesn’t fix it. Won’t turn on at all. I bought it less than a year ago.

My hair is very fine and a mix of 3A and 3B curls, though I’ve worn it mostly straight using a traditional blow dryer and straightener for well over a decade. I decided to give this a shot based on the reviews, and I used it for about 6 months. While I really loved how it streamlined the process and gave me good volume that looked smooth at first, it came at a long term cost. My hair gradually became more and more damaged as I used it. It has ultimately fried my hair - no matter how much heat protectant - and snapped it in half all over due to the tugging bristles and very hot plates. Perhaps it’s user error by using it on too high of heat or on too wet of hair, but it’s going to take a long time for my hair to recover from this device, which is a shame because it really did make for beautiful blowouts.",1,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Best product I have ever had!!! I did not believe when I bought this all the reviews that were so happy to purchase this but once I tried it I fell in love. I have never blown dried my hair and left my hair looking perfect I would always tangle the brush and give up ending up straightening my hair with a flat iron which had damage my hair. It took me about an hour to blow dry my hair and then use the straightener now it takes me 15 min and I’m done! It’s easy to use my hair is straight but difficult sometimes, it’s about shoulder length. I noticed a burning smell the first time I used it but haven’t smelled any since. It has two hot air setting and one cold setting. It is very strong, sounds like a regular hair dryer. I love it never thought I’d be able to have a full blow dry hairdo. It cools down quick, the only negative is if you have short hair it might be a bit more difficult to use because of its big size and if you have super small hands you’ll get tired of holding it quick.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Okay so I was debated a while if I should had even bought one of these. So I decided why not let’s see if it works. First of all it’s easy to maneuver the handle is a bit big but wasn’t a hassle. Second it does get real hot so I used it on the low setting and I didn’t use it when my hair was real wet I let it air dry for a bit before using it. It can burn your scalp if u put it too close so I tried leaving some space between my roots. Third I’m not a big fan of blow drying my hair but I wanted to see how much time I can utilize using this styling tool. As you can see the results on the left hand side it still left it frizzy and I had to pass my straightener even after using the volumizer.
Overall it’s real fast saves u time but I’m guessing since I have short hair and a lot of hair it just didn’t give me the results I was hoping for. I still needed to use my flat iron. Maybe if my hair was longer it would work better. I ended up returning it. I’ll purchase it again and try it once my hair grows longer.",3,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Going to try to keep this short and simple.. As others have stated before... Just buy it. It really is that good. It is good bc it covers a LARGE surface area (meaning half the dry time), has a nice shape to create lift, flip and curl, gets HOT (get heat protect) and you dont need to use a round brush AND a blow dryer.

If you are a mom, buy this. Right now. My hair was thrown up after my shower yesterday afternoon. I have ramen noodle type curl to my hair and if its thrown up messily, its WILD. It was partially dried but mainly still damp. My daughter went downstairs to eat a banana with her daddy and I think I was finished my hair within 5 minutes.

Moms, buy this. Instead of a long blow dry sesh ( and I have a good blow dryer that is quick), get this.. Don't let your family know how great it is. send kids with dad.. lock yourself in your bathroom, bedroom, closet- wherever. Spend a few minutes doing your hair, then spend the rest of your free time reading your favorite book, scrolling social media, and eating your favorite snack. I would just suggest to occasionally still run the blow dryer to thwart off dads/kids who are likely scratching at your door for you to be done.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Bien por el vendedor el paquete llegó antes de la fecha. En cuanto al cepillo, hace lo que dice que hace. Es fácil secar el pelo y lo hace rápido. Mi peli no es súper lacio pero igual lo seca bien, mi recomendación es que dejes secar tu pelo al aire libre en un 80% y luego lo utilices, es más fácil que si te lo secas un poco con una toalla ( Ali he hecho de las dos maneras y me llevo menos esfuerzo dejándolo al aire libre). Todo perfecto hasta ahí, pero el cepillo es un poco grande para llegar hasta el tronco así que el pelo me queda lacio y bonito casi completo, excepto la raíz y mi flequillo. Si tienes pelo lacio no creo tengas dificultad con esto y si no se puede optar por una mini plancha para la raíz y flequillos. Igual le doy 5 estrellas porque en general funciona bien, no he tenido ningún problema hasta ahora para usarlo, es fácil y no pesa como para que luego te duela el brazo.",5,3,B01LSUQSB0
"Update- I've tried this on my straight/wavy hair and the results were smooth and gorgeous BUT it severely dried out and damaged my ends. I'm 100% returning. You will not notice the damage untill you stop using it because it will smooth out and mask the damage at first. I need to cut my hair now.
Original review-If anyone is wondering if this works on ethic or biracial hair I'm here to tell you it does not. My daughter is biracial with thin but curly hair. I dried it section by section on the hot setting. It dried really good but I was hoping it would straighten it so we could skip the flat iorn. It straightened it but it became puffy or ""fluffy"" after an hour and then waves started forming. This is best for white people type hair who want a one step process. This is good to dry biracial hair and to pre straighten it but you will definitely have to use a flat iorn still. I gave it 2 stars because it worked but it didn't smooth or straighten enough to use as a single process. Also its HUGE and the handle is thick so its definitely not the easiest to hold on to or maneuver because it's so big. Its definitely a highly overrated product that I'm returning.",2,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I have chin to shoulder-length curly hair, 2c-3b (depending on how it feels that day). I haven't ever used a hair dryer before. I have only used this product two times and all I have to say is WOW. It is so simple to use and intuitive to handle, just like a blowout brush a stylist would use at a salon. My hair looks great! It leaves me with a sleek and voluminous look in 10-15 minutes; I don't even have to section my hair.

The two things you should know:

1. It's BIG. The barrel, the handle, everything is bulky. The shorter your hair, the more difficult it will be to use. I hope further models come out with something that has size-interchanging brush heads!

2. It gets really hot, and there's only three settings: High/Hot, Low, and Cool. Maybe I'm just unused to the struggle of sweating under the heat of hair dryers, but it really warms up.",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"This product is great, especially given its low price. I have always wanted to style my hair better, but never had much luck given the time and energy it takes to style well with a regular blow dryer and round brush. The one-step offers a quick and easy way to get a quality blowout.
This product is best used on almost-dry hair. I usually let my hair air dry or towel dry most of the way first. I find that it takes longer and is less effective to use the one step on wetter hair. For a very quick cleanup, i just run the brush through my hair multiple times as if I were brushing my hair normally. However if you want to achieve more of a salon-style look, I would recommend sectioning hair off and running the brush through one piece at a time, curling the hair under the brush as you work through. I get many compliments when I do this, and even using the quicker method I find that my hair is softer and less frizzy throughout the day.
Just a heads up, since this is a brush it does require regular cleaning. I find it can be cleaned just as a brush can, using a comb to pick hair out of the bristles.",5,2,B01LSUQSB0
"I hate my hair. It's one of the few things I honestly regret inheriting from my grandmother (and she wore a wig for most of her life). My hair is thin, fine, and completely does whatever it wants no matter how much I compel it to listen to how I want it styled. Of course the double whammy is that I want my hair to be straight, not wavy, and have some sort of volume. I've used other products in the past such as straighteners, flat straightening brushes, straightening shampoos, volume shampoos, and deep conditioners to no avail. This is the first thing I've bought that has not only tamed my hair into submission, but also added volume. I've used it in two ways so far: I've let my hair air dry slightly and then used it to dry/straighten, and I've also used it straight from the shower after towel drying first. While both ways have been effective for styling, using it after towel drying without letting it air dry to any degree provided a result that was amazing. I can't wait to continue using this product!",5,5,B01LSUQSB0
"This is by far one of the best items that I have purchased based on reviews and promotions of a product. I have curly hair that even with the best blow dryer and flat iron, there are moments just when my hand starts to get tired that I have a few little bumps and grooves left after drying my hair. This brush left my hair completely strategy from root to end. The temperature was a bit hot for me at times, but at this time, I do have medium left hair and could feel the heat a bit more on my scalp, but it is not that hot that it can burn your scalp. This brush literally cuts at a minimum 40% of normal drying time that with a regular blow dryer. I was a bit concerned with the bristle type of the brush as this does affect the drying depending on the texture of your hair. Had no issues with the look nor quality of my hair once it was blown out.

Do be aware that though you don't smell heat, you will be able to see some smoke like fog in the air of your room. I blew out my hair in a fairly big bedroom, and as I looked around, I felt as if I was in a crowded hair salon on a mid Saturday afternoon in Uptown New York. Aside from this, overall the product felt good on my hair. Didn't feel it burnt, stiff, nor had frizz. I did use Cantu Thermal Shield protector before drying the hair. Great results after I finished and the following day after using it my hair looks and feels great. Highly recommend it. May purchase another one just for my travel needs.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Okay, so if you’re anything like me, you have the toughest time giving yourself a blowout with a traditional dryer and round brush.

My arms get way too tired, I can’t seem to roll the brush around while I’m trying to work the blow dryer, and it comes out looking like a disaster that I have to fix with a straighter.

I GAVE UP blow drying my hair altogether unless I was getting my hair colored at a salon, so at least I could request they do it for me.

This dryer is a game changer. It’s easy to use, since you’re handing one tool instead of two. You can use both hands to twirl it and bump those ends!
It doesn’t get too hot, and it dries the sections fairly quickly. I think I go over each section 3 times on average. Once really quickly to dry, then the next two I rotate the brush as I go down the strand.
I am so happy I purchased this dryer! It’s honestly the best purchase I’ve made for my hair.

The photos I attached are: wet hair, natural hair, and then my hair after using this dryer.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I was really excited to try this after reading all the reviews. I was nervous because I have extremely thick, curly (2c/3a) hair. But I saw other peoples photos with curly hair and I was convinced.

I would say this product is mediocre--at best--for thick, coarse, or curly hair. I showered the night before and put my hair up so it would be mostly dry by morning. It STILL took me an hour and a half to dry and style with this thing. Whereas straightening my hair takes 45 mins, tops. So it definitely doesn't save me time.

The lack of temperature control should be something Revlon considers fixing in a future model but I was aware of the settings when I purchased. The low and cool settings did absolutely nothing on my hair so I had to use it on high the entire time. No biggie, I have healthy hair and use a heat protectant but the noise it makes when it's on high or cool is unbearable. It's so loud, but not just that, it has this metallic ringing. 2 hours later and I'm still hearing it.

It is also EXHAUSTING. LOL Maybe I'm not used to it because I never give myself blowouts but DANG! My arms hurt after using this thing. It is a bicep workout!

I will say though, my hair looked fabulous by the time I finished. Very voluminous and like the perfect Rachel Green-esque blowout. I would have posted pictures but it rained on my way to work and all my hard work was ruined :(

I won't be returning but will probably not use this to style my full head in the future. I'll probably straighten the bottom half and use this for the top so I can get that volume and bounce.

TLDR: Great if you have fine and/or straight hair... Not so much for thick, coarse or curly. Takes longer than just straightening (not a time saver at all) but look amaze. A perfectly mediocre product worthy of its 3 stars.",3,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I absolutely LOVE this! I have thick, curly and frizzy hair and this completely dries it, straightens it and smooth it all in one!! I am mind blown. I used to.have to spend about 20 jingles drying my hair layer by layer and then use a straitener to smooth everything out for another 15 minutes. This takes me under 20 minutes and I'm done! And the volume it gives your hair is amazing. I dont care if you already own every hair tool there is, you need this one. You will never use another!! Was this review helpful? Please say so and follow me on FB at The Real Housewife of 815!",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"Update: after using it once a week for about a month, HORRIBLE high pitch noise when it's on the cool setting. Its so high that my dog ran away from the other room and my husband came flying in the bathroom thinking something was broken.

I was very skeptical getting this because I do not blow dry my hair. I have thick, long(middle of my back) course, wavy, frizzy hair. I typically give up blow drying halfway through my head because it takes me an hour. My sister in-law recommended it, and her hair is even longer than mine(waist length). I LOVE IT! Big game changer! I've been getting compliments since I've been using it, people thinking I have been going to the salon to get blowouts, took me 30 minutes to dry and I don't even have to stop halfway to ""cool down"". It is a bit big and clunky, have to get used to it. I watched a few videos on how to use it, setting up your hair and I did dam good the first time. I really wish I did a before an after picture, but after using it, there will never be a before!",3,2,B01LSUQSB0
"When I first purchased this a few months ago (3months ago) I was in love with it. I have thick curly hair and this product literally saved me a whole hour and so on my hair routine! I started seeing that my hair was thinning out a lot and it got to the point where people asked if I got a haircut because my hair seemed shorter. I miss my long hair. And yes, the finish product after using this would leave my hair feeling so soft and after a while I noticed my hair seaming fried when I tried to style it. I would use this 3 days out of the week and it wasn’t until now that it completely burned out on me. I smelled like something was burning so I turned it off and when I turned it back on the handle was extremely hot. Really scared me and then I came to read the reveries to see if other experienced the same and I just wish I would of read all of the reviewers before putting my hair through all of this.",1,2,B01LSUQSB0
"I was so excited to get this blow dryer. I had my eye on it for weeks and then I decided to order it despite a lot of negative reviews. Well, the negative reviews were right. First off, I was supposed to receive this item the same day I ordered it thanks to Prime, but of course it didn’t come since Lasership screwed up like they always do and decided not to leave my package and tell lie after lie and excuse after excuse. Amazon customer service was terribly unhelpful and wasted an hour of my time on the phone only to aggravate me even more. The blow dryer showed up the next day and I tested it out immediately and I was not happy. This blow dryer is terrible, a total waste of money. It’s bulky and not easy to use at all. It’s a lot heavier than you’d think and the picture makes it look smaller. It made my hair look horribly frizzy and it looked nothing like the pictures other people posted which makes me believe a lot of the good reviews are FAKE. Do not buy this blow dryer if you’re looking for an easier alternative because you’ll just be disappointed and you’ll be mad about wasting money. This blow dryer should cost $10 and be sold at the dollar store. I will be returning this piece of junk. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!",1,One,B01LSUQSB0
"So, this is like a draft of what one-piece dryer/stylers will be in 5 years. But it's a good first attempt to mass market a very effective tool. Heavy. LOUD.

This has has cut my drying and styling time by more than half (straight plain hair, no product,, long layers, sits a tad on my shoulders), which is huge.

There is a functional knob on the end opposite the hand grip, so with two hands, the weight of this can be comfortably distributed as you style.

The oval brush head is very helpful in turning bangs and ends under, but you will not get curling iron action from this device.

I wear ear plugs because at its highest speed, the noise is well beyond 85dB.

Temp control is minimal, but who needs more than cool, low, and high, anyway? The cool and low are both the same speed/force and are handy for touch ups. The high heat/ high speed is a single function. It's hot and it's powerful.. and loud.",4,0,B01LSUQSB0
"If I would have written this review on October 23, 2020. I would have given the revlon one step hair dryer 5 stars. Unfortunately, this is being written on December 20, 2020 and it is receiving 1 star.

On December 1 (yes, I documented this) I mentioned to my husband my hair looked thinner. I told him I think my new dryer is breaking my hair. He mocked me saying “it’s the best thing ever!” Guess how many times he heard that?! On December 14, my husband walked up behind me and said “baby your hair is so thin.” I started crying.

Prior to the Revlon hair brush dryer I used a hair dryer and flat iron on my hair Monday thru Thursday. Friday thru Sunday I let it air dry. I did the same exact regimen with the Revlon product and now my hair is broken and fried.

The shape of the handle and the tip allows me to really get a good grip and some power behind my round brush motion. My hair looks smooth, healthy and voluminous at the crown.

"I was prepared to spend 100+ on a hairdryer that would dry my hair faster and make it less puffy when it dried. I have thick, kind of curly hair and it's alwasy a puff ball when I dry it. Not with this hair dryer! I have been recommending it to all of my friends and might even get one for an xmas gift. It makes brushing/styling while drying a breeze! I have the tangliest hair but the brush runs right through my hair when I dry it (I brush it with a regular brush once of course). It's so big it never gets caught or tangled up in my hair like some brushes do while drying. It's also really fast in comparison to my old hair dryer, which really needed to be replaced. I typically have to spend a lot of time straightening or styling my hair after I dry it, but with this hair dryer, I really only have to spend a couple of mins running through some areas of my curly hair with a straightener to tame it a bit. I highly recommend this hair dryer (especially for people with difficult, thick, tangly, kind of curly hair).",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I bought this with the hopes of giving myself a ""bouncy blowout"" several times per week.
My natural hair is wavy but not too thick.
It dried my hair quickly and it is very easy to use-however I noticed that it did not add much curl to the bottom of my hair no matter how long I rolled it under or held it in place.
It's more of a gentle straightener/smoother.
I get better lift at the roots so it certainly helps with body but I don't get the round bouncy curls at the bottom.
If you're a person who showers every morning this would be a slower process starting with wet hair.
If you shower at bedtime and would like your hair shiny and smoothed out in the morning this is Perfect!
If you would like a bouncy rounded Curl Under at the bottom of your hair you will have to pull out a curling iron or a second hair appliance.
All in all I do like that it makes my hair soft, smooth and shiny.
I Just wanted more bounce on the bottom!
I will continue to use this and I do recommend it.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"This hair dryer is life changing! Before this, straightening my hair meant oodles of damage. My hair is long and only moderately curly, but I’ve got a TON OF IT. Most stylists can’t straighten my hair with a blow-dryer alone. A flat iron is almost always required. Despite 20 years of practice, my skills are no better, lol. Personally - I needed a wet-to-straight iron and that’s horrendous for my hair. Breakage was common and unhealthy, flat, and overworked.
This hair dryer is a welcome reprieve for my hair. My hair has never dried so quickly before! I It used to take 90+ minutes to dry and straighten. Now I simply blow dry my hair and I’m DONE. The entire process takes 20-30 minutes. Afterward, my hair looks BOMBBBB. Since the heat is less direct and more diffused, damage is virtually nonexistent. My hair has grown the longest it’s been in my life using this dryer. It provides beautiful bounce and volume – totally transforms my hair!

1) use a spray to decrease blow-dry timing. I use Revlon Pillow Pr**f; I do not load my hair up with products, as that extends drying time
2) Section your hair and hold in place with clips
3) dry the hair using the Revlon One-Step in sections, starting on the bottom layers; once that layer is dry, proceed up to the next layer
4) use the hottest (high) setting for the bulk of hair drying; change to the cool (high) setting for smoothing
5) use hairspray to set the style.
I have a MUCH more expensive hair dryer ($300) that I bought for myself for fast, smooth drying, but I am having much better success from this tool instead, with great results.",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
No es lo que esperaba me maltrató mi cabello. lo use la primera vez está bien pero luego vi que mi pelo caía como en pesasitos al piso y por lo mismo lo dejé de usar aparte que los diente se ponen horribles el mismo día que lo usas el peor dinero que he dado.,1,7,B01LSUQSB0
"I was so excited for this product!! I have tried it out three times with the same results. The same results that I get with using a nice round brush and using my blow dryer. Some may say with this I am getting a round brush and dryer in one. As other reviewers have noted this is a heavy product, it is. Also, to dry my hair, the dryer needs to be on high and it is very HOT and I need to keep moving through my hair or I will see smoke. And that smoke isn't from product! A lesser setting is just too cool for thick hair. I need two hands on the dryer to pull it through my thick hair and the handle of the dryer is WAY to thick. Makes it hard to hold in my tiny hand and roll it at the same time. After I was done I still needed to run the flat iron through my hair but I have thick, curly and frizzy hair. I find using my round brush with the dryer much easier. If I could return this I would.",1,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Love this! I have fairly dry, coarse hair and have to use the round brush and blow style technique and also a straight iron sometimes to tame the curls an frizz. This was amazing and quick and left my hair with that flippy smooth and shiny salon look! Got lost of compliments like i just went to salon . Its very easy to use and hair doesn't get tangled in it like others I tried years ago and gave up on. I do have to say the tip is not 'cool' its HOT, so be careful...",4,3,B01LSUQSB0
"I am a white woman with a shoulder length bob. My hair is thick and on rainy days, it frizzes - not attractive! I have had to tame it using large hot rollers removing them slowly to kind of straighten., and then touch up with a flat iron. I washed my hair last night and let it dry naturally, so it definitely took on a look of it's own. This cool tool arrived today and I tried it right away on my dry hair to smooth and style. I couldn't believe how easily it handled. I am not the greatest with round brushes, but this one is completely different. I felt like a pro! My hair turned out perfect so I am retiring the old method of taming. I look forward to trying it on wet hair. I am sure I will not be disappointed. It is pouring rain outside today, and yet I am able to sit on my screen porch and come back inside and my hair still looks good! This is the dream hair tool!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I honestly cannot overstate how much I love this hair dryer! My daughter and I have shared a Dyson for over a year, and we like it a lot. But it has started overheating and being a little unreliable, so we were looking for a backup. I read all the crazy positive reviews before I bought this Revlon one-step, but I still had in the back of my mind that it couldn't really be that good. I was wrong!! My daughter and I have both used it. She has thick, long (super model) hair and it comes out bombshell. I have thin, over processed (not super model) hair, and it too has come out bombshell! This is now our number 1 of all time hair dryer and the Dyson is collecting dust. Sorry, Dyson!

Okay, a few details: The Revlon is easy to hold and use. It dries hair very quickly. The dryer does run hot and doesn't really have a temperature control (although it does have high and low and a cool setting). I have burned my hand a few times grabbing the top of the hair dryer incorrectly. The air controls are at the bottom of the handle and you turn that part of the handle to change the air control. This is my only complaint because it makes it difficult to do a ""cool shot"" when styling with the dyer. But that is a very minor issue. If you are thinking of get this Revlon dryer, don't wait! It is actually as good as all the reviews say!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I have tape in extensions and they take forever to dry when I wash my hair - usually 20 or 30 minutes of constant blowdryer use. I was worried that this dryer would pull too hard on the extensions. It was actually pretty easy to use, and dried my hair in half the time I normally take. It made my hair reasonably smooth with a nice bend at the ends and good volume so I didn't have to use any other heat tools after, which is a huge benefit. The things I didn't love were that it was pretty loud, the high setting does get fairly hot, (I had to switch back and forth between high and low), and there is no easy way to use the cool setting while you are drying. I would still recommend this though, especially if you have longer hair. I can't see this working well on short hair.",4,2,B01LSUQSB0
"My first hot air brush (Conair) had air flow/heat as weak as my hope of getting that ""Salon Sleek and Shiny look on my own. Back to blow-dryer and round brush.

I vowed to never waste $$ on a hot air brush again. However this Revlon dryer started popping up in articles and reviews across all my screens. I was intrigued but wasn't taking the bait. Right. A bad hair day coupled with wine made smashing that ""Buy It Now"" button irresistible. So much for impulse control. Once sober I expected it'd choke on my hair - fairly thick and 6-8"" below my shoulders.

I was so wrong. Instead this bad boy took my hair from a towel-dried mess to sleek and smooth in about 15 minutes. Skills? If you can plug in, turn on, and brush you're good to go.

I do wish it had a cold shot button instead of having to turn the switch to the cool setting. The positives, i.e., easy to hold, comfortable bristles, and lots of power, far outweigh this minor inconvenience",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Don’t see what all the rave reviews are about, this thing is entirely too big to get anywhere near your roots to dry them. As a black woman with wavy hair this should have worked well but if can’t get to roots than It doesn’t really work. Also can’t really return since they shipped it in the revlon box and not a regular amazon box. So I’m stuck with a $60 product. Sorry I waisted my money.",1,5,B01LSUQSB0
"I've been using this for about 7 weeks and I love it. This is a styling tool, not a hair dryer. I let my hair air dry or blow dry it to damp. Then I finish with the Air Brush. Using it to dry your hair from shower-wet leaves the Air Brush on too long and so it gets too hot. But using it to style my hair it is just perfect! My hair is smooth and shiny, no frizz at all.",5,2,B01LSUQSB0
"I really wanted to love this, but the picture attached shows the bristles that fell out on the first use! I gave it another few days, thinking that maybe it would stop losing bristles but after a week, more than 25 had fallen out. I have shoulder length, not-thick, relatively straight hair that I even brush out with a regular brush before using this dryer brush. If there were short bristle bunches on the flat sides like there is in the curved sides, I probably would have kept it, but at this rate, there won’t be any bristles left on the flat sides within a month. Very disappointed. Processing the return now.",1,2,B01LSUQSB0
"I started to grow my hair because of the pandemic (haven’t had a haircut in over a year), I would use an ionic hair dryer and a heat protectant spray whenever I felt it was necessary to dry my hair. I decided to give this product a try and the first time I used it I fell in love with the volume it gave me. However, I noticed very noticeable frizz. Second time the frizz was more noticeable, now after the third time I noticed my hair looks and feels super fried even when I’m not using it. Now I’m using tons of masks and treatment to try to fix the damage. In the past, like 3 years ago, I went for silver hair, so I had to go through long bleaching sessions, you can imagine how that damaged my hair - this is pretty much what my hair feels like right now :( I I used a heat protectant and didn’t use the brush for long. Maybe my hair isn’t as strong, I don’t know. Be careful.

UPDATE: My hair has continued to break after, this has seriously been the very worst purchase I’ve ever made. I’ve lost so much volume on my hair and now all the time I have fried flyaways. I’m seriously thinking about cutting my hair short because of how bad it is. Two friends of mine got the same product and they’re also having similar issues. Terrible, TERRIBLE product.",1,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I took this monster out of the box and thought no way this is going to work, it's going to tangle my long, fine hair. I gave it a shot and have to say it's brilliant! My hair was not tangled by the brush and it looks gorgeous and my hair never looks gorgeous. Mostly I let it air dry, sometimes I'll use the hair dryer and then I'll use the curling iron if something special is going on (not much of that during this awful pandemic). But this tool shortened my process by one step and my hair honestly looks salon blown. Love it and I highly recommend. This is coming from someone who hates going to the salon and hates doing her hair.",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I have been growing my hair out and the longer it gets the longer it takes me to dry it. I use a hairdryer and a round brush and it takes about 40 minutes. I was thinking about just cutting it all off because I just can't take the time commitment anymore. I am a low maintenance kind of girl and spending more than 20 minutes to get ready for my day is too much time. I saw a post on social media about this brush/dryer and thought I would give it a try. I used mousse, pinned it into about 5 sections and started with my hair about 80% - 90% wet. The first picture is the product I used, the second is my hair before (wet) with mousse and brushed straight, and the final picture is it finished. I LOVE THIS BRUSH/DRYER!!!! It only took 20 minutes to dry and I didn't need to use a flat iron to straighten my bangs and the hair around my face. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone! Absolutely love it!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"If I could give this product 10 stars, I would. I have been heat styling my hair once every other day for the past 12-14 years and for almost all of that time, that entailed drying it with a hair dryer first, then straightening it with a flat iron. I finally ended up buying this product to try after an overwhelming endorsement from a shopping group I belong to and it is a GAME CHANGER. The thing I like the most about it is that it feels like it does significantly less damage to my hair than my usual method of styling. It does a better job turning out fresh looking, bouncy hair in a shorter time than even my best hair day used to be with the hair dryer and straightener. Even my 13 year old daughter, who has very fine, flat hair was able to get some wave and volume using this. We both love it, and she can do it to herself with no trouble. Stop considering it and buy this thing right now.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0

I ordered this and am kicking myswlf I didny make the purchase sooner.

"I have a thick head of hair, so thick that I don’t have the patience to straighten, blow dry or style with a curling iron. I let my hair dry naturally and often braid it or throw it in a pony tail because spending 30 minutes+ styling it with hot tools, nor do I enjoy fumbling around with a brush and a blow dryer. Enter the Revlon all-in-one blow dryer....

- Ease of use: extremely intuitive. Within the first few strokes, I quickly got into a natural rhythm of brushing and curling.

- Remarkably fast: it took 5-10 minutes to completely dry my sopping wet hair with this dryer. First time I used it, I couldn’t stop bragging about how efficient this tool is.

I don’t know why anyone would spend money on a blow dryer knowing that this tool exists in the world. I’m so low maintenance with my hair, and this is an absolute MUST HAVE for anyone as low maintenance as I am. Honestly, you’re foolish for NOT owning this tool given the price and functionality.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I purchased one of these in Sept 2018.... By April it stopped working properly. When I turned it on nothing happened when it was on the Low setting, and when I switched it to High it worked as if it was on Low. There was no way to set the dryer to high.

I contacted the company that makes them, Helen of Troy, and they agreed to swap it for a new one. This was great customer service, the person I spoke to over email made it easy. They had to receive the bad one first, before they shipped the new one so I had to procure my own box, but who doesn't have a ton of amazon boxes lying around the house nowadays.

Fast forward to November and its stopped working properly again. It turns on but while I'm using it it'll start and stop, almost like there's a loose wire somewhere inside the dryer. I'm going to attempt to exchange it again but since its been a year since my first purchase i'm not too sure they'll do it. Either way, I wouldn't purchase this again.",1,One,B01LSUQSB0
"This was difficult for me to review-- it works as described once I got the hang of how to use it. My hair dry time was cut down and I had nice, bouncy volume. I liked that its more lightweight than a blow dryer and I felt more controlled than the traditional round brush in one hand, dryer in the other. The problem was the sound. I don't know if mine had a defect or if they all sound like this, but it was like a piercing whine, not the standard blow dryer motor. It wasn't any louder than my regular blow dryer but I could not handle the whine so close to my ears. I so wanted to love it because it did work really well, but just couldn't handle the motor noise. It wasn't as bad on the low setting, but my hair it so thick, it took forever to dry on that setting, even after air drying most of the way. Oh well.",4,One,B01LSUQSB0
"Why didn’t I ever know about a product like this? I would blow dry my hair, my thick long hair, it would take 30 min. Just to then have to straighten it. But then I went to a hair dresser and got the keratin straightener. Obviously precovid. But then covid hit, and I was back to taking forever to dry my hair. Finally, one day my hair dryer started to stink. Then it stopped working. I was just gonna get another one when this popped up and I said why not give it a shot. It took me 10 minutes to dry my hair. A straightener isn’t necessary for it to look thick and straight. But the hair straightener will help. But this item is amazing. I wish I knew about it years ago. It would save me so much time. It would save my hair from just being thrown up in a messy bun while wet. I love it. But the only downside is since I have thick hair I lose a lot and there’s already so much hair in it after one use. It’s not easy to clean.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0

Tiny puff of smoke and deadly smell of burnt engine after. I claimed a replacement and brushed it off (maybe shipping was rough). My second one is less than one year old and on high, it sounds like an airplane engine in my ear. On low it’s good but I bought the dryer so I didn’t have to spend 2 hours blowing drying my frizzy hair straight so here we are .. on my second one, it’s super loud, waiting for it to spark a flame so I can trash it and be done.

"This product was great for me at first but there was minor problems I faced with it before it completely stopped working.

Pros
-kept my hair from falling out a lot less than when I would use a regular blower
- helped my hair have that healthy look especially my ends
-tool heated up to a decent temperature
- left hair silky smooth with out the need of touch ups with flat iron
-reduced time I spent doing my hair(it’s hard with a toddler so that was a plus)

Cons
-after a while the product started over heating and I wouldn’t use it for extended periods of time
- product was always louder than I hoped but it got even louder when it over heated
-got burned a couple of times due to random sparks and high temp
-my brush died in less than a year and I would only use it once or twice a week

"I made it my mission to have better hair during Quarantine from the COVID-19 pandemic. I have VERY thick hair, and it is very wavy/curly. My goal was to extend my hair wash days, and find something that helped tame my frizz for when I absolutely had to use heat on my hair. I saw tons of reviews on TikTok for this product, and when I saw it go on sale for under $30, I decided to give it a try.

Holy. Crap. Best thing I've bought this year.

My hair, which normally takes 25 minutes to dry in sections with my DryBar blow dryer and a round brush, can be completely dry in 12 minutes. TWELVE. MINUTES. Also in those 12 minutes, I am able to look like I just had a blow out done. My hair feels so light and silky. It's basically frizz-free, and with a smoothing cream and some dry shampoo, I can blow dry it once and it last for days. This is revolutionary.

I've recommended this to several of my thick haired and curly haired friends. I love this product.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I purchased this a little over a week ago, and still can’t believe how well it works. To begin, I’m a 42 year old woman who has had thick, frizzy, naturally curly hair my whole life. Hairstylists marvel at my “gorgeous” hair because it has so much body-well that’s because they can get it to look great with a blowout. When I try to straighten my hair, it has never looked good. It takes me at least 30 minutes to blow dry. I can’t do a blow out. The whole brush and blow drying thing is too complicated for me. After blow drying, I look like a scarecrow who stuck her finger in an outlet. Then I spend another 15-20 minutes trying to straighten it with a flat iron. It is still frizzy and puffy, but by the 2nd day, looks kind of ok.

Enter this life changing gadget: Without even knowing what I was doing, I was able to beautifully straighten my hair in 20 minutes, with no flat iron at all. No joke. I even got compliments on my hair, which has only ever happened when I get a professional blowout.
It was easy to use and the brush didn’t tangle at all.

I was concerned that some reviewers said it burned out/broke quickly. Honestly, if that happens, I will immediately order a new one. It’s that good.

I can’t believe how much time and annoyance this device is already saving me. Not to mention how much better I feel about my hair. It really is a game changer for me.",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I bought this based on great reviews from friends and on here, and it does a good job, yes. But I cannot see this as a replacement for a flat iron, much less a round brush and dryer. Several passes to try to curl my bangs as I would with a round brush and dryer combination yielded no results. And while my hair was dried and ""straightened"", it was not as straight and smooth as can be achieved the old fashioned way.
There is no cool shot option to set the style, rather you have to adjust the setting which is in an awkward location at the bottom of the device and it is almost like a dial - not easily done by flicking a switch.
That being said, it did dry fairly the same rate as my hair dryer and impressively, my hair did not get caught in it or pulled out.
I will use this for travel purposes, despite its bulky size, it does beat the size of a dryer in your carry on.",4,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I am part of the colossally uncoordinated club. I was never a sports person. I regularly run into walls. Needless to say, sleek smooth blowouts have always been beyond my skill set. Add to that, I have long hair, and a lot of it, so it would take me like 45-60 minutes to accomplish this feeble attempt at a blowout, so eventually I gave up. Until now. This brush has given me the silkiest, smoothest blowout I’ve had in years, and that’s including the one I had at an expensive salon I went to this summer, and it only took 15 minutes top. If you get a defective one, exchange it for another one, you won’t regret it. Even if this melts a year from now like some people said, I’ll just buy another one. It’s that good.

A couple notes, the temperature control isn’t really temperature control, it’s more like an air flow control. High means more powerful air flow, low means lower air flow. As I’ve only used this once, and I was in a hurry, I didn’t have time to experiment with the low vs. high setting, but this was the impression I got. If I’m wrong, I’ll update my review. The cool setting has high air flow, but it takes a minute to cool off completely. I also used some argan oil on my hair as a heat protectant.",5,2,B01LSUQSB0
"Bought two during amazon prime day. One for me and one for my mom. We’re both VERY happy with this hair dryer. I went in thinking it would be junk (honest) but really feel like it is convenient to use, quick dry even when I’ve only ever used it on low setting and leaves my hair feeling really soft. I have super fine thin hair, naturally wavy. I don’t feel I get the volume everyone raves about. I also feel a little frizzy and like I can’t get my face framing areas super straight but for me it is best to still use my straightener quickly after. My mom has short wavy hair and literally told me “I haven’t had hair this good since I was 18!” This seems like it would be great for anyone with mobility concerns or for using with children. After nearly 2 weeks I haven’t had one time of feeling like my hair was caught or pulled wrong. I also feel like my hair is less on the floor or falling out like I see In the regular brush and hairdryer. Husband approved in that manner! I’d like one with a smaller barrel but overall really love using this thing and I won’t go back to the regular hair dryer.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"This blow dryer is life changing! I have thick wavy hair that tends to get really frizzy when blow dried (or air dried with no product). I’ve been professionally doing hair for the last 20 years and have NEVER been able to just have a blow out and be done. To get rid of frizz I’ve always had to either flat iron or curl my hair afterwords. Well not anymore! My hair is long, below my bra line, and thick. I can go from wet hair to completely dried and styled with just using this dryer in 15 minutes. It’s a FN miracle.

PRO TIP: If you have frizz prone hair, once it’s dry, switch to the cool setting and run over it one more time just to lock it in.",5,2,B01LSUQSB0
"I have wanted to try this dryer/volumizer for a while but wasn't able to justify spending the money when I have a great hairdryer and good round brushes...but then I remembered I am a terrible hair stylist!
This is totally worth the money and then some- I only wash my hair 2-3 times a week because I hate taking time to style it. This device cuts drying time in less than half and is easy to use for volume. I've only played with it a few times but after one use I already felt somewhat knowledgeable and had more volume and my ends were (mostly) curled under.
The trick is to section hair and make sure to not only lift the hair higher and outward from your body while drying but to stop for a few seconds a the roots and again while curling the ends. I highly recommend a good pre-heat lotion or serum as this can leave your hair thirsty; I am 38 years old and never had dry hair issues until recently so I am still trying new products.
I also recommend using the insert to file your warranty with Revlon.com in case of any future issues.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Whoa. Really liked this hairdryer and it was great for a busy working mom like me...until now. Sure, it wasn’t perfect, got a little too hot, but it was fast and made me look nicer than when I started and it did it fast.

But today the darn thing had catastrophic engine failure. I was using the thing like normal, had just starting drying a new section of hair and the fan or motor or whatever just EXPLODED. It was terrifying. It was the kind of noise you hope to never to hear on an airplane. Grindy, metal sounds accompanied by a bad burning smell. I knew the smell was NOT my hair as I had just started a new part and it hadn’t been on long. This was definitely a defect and while I’m first to admit operator error, it wasn’t that either this time.

So, yeah. Thing basically exploded in my hand, made a god awful, high-pitched, grindy chainsaw sound (so loud my husband can running and my two year old yelled “calm down” - lol), and smelling like something was burning before I ripped the plug out of the wall.

Two stars because it was great until the incident. But WOULD NOT RECOMMEND unless this was a rando thing or they fix this fear inciting issue. Just blow dry the old fashioned way, I guess.",2,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I'm totally blown away by this dryer brush! I wasn't sure if it would work well for me, so many things claim they will work miracles, but never do--I have really thick hair, slightly wavy, and never smooth unless I get a blow out at a salon or I use a straightening iron, but then I have no body. I washed my hair, lightly dried it with my blow dryer then used this brush and I absolutely look like I had a professional stylist do my hair. It's super shiny, bouncy, smooth but with body. I'm thrilled! Highly recommend.",5,3,B01LSUQSB0
"Sorry for the long review, but I'm just so excited about this product. I LOVE itI was a bit scared to buy it because a. the negative reviews and b. I was worried the results would be the same as when I try and use a brush and dryer, which is to say not very good. My hair would straighten, but not smoothly and my arms got tired halfway through so it was uneven. Plus I'd still have to use a straightening iron which flattened my hair. However, after a couple uses of this dryer, I have a routine that gives me the results I prayed for. You have no idea how desperately I needed this. I have curly/wavy hair that doesn't hold the curl well and gets very frizzy/piecey looking. My hair straightens pretty easily with a curling or straightening iron, but these damage makes the frizz worse, looks bad and leaves my ends looking not smooth and very damaged looking. Professional blowouts can be great, but cost me $50 plus tip and depending on the stylist, uneven results. The last guy used a setting so high it hurt my scalp and damaged my hair, leaving me with few other options.

Enter this product. It does take some practice, but it's worth it. It is easy to use once you get used to how it works, cuts the time down significantly (nothing crazy, but takes me the same time it does when I style my hair curly and less than using a regular dryer) and leaves my hair smooth, with good body and it LASTS with little maintenance. I do agree with some of the other reviewers that you should only use the low setting, as the dryer gets very hot. The way I do it I never touch the tip, so I don't have a problem holding it, but if you use it, I could see where it's a problem because it does get hot. I turn it on and off in between sections while I'm grabbing a new section, which I think helps. Other tips: let you hair either naturally dry at least 50% of the way or use a regular dryer till it's only damp. It will keep the dryer from overheating and I think results are better and makes the process easier.

As for the quality, I've used it five times and it still works (fingers crossed.) I'll be honest, if this lasts even six months I'd consider it worth it and buy another. Twice a week for six months at $40 total way beats almost $60 for one blowout. Maybe try buying straight from the manufacturer if you're worried about getting a dud? Even paying a bit more it would be worth it in the long haul.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0

"This product looked new out of the box. I apparently didn't look close enough. When I plugged it in for the first time, and put it on low - I thought it sounded like the motor was dying but wasn't for sure. It burned some of my hair and it started smoking almost immediately. It literally was not on for even a minute and it managed to burn my hair and die. I'm laid back with my hair - I take care of it by using high quality but few products in it, haven't colored it in well over a decade, and have been growing it out for years. I hardly even use a blow dryer and can count on one hand how many times I've even used a hot styling tool on it over the last two years. This destroyed my hair in seconds. When I looked at it closer after this happened, I noticed that there were burned or matted bristles on it and hair that was not mine (I have dark brown and this was very blonde hair). I never write a review but this one is necessary. Please don't ever buy this brush/dryer.",1,2,B01LSUQSB0
"Omg. I can’t believe I waited this long to own this product! Not only does it make the entire process of drying your hair 100x easier, the combination of heat & brush allow each move to really count. My hair has some natural curl & frizz. Usually, I’d blow dry my hair & then use a flat iron or a curling iron to get that nice sealed look. This little piece of magic really softens each strand of hair so frizz factor nearly diminishes but the nice round brush allows you to play around & style. I purchased based on reviews & it really is as good as people say. I don’t know or see any problems with bristles as a few people mentioned but unless it broke immediately I think most people would without hesitation buy another. Never bringing another blow dryer with me on travel either. This is all you need except if you want to add an iron product for a specific style.

***Last but not all least - I think this product would work really well for all ethnicities on all types of hair.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I love this thing. I recommend it to everyone I know. I had several friends recommend it to me and they all have varying hair lengths and textures. My hair is naturally wavy, long and thick. My typical hair style is LAZY. I hate doing my hair, it always goes in a pony or a knot on top of my head. This bad boy can give me that salon quality blow out in about 15 minutes from towel dried, 8 minutes if I blow dry my roots with my regular dryer for about 30 seconds. I have those obnoxious short baby hairs around my face that have a mind of their own. This guy whips those into shape as well. So amazing. I wore my hair down more the first week I had it than I had the entire year 😅. I luckily have not experienced the temperature issues other reviewers have. I’ve had it a few months and use it at least every other day. It does get hot, but no hotter than my regular hair dryer.",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I love this product! I never mastered the art of blow drying my hair whilst using a brush so this solved the problem! It is powerful and adjustable (hi/lo/cool) and I love that it has long plastic prongs for detangling and brush bristles for smoothing as I blow dry. I have natural, medium length, 3C hair and I can blow dry completely in about ten minutes. I was truly amazed by this product. It is big but it is easy to hold and I love that it is big because it gets the job done fast. All I do is detangle and section my hair into 4 sections, spray 1 pump of heat protection spray on each section, then proceed to using this. My hair comes out soft and feeling great when I'm done, never scorched or dried out. If I want my hair straight I still have to flatiron it afterwards, but that only takes about ten minutes after using this product because it is perfectly prepped! By the way, I paid full price with no promos or compensation for this review so it is completely unbiased and I seriously think EVERYONE SHOULD GET ONE OF THESE! It will make your hair-styling much easier!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"So I normally use a regular o hair dryer and rolling brush and it takes quite a while to get my hair dry so I can finish flat ironing it. I’ve seen so many great reviews outside of Amazon as well and I started looking into this 2-in-1. Well, when a sale popped up, I jumped on it and omggg- I dried my hair in way less time in comparison to my regular blower!

The only thing is, it’s a bit heavier than my regular blower (really light) and I’m a noodle so my arm was hurting after a while lol. However, the advantage I noticed I had with this dryer is that I can use it with my left arm as well (I’m a righty). So the pro still out weighted the con.

I have short sort of thin hair. My teen has really curly THICK hair and even with her hair, it didn’t take me so long.

Overall- GET IT. You won’t be disappointed.",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"This thing WORKS. I never write reviews but this one had to be done!

I usually take my showers at night so my hair can dry while I sleep and then I flat iron it in the morning. My hair is naturally curly/wavy and I straighten it practically every day. It always feels like such an ordeal to wash my hair, wait for it to dry, and then straighten it. Blow drying it and pulling it straight with a hairbrush has never really worked for me and left my hair super poofy. And I don’t like to blow dry it and then immediately flat iron it because it feels like too much work and too much heat on my hair all at once.

I got this on a whim and really wasn’t expecting much, but when I took my shower today and used this afterwards, I was so impressed. It’s easy and effective. I was immediately able to leave the house with straight hair and felt great.

While my hair isn’t quite as sleek as it would be with a flat iron (my hair is naturally thick and I benefit A LOT from having heat on both sides to make it look thinner), it works well and gets the job done.

It’s definitely not something I would use every day (flat irons will always be my go to) but it’s so relieving to know that if I need to take a morning or midday shower, I’m not relegated to the house for the rest of the day or putting my hair up in a wet bun while waiting for my hair to dry.

I’m happy. It serves exactly the purpose I intended it for and it gives me more options than I previously had.",5,4,B01LSUQSB0
"I had seen reviews from peopl I actually are somewhat aquainted with who report to have naturally curly hair and this product works great for them. So I decided to give it a try.
My hair is curly, like kinky curly, full on if it rains I will have hair so big and poofy I look like a mangy poodle!
I was excited to recieve this as a gift for my birthday, well my results let's just say I can't leave a sterlilng review.
My hair was straight up static frizz! I even used a curl calming cream prior to use to help decrease the frizz, it was awful! My hair is abou 2 3/4 ft long and this was a mess!
That said the product does dry while you brush... however, if you have naturally curly hair, don't waste your time and money, it's not for you.",3,2,B01LSUQSB0
"I started using this product this summer in place of my blow dryer and brush. I liked how fast it worked and the fact that I didn’t have to kill my arms holding the heavy blow dryer behind my head.

I’ve noticed over time my hair just kept splitting at the ends. I would trim it and do a conditioning treatment and then a month later my ends would be split all over again. This is the only hot tool I use. I use leave in conditioner and thermal protection before drying. I also only wash my hair twice a week at the most. Usually once a week so it’s not getting a ton of heat damage or I thought.

I’ve recently realized every time I’ve cleaned the blow dry brush which may be after about 3 uses I have massive amounts of hair caught in the brush. I believe the barrel is getting so hot it is damaging my hair and the bristles are so coarse and dense that my hair is basically ripping out of my scalp. When I used a blow dryer and brush I had never had anywhere near the amount of hair on my brush as this. It’s scary and I immediately just want to throw it away but I wanted to come here and warn people about this.

This tool may be helpful for people with coarse thick hair but anyone who has fine and or curly/dry hair please proceed with caution. I had to cut inches off my hair and I still have a section in the back that is basically see through from my hair being ripped out.",1,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I bought this product to save time but it took longer than my usual blow dryer (Revlon) and straightener (Chi). If you’re used to using both a blow dryer and straightener to achieve pin straight hair, this product is not for you. I followed the directions explicitly but the drying power and straightening power were just not there. I had to go over each piece several times and hold each section of hair to prevent it from falling off of the brush (I brushed down as per the instructions and I have medium to thick hair). I got so frustrated with the product not doing what I expected that half way through I switched to my blow dryer and straightener. Sadly, I will be returning.",1,One,B01LSUQSB0
"This product is life changing!!! Seriously! I have thick wavy/kinky hair with a TON of frizz. I have relied on a flat iron to tame my hair, and frizz since jr high school. This dryer eliminates 90% of my frizz. I can’t say 100 because nothing will ever leave my hair as sleek as a flat iron, but this is the next best thing. I could never go back to just a regular old hair dryer again.
Only cons I have is that this dryer is really loud and takes used to getting how to maneuver it for your hair.
I can now just simply dry my hair and walk around the house with confidence that I don’t have hair that resembles a homeless Pomeranian if I don’t flat iron it after.",5,2,B01LSUQSB0

 HOLY FREAKIN GRAIL PRODUCT. All my life I’ve had THICK, COARSE, DENSE, TIGHT CURLY HAIR. I’m Hawaiian and all my life I’ve had issues with flat ironing and blow drying my hair. I’ve spent more hours than I’d like to admit of my life styling my hair. Before this product, my boyfriend would joke on my hair wash days because he knew it would be at least a two hour process to wash, dry, and style my hair. I bought this after over a year of debate. I waited because I was so afraid of being disappointed by another product. I’ve always envied those girls who could just blow dry their hair without feeling like they just did shoulder day at the gym. In order for me to achieve that “blowout” look I’d have to blow dry, straighten THEN curl my hair. That caused so much damage over the years.
When this product came in the mail I was surprised at how large, yet lightweight it is. The size is perfect for that voluminous, just-got-a-blowout look.
It took me TWENTY TWO minutes to blow dry AND style my hair. My hair feels SOFT and bouncy and is SO shiny. I suck at blow drying my hair but with this product it’s so easy. With my thick hair I still sectioned my hair and did big chunks at a time and it performed amazingly. If you have thick curly dense hair like me and are looking for a product to literally CHANGE YOUR LIFE look NO further.",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
Trying to help my 9yr old daughter manager her full head of long thick hair is a chore at best. This has reduced the number of steps in our daily routine and has made getting ready much easier in the morning. This dryer not only helps brush her hair (straight or curled) but it also helps blow dry it very quickly so she can take a shower in the morning if needed and still have time to get her hair dry and done before we head out the door. There are probably a lot of cool things you can do with this - but for our basic needs - it works very well.,5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"My husband bought this for me for Christmas, I have used it 4 times. I loved it! BUT, I went to plug it in this morning and when I turned it on I heard a faint buzzing sound. It didn't turn on. I turned it off and back on and just the same slight buzzing sound. Then something inside sparked and it started to SMOKE. I quickly unplugged it, smelled terrible, on top of it smoking the handle got incredibly HOT. So hot I was worried it was going to explode (even though there was NO POWER going to it). So I left it outside on the cement. It's TOAST. I'm so happy I didn't put it in my hair first. It would be better if it just stopped working, but that fact that it got SO HOT and wouldn't stop smoking while not connected to the power terrifies me. I don't think this product is safe.",1,4,B01LSUQSB0
"It's important that before you buy this and learn to love or hate it, that you are honest about what type of hair you have. I, for example, have straight hair that no curling iron in history has been able to keep a curl on and i got this device with kate Middleton blowout hair in my dreams. Well, it doesn't exactly do this but ... I can honestly say it does three really great things that my straight hair loves 1) makes it really smooth and shiny 2) gives nice airy volume that a typical round brush and dryer combo does not 3) dries fast.
It does get REALLY hot and you have to practice with it a few times before you perfect the craft but overall ... It's pretty neat and feel like it's worth the purchase. The price here on Amazon was also great, I am seen it in my local grocery store for $60, yikes!",4,One,B01LSUQSB0
"Wow! I'm in awe of this fabulous tool! After reading all the reviews, I was not sure how well this would work on relaxed type 4 mid-back length hair. I followed the advice of a few reviewers and air-dried my hair (2 weeks post-relaxer) for approximately 2 hours first, so it was damp not dripping wet.

This tool is powerful and the high setting does a quick and excellent job of drying and straightening the dampest hair strands. I used the low setting for the nearly dry hair strands and it did a great job of drying and straightening too. I dried my hair in 2-inch sections but starting at the ends from the ""underside"" of the hair and working my way up to the roots, spending more time at the roots to ensure thoroughly dry. Then I passed the tool on top of the hair to ensure sleekness. I love that I don't need to flat iron my hair afterwards, as the ceramic coating basically makes it a blow dryer and flat iron in one, at least for my hair. Yay to less styling time and heat!!! Looks just like I visited the salon - smooth, sleek and shiny!

WARNING- do not have any other devices plugged in the same power strip or outlet while using this tool and switched on. I had the TV on while using this, and they shared a surge protector and the power went out of the outlet and killed the surge protector after the first five minutes of use. Had to reset the breaker to return power to the outlet, but the surge protector is dead.

The true test will come when I'm due for a relaxer touch-up. I just hope that this tool lasts, as I realize it had a short lifespan for some.",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I was skeptical that ANYTHING could tame my thin, fine, frizzy, damaged locks. But omg this hair dryer is amazing! I still use hot rollers afterwards to further help but I no longer *need* to. Big self-esteem boost since I was starting to look at wigs and hair toppers for help!

Now that I’m energized by something actually working (when nothing seemed to make a difference before), I’ve started trying some newer, additional, hard-to-find things. I switched hair colors after doing some research and the brand “Schwarzkopf Keratin Color” is the only one that doesn’t leave my hair feeling rough and damaged washing it out. I’ve never had a hair color NOT make my strands feel damaged so that was quite a surprise. The only downside is that the colors are limited.

Sometimes at night at bedtime I will put some oil (pure oil of some kind - jojoba or coconut - not dimethicone or anything that’s not actually moisturizing) on my hands and run my hands through my hair. I figured if moisturizer helps my skin before bed, why not hair? That does also seem to help.

Also a microfiber hair towel seems gentler on things.

Lastly, a satin or silk pillowcase to reduce hair breakage when sleeping. I think this does help but it’s so hot I’m not sure I can keep it up.

But the most important part of the equation is this dryer. Best results when I separate it in sections and dry.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I have super super curly hair and have never been able to find a tool like this to be beneficial to my hair. I read the reviews and ordered because I knew I could return if it wasn’t what I hoped it would be. Wow, I was totally shocked! I will never go without this. I was able to fully dry/“blow out” my hair in about 10 minutes and could have gone without even running a flat iron through it! It minimized the frizz and I had more volume than I’ve had in a lonnng time!! Highly recommend. You won’t be disappointed if you’re a curly girl 😉",5,2,B01LSUQSB0
"Love this hair dryer. It really does a great and efficient job. It allows for a lot of lift at the root and leaves my hair (naturally curly and coarse) smooth and I don’t have to follow up the drying of my hair with a flat iron. I have only used it during the winter when there is less humidity, so Summer blow-outs might prove to be a different story. It is a big fat oval brush and works fantastically on my chin length bob, but I’m certain it would be great for hair of any length except a pixie cut. It gets really hot, and it is easy to accidentally touch the hot barrel while attempting to manipulate the dryer in the back and the right side of my head. It is a little loud and would be heavy for anyone with problems raising their arms above their head. If I could change anything about it, it would be to have a tip on the end of the brush so that it could be used to more easily grab the end of the brush without fear of touching the hot barrel to help with rotating the brush on certain sections of my hair. I am very pleased with it and the price point is fantastic. The handle is nice an big and has an ergonomic grip that is big enough for me to use both of my hands to help twist and move the dryer downward through my hair. I highly recommend this dryer.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I have wave curly hair. The 1 step brush and heat method did not work for me at all.
The heat settings gets very hot, damaging my fine hair. I also disliked the brush material at all.

I prefer the traditional 2 steps method, brush and a hair dryer not attached together that I have been using for the last 40 years gives best results with much less damage to my hair. IF someone have good quality brushes and hair dryer and know how to blow dry their own hair, I don't think they will like the 1 step brush results.",1,2,B01LSUQSB0
"With the Covid situation I could not go to a salon and get my hair cut. My normally very short hair quickly grew out past chin length. My hair grows incredibly fast and is very thick. I needed something to blow dry my hair but not make me looks like I came from a Halloween video. This tool is a big help. But with my hair so thick it takes forever to finish. So I just do the top and sides. And it get HOT way too fast. By the time I finish just the sides I have to set it aside and let it cool down before I can go on. I have resorted to sliding a piece of copy paper between my face and the brush to keep the extreme heat off my skin. And thas is on the LOW setting. I have used high a few times on the back, but I cannot tolerate the extreme heat. This might be a good tool for someone with thin hair, but if you have Hollywood thick hair like I do, it isn't the best choice. On the good side, it does give a nice smooth finish without having my hair look like I stuck my finger in a light socket.",4,0,B01LSUQSB0
"i bought this stupid dryer because of people i was following on IG advertised it along with showing how to use it. A couple of those people mentioned that it gets too hot and one wore a glove. I eneded up buying this and using it. I can tell you that with 1st use it got SUPER hot and burned my face and neck - all red in the picture. it was awful. i will never use this again.

Side note: I reached out to the folks on IG who advertized it and one of them told me that revlon sent them this brush for free in exchange for a demo video. And she said after that she never ever used it. I can see why...I wish people were genuine in their reviews and not get sucked into this ""freebie"" stuff.",1,One,B01LSUQSB0
I have purchased two of these. The first one started sparking on me randomly. One day I was drying my hair and started hearing pops and feeling pain on my head. I pulled the hair dryer back to look at what was happening and every 5 seconds it was sparking with the same popping noise. I threw it away and bought another one because I liked the idea of this hair dryer. I have chronic pain in my shoulders so using a typical hair dryer and brush at the same time is really difficult for me. Ive had this second one for just a few months with pretty minimal use. I wear my hair natural most of the time but like to style it straight on occasion. Out of nowhere it starts smelling like burning every time I try to use it. This is so damaging to hair and honestly a fire and electrical hazard. I wouldn't recommend this to literally anyone.,1,0,B01LSUQSB0
"As far as the product is concerned, my wife, daughter and all of their friends say this is THE blower/dryer to get! I’ve purchased this item for my wife and daughter and again, the blower is super! However, my only complaint this time around is that the item was shipped to me in its own box, inside a bag! As you might guess, the box inside of the bag took a beating and thankfully, there wasn’t any damage to the blower. However, in buying a $61 item for my wife, there are reasons to believe that so many things could have gone wrong! When I first bought this blower for my daughter in December, it was shipped in a box and the box inside arrived undamaged. I would suggest a better approach to shipping electronic care products in the future!",3,2,B01LSUQSB0
"Update: this item broke after about 5 uses, 7 days after my Amazon return window closed. I wad drying my hair and it started making popping/ snapping noises. I turned it off, allowed it to cool and tried to run it again (away from my head) and it continued to do the same thing and omitting a burning smell.
The manufacturer has been unresponsive to my emails asking for support on the product.
Again it's been maybe 5 uses, never been dropped or mishandled in any way. For the price the longevity and support from the manufacturer is unacceptable. The concept is great, quality is not.

This thing is amazing. Completely eliminates trying to manage a brush and you're hair dryer at the same time. You do need to section your hair to get the most volume and smoothness but the results are incredible.",1,2,B01LSUQSB0
"I read a lot of reviews on this before buying. Even after reading them, I still contemplating the purchase. I usually just wash my hair before bed so it dries by the time I wake up. This tool has allowed me to go to bed in winter without wet hair. I only did this to cut down on morning prep time. Using this dryer in a brush tool has changed my morning routine for the best. I can use this, then quickly use my flat iron on larger chunks of hair to help with that frizz that still lingers. It’s not as much as what a blow dryer does, but there is still a a slight frizz. I’m so glad I bought this.",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"This is an awesome hair care tool! I have thin hair that wants to be curly but can't quite get there so it settles for frizzy, which requires a lot of work to not look like a bad 80's perm. This dryer cuts my drying & straightening time by at least 50% and gives great, glossy results, but it has 2 downfalls: loudness & placement of the on/off switch. The twist on/off switch is at the base of the handle & everytime I dry the back of my head, my hand touches the switch & turns off the dryer. Frustrating, but the biggest problem is the noise coming out of this thing. Holy decibels right next to your ears. I honestly wear ear plugs while doing my hair, otherwise my ears ring when I turn it off. If you're looking for an easy to use tool to give you great results, this will do it, but be sure to protect those ears!",4,2,B01LSUQSB0
"I had this hair dryer for about 4 months and used it maybe a dozen times when it stopped getting hot. It still turned on and worked on cool and low, but no longer got hot enough to dry my hair. I read that other users had similar problems and went through Revlon to get another one, but I called Amazon first and they gave me a ""one time exception"" for a return and refund, but also charged me a $3 ""restocking"" fee. I don't know why it would even be ""restocked"" since it's basically defective. Also- be aware of how your dryer looks when you take it out of the box.
I noticed the printed setting font on the base indicating ""off, cool, low, high"" looked faded on mine right out of the box so maybe it was a used and returned item. Overall it's a great product that cuts your hair drying time in half.",3,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I was skeptical to try this but had my fingers crossed it was really as good as the reviews say. My hair is a mix of wavy, curly and frizzy and when I choose to straighten it, it takes blow drying and a straightener on the hottest setting to get it smooth without the frizz. If I just blow dry it, it is fairly puffy and frizzy without the straightener. It took a minute to figure out how to use this thing (I ended up starting with the bottom layer and working my way up, as well as rolling the brush so my hair was on both sides of the brush as I worked my way through it). This thing is amazing. I can literally get rid of my blow dryer and straightener because this does both, but even better - it adds volume and looks amazing, saves me time and is less damaging to my hair! I'm so glad I bought this and will be telling friends and family about it! It is fairly heavy and does have a high pitch noise, small price to pay for what it does. Very pleased!",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"Initially I was in love with this product until I noticed that it was BURNING MY HAIR OFF after just one use. It was getting very hot so I switched back and forth to the cool setting just to be cautious, sometimes turning it off and giving it a break to cool down. I was even using it on the low setting. Still, I noticed afterwards that my newly styled hair had short pieces on the top of my head that were frizzled, cut short, and sticking straight up away from my head. The fried-off pieces of hair were left between the brush bristles.

It's a bummer because I really like the design of the brush head, the ease of use, and how quickly I could style my whole head. If they come out with a newer version with a temperature control I will be be all over it.",2,2,B01LSUQSB0
"I never imagined that using a brush/blow dryer combo could provide the perfect blowout. My hair is so soft, smooth, straight and doesn’t require a flat iron after I use this. I used no products and I achieved the best results, better than I do from getting a blowout at the salon. I have natural curl, some friz, medium length mostly all gray (but colored blonde) hair. I live in Florida where the humidity is usually above 85. I blew my hair out in half the time it took me to blow and flat iron. So take it from me, I’ve tried everything and this product really works. Less damage to your hair as well!
It’s now March 2020 and this dryer is DEAD! It will not power on for whatever reason. Also, half of the bristles have fallen out. All in just over a year. I loved this dryer for the first six months BUT once the bristles began falling out, they continued to disappear at an alarming rate. There were bristles everywhere each time I used it, which was only one to four times each week. Some weeks I didn’t use it at all. Now I am torn on repurchasing the same one or finding one from a different company with better reviews. I really loved how fast my curly hair blew out straight without the need of a flat iron in record time, so I need to find a replacement.",1,One,B01LSUQSB0
"This tool is a game-changer for sure. It is a little bulkier than some of my other hair tools which makes traveling with it a nuisance but it is SO WORTH IT for how well it styles my hair.. It took me a few times to get the technique down but I’ve got it now and it only takes me about 15-20 minutes to turn my damp hair into a nice sleeked blow out look.
For reference, my hair is pretty thick, wavy, and very frizzy.

Tips for user:
- do not use on soaking wet hair. I found that it is easier to use and gives the best results when my hair was only somewhat wet.
-BRUSH YOUR HAIR OUT VERY WELL. You want to make sure your hair is very well brushed before using it because just like a regular round brush, it will pull.
-It takes practice. It definitely took me like 2-3 times to get the motion of it down, so don't give up when you use it the first time and it doesn't give good results.

Overall, this tool really did help me step up my hair game and it's a decent price.",5,2,B01LSUQSB0
"This product works SO MUCH BETTER than my regular hair dryer!! It makes my normally frizzy and awkwardly waved hair smooth and straight with a ton of volume. I’ve never been able to get a salon worthy blowout by myself until now! It’s a little heavier than my regular hair dryer and sometimes it’s difficult to hold onto the tip to get the hair to curl the way I want, but overall I highly recommend this and am so happy I purchased it! I don’t travel often but think I’d need to buy a travel case for this since it’d be awkward to pack. But overall I still give this a 9.9/10",5,2,B01LSUQSB0
"I am not exaggerating when I say this hairdryer changed my life. My hair comes out looking like a professional blowout. I’ve gotten so many unsolicited compliments on my hair since I started using this dryer. I also feel like I have little hair damage because I only use this dryer versus a traditional hair dryer and straightener or curler.

I do wait about 5 minutes post-shower so my hair can air dry a bit. After it dries, I put my hair in a small bun, spray with hair spray, and then I have gorgeous smooth curls when I take it down.",5,3,B01LSUQSB0
"I cannot even express how happy I am with this blow dryer styling tool. I struggled my entire life with frizzy unmanageable hair. I would wash my hair the night before because it always looked better when I styled it the next day. I live in Florida where the humidity is high and my hair would be frizzy minutes after walking out the door.

I am thrilled and the ease of blowing drying and styling my hair with one tool, in less than 15 minutes. Seriously, I never thought my hair could be so glamorous. I have long hair so the tool works nicely. It might be a struggle for people with shorter hair.

The product is big and bulky and does take a few minutes to learn to use, but wow o wow. I truly am amazed and glad I bought this.

Great product, my hair looks amazing!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"In general, this item works well. While it is not the miracle product it's made out to be, it shortened the time it takes to style my hair and has given me better results than my former routine (blow dry and flat iron) did.
Pros: Relatively easy to use and gets easier with practice; doesn't take too long to dry/style my thick hair (about 20 min); does a great job for straight hair styles
Cons: Does not provide any added shine as advertised; in fact, the heat tends to leave hair ends frizzy. I only use this dryer twice a week, and feel my hair would be completely fried (even with a heat protector) if I used it more often.",4,One,B01LSUQSB0
"This is the absolute worst thing you could do to your hair. I had seen so many videos and photos of people saying this was the holy grail of hair products so after reading and watching hours of reviews, I decided to give it a shot. I’ve been using it for about 3 weeks now and I loved how soft my hair felt and how fast it dried. I was in love with it and told all my friends to get one. Then I saw a picture of my hair from a month ago compared to today... I LOST INCHES!! This dryer has burnt my hair to the point it just broke off from the heat! My hair is way shorter now. My friends all noticed that my hair is very thin now too! I used to have rather thick hair but now my hair ties are literally FALLING out of my hair when I try to wear a ponytail due to the hair being so thin!!

I cannot believe the damage that this caused my hair.

DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!! Especially if you don’t want to lose your precious hair 😢",1,2,B01LSUQSB0

Truly frustrating since I can't simply return it now since it died on the 31th day which is outside the return period and going through the Revoln warranty process I have to send them $5.00 to even consider replacing this item. Based on some of the recent reviews, I am not the only one with issue. I just want my $60 back so that I can find a different product. This one clearly has some issues that need to worked on to make it a better product.",1,15,B01LSUQSB0
"Okay, maybe don't throw it out but this handy tool takes the place of a round brush and blow dryer. I bought this after borrowing it from a friend. I have chin-length fine hair-super slippery and on wash day very flat. This tool gives me volume without tons of effort. The combination bristles hold my hair to the brush and the length lets you dry large sections. I took off one star because after searching and being sure I had the same one as my friend (Costco is selling a slightly smaller version right now, I nearly bought that before noticing) I discovered that the swivel part meant to keep the cord tangle free isn't long enough so every few passes of my hair I have to slide my hand down the brush handle to knock off the excess cord that's being wrapped about the brush. Its pretty irritating-hopefully the designers are able to go back to the different swivel piece that kept the cord from wrapping around the brush handle. This tool gives you the bounce and volume you get from the hair salon. I use a volumizing spray and heat protectant and section my hair. It is loud (I always use the low setting) and does make the head warm but I think the trade-off is slightly quicker dry time and not having to fumble with a brush and dryer. If you want consistent bouncy blow-outs that are easy to acheive, buy this!",4,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I have been hearing people rave and seeing videos about about how this product is so great.
So decided to go ahead and purchase it. I am the type who dreads blow drying and straightening my hair, because it is such a chore. After receiving the Revlon One-Step Hair Dryer And Volumizer Hot Air Brush I woke up early the next morning because I was not sure how long it would take to do my hair. After i finished. I was literally blown away. No Pun intended. It not only smooth and straighten, it also dried my hair in record time. I have med-long thick hair and it usually takes me an hour to do both but with the Revlon One-Step Hair Dryer And Volumizer Hot Air Brush I was done done in 20 mins. My hair was dry and smooth. I don't understand why I waited so long to purchase this product.
I am very pleased, Revlon you did an awesome job with this.",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I give this hair tool a 9/10 WOULD BUY AGAIN and I did buy it again! My hair is so crazy thick BUT my actual hairs are fine, so to say I’ve had issues getting it styled in the past is an understatement. Is it curly? Is it straight? WHO KNOWS! I definitely like my hair straight more, so this tool is very helpful!! I also like to shower at night, but hate going to bed with my hair wet since it takes hours to dry NOT ANYMORE!
I timed it. Between showering, waiting for my hair to not be soaking wet anymore, and using this tool, it takes me 45 minutes to be washed and presentable again. An hour if you really take the time to style it good. I only give it a 9/10 because my hair is soooo thick I do have to go in some with a straightener afterwards, but this tool gets me 80% there.

My husband has light, whispy, blonde hair that makes him look bald in the front because he kind of is. NOT ANYMORE. He used this, I said HA that won’t work on your hair, 5 minutes later I’m asking if he put on a wig!! This is amazing so we bought a second one for his own use. His hair isn’t even very long, maybe 3-4 inches in the front, but hallelujah it looks like he has hair in the front again, all he had to do was style it!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I was never good at styling my long, thick, wavy hair with a round brush and hair dryer. It just didn’t look like a salon blow out. Due to the pandemic, I have not been to a hair salon in 6 months. I have been trimming the ends of my layered hair as needed, but my hair has looked so frizzy all the time. I decided to try this Revlon hot air brush and I love it!

The barrel is very thick, but when you hold it at the narrowed part, it is comfortable. I often use two hands to hold the barrel due to the size of this being large, not due to it being heavy. I have used this twice with amazing results: lots of volume, curl at the ends and a smooth finish. I have only used this on low and cool settings after towel drying my hair. The low is plenty hot for me. I can completely dry my thick hair in 10 -12 minutes on the low setting. The high runs too hot for me.

This tool is super easy to use and delivers salon-like results for people with no styling experience.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I have small hands, not presidential small, but small nonetheless. When I first saw the size of this thing, I though I'd end up with carpal tunnel halfway through.

I'm happy to say it was easy to manage and it did an excellent job on my very full, waist-long hair. It's definitely worth it. It won't substitute a good salon blow-out but in the middle of a pandemic, where we should go out as little as possible, it did the trick.",5,2,B01LSUQSB0
"Used this product for almost an entire year and loved it so much. It taught me how to blow dry my hair and I loved it when it worked which was for about 9 months. (bought April 2020). I think that the brush handle is hard to grip with just one hand after a few minutes of drying, and it is a tad heavy for my liking. The bottom part of the dryer that sucks in air became easily clogged at bottom often and was not easy to clean. The dryer eventually lost drying power after 10 months of daily use, and I had to throw it in the trash when it began shooting sparks at my head from the inside of the brush and shorting out. That being said, I used this product daily for 10 months so I definitely got my money’s worth. Going to look around at different brands this time around.",3,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Was very hesitant to try this out because my main concern was with my curly hair how will it tame the roots and shorter baby hairs. It dries my roots great, the little hairs I still have to figure out how to tame, but it gives great volume for sure. I gave it 4 stars because when it’s on high or cool it has a really high pitched noise that makes me ears ring after using it. I don’t know if that’s supposed to happen or not but it’s really loud, much louder than a hair dryer. Other than that my hair is styled with volume after 20 minutes and then I use a curling iron still afterwards for the curl bounce that I love!

Review update:
After having this for about 2 weeks now I have to drop stars because I cannot take the high pitched screeching noise and I will try to return this one and maybe try a more expensive one to see if this is a common issue with all dryer brushes.",2,0,B01LSUQSB0
"OK, so its a nice dryer so far on use 1. Has a warmish cool setting that blows a lot of air,( my preference to get it a bit dry) a medium air setting that says low but gives you a lot of heat to curl or straighten.2nd use, small bristles on brush falling out so deducted a star.Also be very careful not to use high heat setting to long.Will burn hair. Dry on cool, then just use med setting to straighten or curl.

High is high air and high heat .
It is a bit heavy but its a big brush with a good bit of power. i semi dried my hair first before pulling to straighten frizz then curve under and out",3,2,B01LSUQSB0
"This is a definite YES! My hair is long and I have a lot of hair (literally a massive amount)
My texture is wavy, not curly yet not straight. My usual routine is to wash my hair at night and allow it to semi dry, and the next morning it’s still fairly wet (because I put it in a bun) it still takes a lot of time. I blow dry it, then flat iron it. It takes At least an hour...
So I was skeptical about this product. I was pleasantly surprised by how well this worked for me. It took about 15 to completely dry and style my hair using only the one-step hair dryer.
I highly recommend this product!",5,5,B01LSUQSB0
"This is by far was one of the most effective hair tools I’ve ever purchased. And it’s also one of the most inexpensive tools I now own. I ended up buying two, one for my mother who is 55 and myself (I’m 31), and it’s amazing how well it suits both of our needs. She has shorter hair and maintains a more mature hair style (slightly big waves, above her shoulders) and I have long (a little past my elbows) thick hair, and it has been a game changer for both of us. Especially when it comes to how fast it works. My mom is done within 5 minutes and I’m done in 10-12 minutes, depending on what I’m doing with my hair. I can't begin to describe how much that has helped my morning routine.

The only downside for me personally is that although my hair has never looked so shiny and felt so silky, I can’t manage to give it big waves with this tool. My hair just goes flat and mostly straight. And mind you, I have a lot of thick hair. It's not a matter of texture or hair quality as I can make big waves easily with a round brush and blowdryer but with this, no matter how I tried using it, I couldn't achieve a style that looked voluminous. So I basically use it mainly for when I want straight hair, which is still okay since my straightener would never in a million years give me the shine and softness that this tool provides.

The second negative thing is that it can get heavy for me. My wrist will tire, but that's also probably due to the fact that I just have a lot of hair, so not going to knock off any stars for that.

It's an otherwise fantastic tool!",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"How have I lived without this so many years?!?!

I have long thick, frizzy, wavy/curly hair. Between 2c and 3a curl type. I love my curls and embrace them. However, it's nice to have smooth hair that I can run a brush through daily. In the winter I tend to blow dry and straighten my hair, it's easier to manage and I'm not walking out with wet hair in freezing weather.

When I became a Mom spending 30+ min just on my hair is not realistic. A friend of mine has a more expensive brand of blow drying brush and loves it. However; I can't spend $100+ on a hair tool right now. I dug into researching blow drying brushes and naturally the Revlon one kept popping up.

The first time I used it I only put a heat protector on my hair. I didn't use any smoothing/straightening serums. I was BLOWN AWAY by the results. In 12 min I had smooth, shiny, perfectly voluminous, blown out hair. It was AMAZING. Since then I have always used a heat protector and a smoothing serum to protect my hair. And I spend about 15min really working it to style. I'll be damned it looks Salon Quality.

Another great thing is on my no-wash days I can run it back through my hair to freshen it up in the morning. No more unruly or overly flat hair!

Prior to using, I was worried my hair would still be super frizzy. I usually have to run the straightener through my blow dried hair to tame it enough to leave the house. And using a round brush with my blow dryer leaves me exhausted and defeated at the end of it. This eliminates the extra step of straightening to smooth and you don't have to wrestle a brush and a dryer.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I bought this product being very skeptical because a product must be very powerful to handle my hair. I have been straightening my hair since i was 6 or 7 and I’ve used any straightening product out there. I thought this one would burn by the time I straighten all my hair. Not only it did not burn, but it only takes 20-30 mins only. My hair is super long and curly and I usually use big round brush and drybar blow dryer. With those it takes about 45-60 mins. I am so impressed by this product. The only issues are 1- the sound is too loud so if u wanna use it late at night or super early in the morning, it may not be a considerable act if u have neighbors. 2- it actually straighten so well that ur hair gets flat on top and oily faster than usual (and i have super dry hair and skin).
But I still really recommend it and give 5stars.
😊 love it. I just hope it doesn’t burn soon lol",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I have fine, thin, shoulder length blonde hair. For me this was not the magical product others are saying it is. Yes, it gave my hair volume. Yes, it left my hair fairly smooth and shiny.

A couple of complaints. It’s heavy. Way heavier than any blow dryer I have used. It takes longer to use than a normal blow dryer on my hair- so I found my arms getting tired. Two, it pulled quite a bit of my hair out. That’s pulled hair from only three usages in my pics. That’s far more than I pull out with a round brush and normal dryer. The hair seems to get snagged where the softer bristles are on the side. Third, it’s pretty hot. I had high hopes this would be a replacement for my every day dryer. But with how hot it is, I cannot. It would be too damaging for my fine hair.

All in all- a good additional tool to have in my drawer. But no my new go to despite high hopes.",4,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Wow!! My hair is SUPER thick and wavy, and dries puffy if I let it air dry. I stopped even trying to style it and moved to putting it in a bun 90% of the time, because I don’t feel like spending the 1.5-2 hours it takes to blow dry and straighten it. I was BLOWN. AWAY to see the volume, shine, and absolute drying POWER this machine gives!! My hair looked like this (see photo), and was totally dry in just 30 short minutes! I’m even willing to overlook how loud it is, because of how easy it is us to use, and how fabulous it makes my hair look.
Would have been 5 stars, but I gave it 4 because it left my hair in back a bit wavy at the roots, while I like it to be totally straight if I’m going to bother to heat style. Next time I might plug in the straightener to make sure the back looks perfect.
Otherwise, so easy to use- such a great tool.",4,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Got because I have naturally (fairly) straight hair but sometimes it gets a tad wavy, I like to use this at night so I don't need to flat-iron my hair in the morning. The product works great however it gets REALLY hot, like.. REALLY, REALLY hot. There's only two temp settings, one is cool enough to where it doesn't really dry much, the hot setting is too hot. I have to whip it through really quick and keep it away from my scalp, neck and ears so that it doesn't get too warm on my skin. So, it get's really hot BUT with that knowledge and keeping it away from skin and working quickly it does work well.",4,One,B01LSUQSB0
"My hair is a little longer than shoulder length and although thick years ago its medium weight now. At 57, I am very careful about my hair. This works very fast; less time on the hair. After reading the instructions on how to move dryer for each smooth, volume, curls, I attempted each one. The end result was a flipped, smooth, shiny blowout in less than 10 mins. I am very pleased with price, and end result. Cons: the area you grip is very big. If you have tiny hands it might cause an issue with ability to hold onto. I would like a few more temp, flow control, as I used the cool setting, after drying roots, on most of my head. A friend of mine bought the really expensive brand of these, tried hers and I feel this Revlon is just as good. I would highly recommend and will continue to use.",4,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I saw this product on a Facebook list of “products that actually work” so of course wanted to see.... I read comments and interacted with many ppl on the list and got real life opinions, photos. I have shoulder length, naturally curly hair. Not thin, not thick, and not glorious like commercials. It can get very unruly. 😂
I don’t normally dry or style it. I’m impatient like that, and a “wash and wear” girl most of the time.
Saw it has 187k reviews, 4+ stars, so went for it. Showered, used a light leave in conditioner and some heat protection spray- .... voila!
Towel dry to dry and normal looking in 4 minutes. Just right for someone like me who spends virtually no time on their hair.
High/low/cool settings, light weight.
Easy to use.
At first I thought it would be too big for my lack of hair- but I can admit I was pleasantly surprised and would now recommend.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"So wanted to love this dryer. I almost do short of the fact that there's no easy way to clean it in between uses and there's little control over heat.
The barrel is quite large and oddly oval shaped. For my medium/long hair, it doesn't quite allow me to give it a good tight wrap around for a nice flipped end without scorching my hair. There are only high, medium and cool settings and high is hella HOT!. IF I work quick enough and with an abundance of heat protectant, I get a sleek overall style with lot's of movement. But, that's it. No flip, no volume. I go in with a flat iron after to curl it and get some volume.
As far as cleaning after each use, it's a pain. Remaining product is stuck in all the bristles, the barrel isn't removable so you can't wash it. I take 2 stiff bristle brushes and my bowdryer after each use and work it throughout the barrel in all directions while pointing the dryer at it to blow away the dried up particles. After that, I take a damp rag and work it up and down each row of bristles and around the upper and lower barrel to remove any remaining product that could get into my next clean blowout. Too much work for meh results. Overpriced and overrated. Box was thrown out so I'm stuck with it.",3,0,B01LSUQSB0
"When I first started using it, I was amazed. My drying time was reduced from 30-40 minutes to 11 minutes!! After about 4 months, my hair started thinning out and I started noticing large bald spots. My hairdresser suggested it maybe the dryer so I stopped using it and my hair is definitely growing back. Sad that this was too good to be true. Maybe with better temperature control it would be better.",2,3,B01LSUQSB0
"I am currently deployed and I purchased this because keep my curly hair straight is easiest. I skipped bringing a hairdryer because it was extra bulk and I thought I could skip the straightening step. WELL. It just arrived today and I dove right in, this thing almost caught my hair on fire. It sparks, it smells like electrical burning, and it all but melted my skin. It's loud, bulky, and just not what I'm looking for. Be careful, like the reviews state, just use a hairdryer and a round brush.",1,3,B01LSUQSB0
"Burned out after only 5 months... barrel got extremely hot stopped working.
I loved this dryer- best dryer straightener I’ve ever had. Gives tons of body and shine. But doesn’t last and costs way too much considering that it dies. Many others seem to have this same problem.",1,8,B01LSUQSB0
"You'll have to forgive my pictures, after a long day at work and pulling my back, I wasn't feeling ""selfie ready"". But I wanted to show you all how amazing this tool is.

My hair is very thick, and even after recently getting 11"" cut off, it still takes over 30 minutes to blow dry my hair. It's a hassle, I get hot and sweaty, and it's more of a chore than anything. I heard nothing but great things about this tool, but I've also heard nothing but great things about other hair dryers too, that didn't live up to the expectations I had. So as you can imagine, I was skeptical. But, what the hell. I've tried everything, what's another $35 bucks if this didn't work out? So I went for it.

Tonight, after I showered, I put in my typical hair product after letting my hair towel dry for 10 minutes, and was honestly expecting to be disappointed. I mean it was nothing but an oversized brush. How could this change my life?

I grabbed my first chunk of hair, put the brush at the roots, and slowly pulled the brush to the ends of my hair... And it was DRY. Not wet, not damp. DRY. Ladies, I was SHOOK. I continued, and within 10 minutes (I believe less) my hair was done. Not only was it dry, it was silky, soft, and looked the same way it did when I left the salon 2 months ago after getting my hair done.

I just want to know, where has this thing been all my life? I've tried everything, from cheap-o brands to high end. I've paid a few bucks, and top dollar. This tool is the only thing that made a difference, and a noticable one at that.

It is a little large for my fat little baby hands, but for what it delivered, I can look past that ALL day long.

Ladies of all hair kinds, lend me your ears. Get this hair dryer. It will CHANGE your hair routine!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I was very skeptical of whether this product would work as advertised. I have naturally curly and frizzy hair. I have had to straighten my hair my whole life cause I don’t have the “pretty” curl. Mine just frizzes out of control. I’ve even had the permanent straighteners done, but those wash/grow out after time as well. However, I took a leap of faith and bought it (my mom also recommended it). Tonight was the first night using it and I’m here to tell you that I was thoroughly impressed with the way it made my hair feel, the amount (lack there of) time it took to dry and straighten my hair all in one step. Plus, it didn’t make my hair feel “heavy” like the flat iron does. I would highly recommend this product to anyone that battles with the curl and frizz. It’s a One step wonder!!!

I did let my hair dry in a towel for about 10-15 min and then just towel dried a little, put some heat cream on and sectioned it off to dry. It works amazingly.",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I was a bit hesitant to buy this product considering some of the reviews and the price was marked down. I immediately thought this wasn't going to be a good purchase and thought that it would be cheap. Ive damaged my hair throughout the years very badly by dying it. It even stopped growing. Ive tried to let my hair air dry to keep away from heat but once it's dried, I look like Albert Einstein that stuck my finger in an electric socket. I bought the L'ange hair dryer brush and I thought I found my solution. My hair was silky smooth, however after spending $90 on it, I noticed the bristles were starting to melt and also bend. So I decided just to give this one a shot. I was suprised that this hair dryer brush doesnt feel cheap at all. One review advised to use the lower heat to avoid damaging my hair. I did notice when using the high setting, the heat is pretty intense. So keep that in mind. I'd rather take my time using the low setting than damaging my hair to save time. I will admit the L'ange hairdryer brush made my hair silky and smooth but I don't think the bristles are the best quality. This brush definitely does its job and with the right heat protection products you'll have great results! So far I love it.",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"This was just okay in my opinion. I agree with other reviewers that said this didn’t do anything for their hair type. I had the same experience. I got no more volume than I would if I did a quick blow dry with my head turned upside down, no brush just dryer. The barrel is also quite big which I didn’t care for. I wish it had better heat setting controls. The worst part was because of its size for my medium length fine hair, I still had to grab my flat iron after I was done to fix my ends. It just wasn’t life changing for me and my fine hair so it was returned. At this price point I could see the heat changes and can see why some say this gets too hot.",3,3,B01LSUQSB0
"Highly disappointed in this product! Switched it on to the low setting but within seconds there is a strong burning smell and sparks. I decided to let it cool for a bit for the fear that it might explode but the problem still persists. This product is really noisy as well. It's a total waste of my money as I didn't even get to use it once! A pity to have spent $100 + on this product, inclusive of shipping, only to learn that I have to spend on return shipping as well and waste more money? ZERO STARS!!!",1,9,B01LSUQSB0
"I really love the idea of this tool but I think I have a defective unit. (My sister loves her and has no problems.) It’s very hot and literally smokes when I use it! At first I thought it was steam and maybe my hair was too wet - even after letting it air dry for an hour. But it was smoke. So much smoke that it set off my Nest smoke alarm (Nest differentiates between steam and smoke). I also thought perhaps it was some type of manufacturing oil burning off. So I tried it a few more times on almost-dry hair (both with and without heat protectant spray, in case that was the culprit). And while it does a decent job of drying and styling, it still smokes. Sadly, I don’t use it any more for fear of ruining my hair. Or worse, cause a fire.",2,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I was skeptical when I purchased this after reading all these great reviews calling the product ""life-changing."" I have shoulder length hair that I color frequently. I blow dry it and use a styler tool at least 5 times a week. After each blow dry, my hair looks dry, frizzy, dull, and lifeless. Then I purchased this revlon tool and life-changing? Maybe. Hair and confidence changing? Without a doubt! My hair is now shiny, bouncy, and smooth! I will never use a regular hair dryer again. I have put my straight iron in storage. I do throw some occasional curls in it, but with the revlon styler, I have a better base for these curls. I feel like I just stepped out of a salon every single day! I have recommended this to all my friends. The device is a little heavy and bulky, but you will get used to it quickly. I use it on the low setting, as the high setting is fairly noisy and gets very hot. If you are patient, this item can be purchased for a cheaper price herr or various sites, but it is worth all of $60. This revlon styler is deserving of every rave review.",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"Literally the best thing you will buy this year.
I got mine a few months ago and even convinced my hair dresser to do a product demo on her social media. She prefers this to any other hair dryer especially the Dyson which is $300 and takes 100 hours to dry your hair.

This revlon brush is amazing - I’m horrible at doing my hair but have my mother’s voice in my head saying never to leave the house without your hair done lol bc you could meet a man!! Lol
Anyway, it takes me 10 min from wet/towel dried to soft and straight dry hair that looks like I just paid for a blowout.

On another note, I used to hate the mornings (love sleeping in) and I now will wake up in the morning to shower and do my hair so it’s fresh for the day instead of doing it the night before!!

And another great tip, is that if you do go to bed with your hair wet and you wake up and it’s all psycho crazy looking you can actually use the hairdryer brush on dry hair! it just smooths it out and honestly it’s not the same as like wet to dry but it’s better than how you woke up with your hair!! And it’ll take 5 min so you don’t need to waste time straightening it with a hot iron!!

I am an unofficial spokesperson lol but I really think Revlon should start giving me royalties because I’ve gotten all of my friends and coworkers to buy it and you should too!!! You won’t regret it :)",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I’ve used this sucker twice and omg I love it. Super easy to use, my hair doesn’t get caught or tangled in the bristles, and reduces the overall frizz of my hair when I wear it down! One downside is it’s a tad louder than I was expecting. I have a roommate who works opposite hours I do so was concerned about it waking her up, but I just use it on low for a few extra minutes. All around seriously love this product. It fits nicely in my hand and makes my morning stylin’ a breeze!",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"El cepillo llegó más rápido de lo esperado, el mismo día que llegó lo probé y funcionó perfectamente. La recomendación al usarlo es dividir el cabello en secciones, seca más rápido y de esta forma no hay necesidad de poner el cepillo en la temperatura más alta, cuidando tu cabello sin exponerlo a calor innecesario. El único detalle negativo es que la caja llegó rota como si la hubieran abierto, lo que da una impresión de artículo viejo, pero pudo ser culpa del transportista, ya que el cepillo no estaba usado.

"I have fine hair, but a lot of it. I normally have to tease my crown and spend quite a bit of time in order to get my medium length style to do what I want. I decided to try one of these tools to build some volume. Advertisements for L'ange tools are plastered all over Facebook so I naturally checked in to these first. The reviews are mixed on the tool itself and their ratings on BBB were horrible, so I reached out for recommendations on Facebook. Out of at least 10 recommendations, ALL of them were for the Revlon One Step Dryer and Volumizer. I am not a Revlon fan typically for hair tools and I normally would purchase a more expensive brand but I decided to give this a shot. Glad I did!
It got delivered last night and I just used it. This thing is SLICK! I will try it for touch-ups for the next few days, until it's hair washing time again! Loving it so far!",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I can’t say enough great things about this dryer. My stylist recommended to me because I have fine hair, but I love volume. This dryer is so easy to work with, it’s light weigh, the swivel cord never gets tangled up, the high/low/cool/off switch is easy to use and doesn’t get bumped while holding the dryer. My hair dried quickly, with lots of volume and, shockingly, no need to flat iron it to smooth out frizz! It’s a little loud, but I can easily put up with that for all the great features it provides. I highly recommend.",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I really, really wanted to love this product but after 3 uses I had to give up the dream and process a return. If you are thinking of purchasing, you should know the following:

Pros-
1- Great concept and very easy to use.
2- It did add nice volume to my long/layered hair but no more than I can achieve with a blow dryer and round brush.

Cons-
1- It is WAY TOO HOT, even on the low setting. After quickly running the barrel through a small section of my hair, I would catch my hair in my other hand to prepare to run the tool through again. I burned the skin on my hand multiple times by doing this (we are talking about burns that are red and painful for several minutes). If my hair is too hot to the touch after using this, it's definitely not healthy. After 3 uses, I also noticed that my hair was starting to develop split ends.
2- The plastic bristles are falling out and could be a dangerous choke hazard to pets and children if you don't realize that they have fallen on the floor.
3- There is a cool setting that can be used to lock in curls located between the off and low setting. Since the settings are located on a dial on the handle of the tool, it's pretty much impossible to quickly turn to the cool setting while you have your hair wrapped around the barrel. The only way that I could make it work was to turn it all the way to the off position and then on to the cool position which was time consuming.

Overall, I don't recommend this product because I think it is damaging to hair, and in my case, also had defective bristles.",2,2,B01LSUQSB0
"It's only been about a week, but so far I am really liking this! I was just about ready to cut my hair off - always felt frizzy and like it was all split ends. Not any more. My hair feels and looks better and shinier. This takes a bit longer than my hair dryer but I don't have to use the flat iron anymore so overall it probably works out being a little bit quicker. I've also had multiple compliments on my hair since I started using it! It took me a few tries to get the technique down, but it's getting there. The big test will be to see how my hair holds up to the Florida humidity that will be here soon but so far, so good. Might be hard to use on really short hair, but other than that, I highly recommend it.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"This was a big disappointment. It is twice as heavy as my ordinary blow dryer and very awkward to handle. I have shoulder-length hair and the giant oval shape of the barrel did nothing but straighten and flatten my hair. The bristles get very soft and bendy (useless when trying to create volume) as the unit warms up. After trying it at home for a few days, I took it to my hairdresser appointment to see if she had better luck. Nope. It feels like Revlon rushed this into production to compete with higher-end models on the market. It didn’t work for me. It will be in my next box headed to Salvation Army.",1,2,B01LSUQSB0
"This is the best hair appliance I have ever owned! I have thick curly shoulder length hair, it's layered and cut to be worn straight. I would have normally spent about 40 minutes trying to blow dry it out, and another 20 with a 2"" curling iron, and then when I woke up in the morning some of it would have started to curl. I ended up in a ponytail most days. with this hot air brush I now have the hair I always wanted. I dry each section in both directions and 2-5 passes and its dry. It falls so naturally, looks amazingly shiny (it's very processed), and the moisture is locked out. It looks good every morning and if I was to do a bit of a freshen up, I run it all over for 1-2 minutes and it looks great. It literally took 11 minutes to go from wet to dry and styled. I have not used another appliance in almost 2 months.
I was one of those people that kept searching for the right hair tool, with no luck. I have gotten rid of, 1 blow dryer, hot rollers, Velcro rollers, spinning brush thing (tangled my hair). The only drawback is that it's large, so travel wise it will take up room, but it's not heavy like my blow dryer and now it's a pleasure to use. It does go from warm to hot, and it has a cool so you can set it. if you are like me and are hair appliance challenged or don't have 60+ minutes in your day to make sure your hair looks good, this might be your answer. I'm not sure why more people don't talk about it. DONT BUY THE KNOCK OFFS-THEY ARE NOT REGULATED AND DANGEROUS",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"UPDATED REVIEW:
PLEASE listen to the other reviews on here. This product barely lasted me a year - meanwhile my straightener from 2010 (ELEVEN YEARS AGO) still functions just the same. It’s also set off the smoke alarm, so you can imagine how bad that is for your hair - even with heat protectant. Just spend a little more for your hair’s sake, and longevity.

—————————————

LOVE this product:
- it cut down my total hair time (including drying my hair to straightening it) from 1.25 hours to 30 minutes!
- easy to use once you get the hang of it

I knocked off one star only because it doesn't volumize my hair as a salon blowdry does...but that could be user error",1,One,B01LSUQSB0
"It does is easy to use, it does has drying power and all that “good” features but for my super fine hair did not work. It burns my hair and it does not look styled at all when I finished. I tried with my hair wet, not so wet, almost dry, completely dry and no technique worked, always ended up with the flat iron as usual. I feel that if your hair is the kind that you have to blow dry and then finish up with a flat iron then this will help speed the process but if you just need a little style with the flat iron only then this is not for you, you will ended up with burnt and puffy hair",3,2,B01LSUQSB0
"I really loved this blow dryer brush. The first one I bought was amazing. Made my super thick curly hair straight in 30 minutes. I loved it. And then it stopped working. No biggie, so I ordered another one rather than try to argue with the manufacturer. The second one I got, started making weird noises at one point but it still worked so I didn’t make a big deal about it. Fast forward to my birthday this week when I was doing my hair and the blow dryer brush caught on FIRE!!!!! Scared the bejesus out of me and it had to be swiftly thrown out the window to die it’s blaze of inferno death. Now what to do??? This blow dryer brush is amazing when it works, but will it ever work longer than a few months?? And will it always end up bursting into flames?? Sorry Revlon, maybe this needs to go back to the drawing board.",1,2,B01LSUQSB0
"Overall, this hairdryer is bulky and heavy to hold. Not good if you have arthritis or wrist factors. And it does not dry my hair as quickly as previous dryers did. Several times in using this hairdryer, I noticed a burning smell, which was alarming. Then today, while on high speed, I heard a sort of pop or sparking sound, and the whirr of the sound of the motor dropped down to the sound that low speed makes instead of high. I even turned the dial to low and back up to high, and they sounded the same. Again, I got the smell of something burning. Naturally, this happened after the return period is closed. So sorry I looked at the 4.7 stars and the over 35,000 buyers and assumed it meant I would get a useable product.",1,0,B01LSUQSB0
"When I first got this, I used it a lot and liked it even though there was a slight learning curve as someone who never really blow dried my hair before. I have long, curly hair and love any solution to go from wet to straight in just one step. The first few uses, I was blown away. But I guess my thick/tangly hair messed this up a bit because all the bristles are super bent up after just a handful of uses, and when I turn the dryer certain ways and wrap my hair around it, it makes a screaming noise? I haven't used it in weeks because of that and I'd be bummed if I already needed to replace it after a few tries, unless it's user error. I don't really notice the volume or ""blowout"" look that others report, but I just like that it's an easy way to straighten my naturally curly hair straight from the shower. I probably have a lot to learn about how to use this to make it look best but I'm concerned I already broke it",4,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I read that this was rated #1 , out of the 20 that were rated. What a disappointment. I should have done a bit more research. This thing is huge, bulky and heavy. Probably works well with long hair. Mine is medium. The barrel is too large, for me. I found it to be very heavy and hard to maneuver. Awkward and bulky. Next thing is that it only has 2 settings. HOT and cool. The hot is SUPER hot. I definitely won't use this frequently, might end up with damaged hair. I was going to return it but the Amazon return location, UPS store is too far, one employee and I've been twice , waited forty five minutes and left the first time, last time waited over thirty minutes. Forget it, I just kept it. Next time, I will buy the Conair, cheaper and not mammoth .",3,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I, like you, browsed reviews before buying this product. For whatever reason, I was just waiting for one review to pop up that said ""waste of money"" or ""not all it is cracked up to be"". I also have ALWAYS stayed away from anything that even remotely suggested that it would give my hair more volume because it absolutely doesn't need help in the volume department. a friend of mine had raved about this product, and I was still questioned it's potential to help MY hair. My hair is thick & coarse. It demands expensive styling tools, conditioners, and moisturizing hair masks.
I had a gift card, and thought, what the hell. I purchased this on a monday, received it on tuesday, and tried it out as soon as it arrived.
Where has this been all my life?! It took me 20 mins to blow dry/straighten my hair. it usually takes me around 30-45 mins depending on how stubborn my hair decides to be that day, not including blow-dry time! 20 minutes!!! My hair doesn't feel any more volumized than normal, but it feels super soft. I'm thankful I did myself a favor & went for this product. Revlon is not paying me for this review; although, they are more than welcome to if they would like. ha!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Super impressed with the results and 100% happy with my purchase!

While it did not cut my dry time down by much, if at all, I think that was more just trying to get used to it. I’ve been blow drying with a blow dryer and brush for 20 years!
It gets super HOT, so definitely use a heat protectant in your hair. I also used the high setting. For thinner hair, so sure start with the low setting.

If you have thicker hair, you’ll want to take smaller sections. It’ll dry faster and straighter. I found that the One Step also made drying awkward angles much easier to navigate, like the crown of the head.

I loved that I was able to get extra lift at the roots with minimal effort. I did find it didn’t straighten the shorter hair at my temple as well and I needed to use my iron on those small spots. This is a very large barrel, so that is definitely a factor there.

One small issue I had is that it is a little loud, so not something I’d use while my hubs or the kids were sleeping.

I know there are much more expensive versions out there, but I found this worked very well without breaking the bank.",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"So this product normally sells for anywhere between 50 and 60 but I found it here on Amazon for 35! Whaaaat?! (Sorry if you're here after the sale and got it for a higher price....my bad). I snatched that up real quick and was really excited for perfectly blown out hair within 2 days. Thank you, Prime! It arrived at my neighbors house (which I discovered from the lovely pic of my neighbors front door in the email delivery notice) so I rushed over and grabbed it up and ran away back to my house, probably looking like a total thief but worth it for this! Am I right?! Luckily my neighbor didn't notice and I went straight to the bathroom to plug this bad boy in. The power on this thing! Sheesh! It sounded like a Boeing 737 was in my bathroom but no biggie cause my hair was salon smooth and beautiful within 20 min (from being about 80% dry).

There's 3 heat settings; high, low, cool. The high is way too hot. Like burning pits of hell hot so I went with low and, while it took a bit more time than high might have, I had hair on my head (and it looked great) when I was finished so I was happy w that. Overall, I'm impressed! The Price was fantastic.

It is a bit bulky in my hand but I've had thicker things in my hand so no biggie! I know how to handle a good thick instrument. *drops mic*",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I will never ever go back to a round brush and blow dryer again...

So easy and so quick! A great blowout for my thin fine hair in 20 minutes. Left hair shiny and bouncy. Cant imagine a better fifty dollars spent on a styling tool ever. Do it!

The only thing I don’t like about it is the temperature controls being less than ideal... a weird band switch at the base that is just awkward to operate. And the hot setting is hot enough to burn my thin fine hair off if I let it, and the cool setting is not cool, which takes away the efficacy of a nice cool shot after your blowout to add smoothness and shine.

The hot setting is good enough to smooth out some of the coarse kinks in my hair but not for other more stubborn kinks.

Also, it is so big that you cant get close to your roots, and my roots are my main concern because my hair is chemically relaxed and the roots get kinky as it grows out.

But these things are minor compared to the miracle which is this product!!!!!

I am such a lazy person when it comes to beauty and this solved my problem... as a matter if fact i will have to use some restraint; I just blew my hair out yesterday and am already wanting to today!",4,0,B01LSUQSB0
"This combo one-step hairdryer/volumizer gets rave reviews but I'm giving it only 3 stars because it did not meet my particular needs in a one-step application. This is a great appliance for those with hair of a long length or those with curly hair who want to blow-dry and smooth out their tresses without having to wield both a dryer and brush simultaneously. That convenience was what drove me to buy this product. However, I have a shoulder-length layered shag-type haircut that needs a lot of volume on top. While the Revlon combo unit does provide a little volume, it only makes my layers straight and flat because the barrel of the brush is too large to give the necessary curve and height to short layers. I still get better results with my blow dryer and narrower round brush. All those lady vloggers with long hair reviewing the product should have tipped me off, but alas, I was only looking to free one hand. I know there are other combo units out there, but until I get over wasting my money, I'll stick to my tried and true method for now.",3,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I was absolutely BLOWN AWAY (pun intended) the first time I used this dryer. Where has this been my entire life?? I have frizzy, curly, difficult to control hair that I've NEVER been able to blow dry. I always have had to let it air dry in a braid or bun or otherwise it ends up looking like a lion's mane. I could not believe how quickly I was able to dry my hair, and it came out with practically no frizz and was straightened but still had some of its natural wave which looked super pretty. You don't have to worry about burning yourself with this tool either- it doesn't get super hot! I use the tool just like a brush and it feels super soft and gentle against my hair. BUY THIS. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Bought this in April of 2020 and was immediately obsessed. Weird to use the first time but quickly got the hang of it by my second use. What a gorgeous, almost salon-quality blowout for my thick, wavy, kind-of-course hair in under TEN MINUTES. Yes, UNDER 10 minutes! I told all my friends! They all bought one! We were all so happy!

But, it was too good to last. Even with only twice a week use--I estimated I only used it about 40 times from April until September--I started to notice when I would turn it on, the power would come on nice and strong and then decrease briefly, then increase again to normal. I decided to ignore it because I was in denial that my precious hair brush dryer could be breaking, but alas. It was. One day, I turned it on, heard that decrease in power then smelled the telltale burning that told me if I didn't turn it right off, it was going to blow (no pun intended). Naturally, because it was five months later and I hadn't bought the extended warranty I was SOL. Amazon did nothing for me. My bad, I guess. I'm now trying to email Revlon to see if they can send me a new one which will hopefully last longer. If they don't, I'll be exploring a different brand hoping I have better luck, because after being spoiled with this I can't go back to a regular round brush and hairdryer. So, in short, you don't necessarily have to NOT buy it, just toss over a few bucks extra and get that warranty.",2,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I’m not super into doing my hair... it dries very straight on its own, but recently I’ve been trying to put a little more effort into my overall appearance. I bought this awhile ago and then watched a YouTube video to figure out how to use it... I know it seems easy to most, but again, I’m a total beginner when t comes to feminine beauty products. This was very easy to use and made my hair a bit more sleek with more volume. It took about a half hour and I have long, thick hair. I definitely recommend this!",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I could not wait to get this item, but it was a disaster from the beginning. 1st one arrived opened in the product box w/o any packaging inside. Disgusting. The replacement came the next day and I couldn’t wait to try it. So, so disappointed. It’s heavy, bulky, pulls long hair and creates tangled. There are two settings to dry your hair. Hot/High which is very hot! Or Warm/Low which is still hot. No thanks, I’m not frying my hair and wearing my arm out over false hype.",1,2,B01LSUQSB0
"I have been using it for almost 1yr now. It’s quite heavy compared to a conventional dryer. If you have a lot of hair, your hand will get tired after 10mnts. I have long hair and it takes 20 to 30mnts to finish styling. If you have medium curly hair, the low heat setting will not work at all. While styling with low heat setting, you can see the bouncy ness and the curls forming really nice, but the moment you get in your car thinking your hair is all set, it will loose all the styles and bounces in 5mnts! And your hair will turn frizzier than ever before! So, don’t trust the low heat. Always style with high heat. That stays for at least 3-4hrs. Biggest problem is, with high heat setting, the machine is noisy as a beast, almost like a commercial vacuum cleaner! And as this machine is so close to your ears, after 5mnts, your ears will start ringing and become numb! I could not hear normally at least for half an hour after using this styler. Now I use ear buds! It’s totally not healthy. The noise almost made me deaf! The final blow dry look feels really nice but very short termed. Your straightener would give you long term setting, at least for a day or two. And straightener is faster too. But if you want volume, Revlon is better than straightener. It does not work much on dry hair. Your hair needs to be towel dried and 20% wet. The machine works better for the end waves of you keep rotating the machine manually. If you just hold it there, it does nothing. Overall it’s ok, except the heavy weight and crazy noise.",4,0,B01LSUQSB0
"This thing has changed up my morning. I have a long commute so I don’t have a lot of time in the morning. For years my routine was to wash my hair at night then do a quick straighten in the morning which still left frizz! I got this Revlon styler and the time it saves is unbelievable. I can wash, dry and style my hair in 20 minutes max! My hair is so much shinier because I didn’t have to sleep on it after washing it the night before. This dryer does get very hot on the highest setting, so recommend you start it out on low and see what your hair can tolerate. I have very thick hair, so I crank it to the highest setting and go for it! In 20 minutes I’m ready and out the door. This baby is worth every penny. 10/10 recommend!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I have wavey/frizzy and color treated medium length hair and have always been good about using the appropriate and necessary products (ie conditioning oils, thermal spray, etc). I wanted to love this product because of the reviews and convenience, but every single time I use it, it gets SO HOT like cannot even touch it or my hair. It literally fried my hair right off - Like smoke and burning hair, everything.. So then I started drying my hair half way with my normal blow drier so I wouldn't need to go over the same pieces so many times with the one-step hair drier, but still, it completely burned my hair. I have chunks missing. I really am wondering if this is a faulty product because no one else seems to have the smoke coming from the hair when I watch them use it in videos or Instagrams. I can't return it because it's too late, as I took too long to try to make it work.",1,3,B01LSUQSB0
"Overall, love. I’m terrible at using the brush while I blow dry my hair with a traditional blow dryer. So I have just blow dryed and hoped for the best, and curled over it if it was something I wanted to look nice for. I’m lazy, so this was rare. I pay a lot to get my hair cut and colored, so it’s a shame to always wear it up or just blow dryed with no style to it. With this revlon brush, I look like I got a salon blow out and. It only took maybe a minute or two longer to dry my hair than my normal blow dryer, but the styling was great. I wait until my hair is about 25% dry (not dripping wet) from the shower to then start with this. It is a big round brush, so I was worried about being able to get it dry close enough to the root. It was a little hard, but all worked out.
I will tell all my girlfriends about this!",5,2,B01LSUQSB0
"I love this thing. I've never managed to learn how to use a hair dryer and a round brush so this product is a great and easy to use combination of the two. I have long, thick hair and it dries quicker than if i were to blow dry it by itself and with considerably less frizz. If i were to just blow dry, i'd have to also straighten because of frizz, but this is truly one step. Only downside is that the hot setting is HOT HOT. Definitely use a heat protectant and consider trying it on the low setting if you do it every day because i have noticed some damage. but i'll still use it.",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I Have naturally curly hair and have never been able to just blow dry my hair. I have attached a photo of what that looks like (very poofy). Any time I want to straighten/curl my hair I have to blow dry it, then straighten it, and then curl it if I decide to. It takes way too much time and has left me leaving my hair natural, which is fine but it takes a long time to dry and sometimes I just don’t want 6 hours of wet hair. I have never even considered a world where I could just do one, and now I’m living in it. I highly recommend this product to anyone and everyone that blow dries daily or even just does straight hair on occasion. I’m shocked by how soft and straight my hair is. I used blow dry cream before and some oil after, and my hair is even softer than it is when I flat iron it. It still has body and isn’t flat to my head. I can’t believe how easy it was to use. The pictures speak for themselves.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I buy anything and everything on Amazon. I mean EVERYTHING. I'm an amazon and beauty junkie and I read thousands of reviews. I won't keep anything unless it changes my life significantly for the better. I return A LOT of what I buy. But this product has changed my life. I have thick, curly hair. I was frying it from constant blow drying and flat ironing. But this product did in under 10 minutes what both a blow dryer and flat iron couldn't do in 40 minutes, and with no damage. It takes my super curly unruly hair to the silkiest, smoothest state it has ever been in my life in minutes. I am honestly blown away. When I say, best purchase ever, I'm serious. Buy this and never look back.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Ok, pros and cons. This thing does cut your time in half if not more. My hair is to my butt and thick and it took about 22 minutes from soaking wet to do my entire head. So it DOES work. It takes a few min to adjusted to the size of the thing though. It's not overly heavy. I wish there was a textured grip on it though because my hand slipped while turning it a few times. My hair didnt have volume after i was done. In fact it was almost like a straightener had been used on my head. I know how to do my hair! And I focused on trying to get volume at the top near my roots and face and instead my hair was clinging to my face and very straight. Overall I do suggest this product. Its DOES work and is very efficient. But I'd be careful around the roots at the top and face because it straightened and flattened my hair too much.",4,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I was very hesitant on purchasing this. Had it in my cart like a thousand times but always hit save for later. Well I finally bought it and my ONLY complaint is the cramp I get in my thumb when I use it! I have never been able to give myself a salon quality blowout. And it’s so fast! Best hair tool I’ve ever purchased! Better than my Beachwaver curling iron ($129) & my bio ionic curling iron ($150). So happy I finally bought it! I have thin mid length, curly frizzy fuzzy hair. I usually give up trying to blow it out because it takes too long, I can never get it smooth at the root and my arms feel like they’re gonna fall off. Not anymore! My hair comes out sleek, smooth and it feels soft & silky in like 10 minutes! Love it!",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"When I found this hairdryer/brush, I was ecstatic. I have long hair, so to just find a large brush was a find. With Prime, I got it overnight too. When I opened the box, other than the appliance, there were no instructions. With long hair, I use leave-in oil and conditioners, so I have to clean the brush often. I contacted Revlon and they said ""We recommend make sure the product is unplugged use a damp cloth with soap and water and do the same with a QTip and run it in between the bristles and clean the handle."" I'd have to have a subsidy to fund my Q-tips for the number of bristles on this brush!! I am really disappointed in their product engineers that they couldn't design either a removable unit with the bristles, or a detachable head piece. I returned it unused. I'm sure it works well, but because of the design flaw, I'm giving it a 3 rating.",3,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Let me first state that every time I've had my hair done at the salon, I always walk away wishing the stylist would come to my house every day and blowdry my hair. I can never blowdry my hair the same way they do. I also have a hard time blowdrying my hair because I have muscle weakness in my arms and it's a strain on my arms to keep them up above my head. Depending on how I'm feeling will depend on if I have the energy to take on styling my hair. Often times, I just put it up in a ponytail or pull it back with clips. Well, my sister told me about this product and I figured I would try it. It's a two in one so that eliminates me having to hold the dryer and a brush so that's a plus right there. I tried blowdrying my hair this morning and let me tell you, I look like I just stepped out of the salon! Yes, and I did it! Actually, this Revlon dryer did it and it did create some volume that I desire. I can't say enough good things about this product and I'm so happy to have found something that will motivate me to try and style my hair more often.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I have naturally curly hair, none of that wavy hair, I have spirals wet or dry. And when I started using this instead of my normal blow dryer and straightener (I don't like the roll brush) it left my hair nice and smooth but the issue i had was my hair is frizzy. I used product in my hair to eliminate the frizz and never had the issue with my normal routine. The temperature for the high setting is too hot and makes my face and ears super red. Takes me hours to cool myself back down. I had to run my hair down with a flat iron.",3,One,B01LSUQSB0
Received item with hair already in it. I’m trying to get another one to try but I’m have problems receiving the replacement.,1,12,B01LSUQSB0
"I love this product! It dries my hair quickly and leaves it feeling extremely soft and shiny. My hair is damaged from using bleach and when I let it air dry, or even dry it with a normal blow dryer, it feels very dry and crunchy. Also, it doesn't solve my frizz problem. Using this Revlon dryer takes me about 10 minutes and my hair is perfectly straight and shiny. It stays that way until my next wash.

I only have two complaints about this product. One, it doesn't volumize my hair at all. This isn't necessarily a problem as it doesn't make my hair flatter either. Volume level is the same as if I use a regular dryer. Second complaint is that my first one died after about a year, so I had to re-purchase the item a second time. However, it cuts down so much time from my morning routine on hair wash days, so for me the purchase is worth it.

(My hair type is thin hair with a slight wave/texture.)",4,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I like the one handed use and if you have thinner hair I think it would dry and straighten at the same time. I have thick hair and the bristles are too short. I also had to use a regular hair dryer first to dry the roots and a flat iron after to straighten my only partially straightened hair. That was not the reason for the rating. I hovered between 2 & 3 stars because after about four uses it started to emit a burning smell after about 2 minutes of use. I’ve cleaned out the hair stuck in the brush but it made no difference. I tried using it for two minutes, turning it off, flat ironing that section and then turning it back on but it smells like something is burning each time I turn it on. I’m past the 30 day return window so I’ve wasted $50. It did initially make the drying/straightening process a bit faster but it’s not worth buying another to see if I got a “lemon.”",3,2,B01LSUQSB0
"Wow! First picture is the most recent I have of how my hair would dry naturally for context. I have very thick, curly hair. I almost never give myself a blowout because of how hard it is and how long it takes. I like to straighten it from time to time because my hair can hold about 3-4 days between washes and it’s easiest to maintain when it’s straight. This was so easy to use even though I probably didn’t towel dry it enough before I started. it did take several passes through each section (10ish passes per section, separated into 3 layers) and I think the result is amazing! My hair usually looks poofy like this the first day after wash but will look sleeker after the first day. Be careful as on high it does get hot, so be careful with how long your fingers or face are close to the barrel. I’m definitely excited to make this part of my routine!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I have found the holy Grail of drying/stylers! I have thick, long, color treated hair. It takes FOREVER to dry naturally and a long time to dry with a hairdryer. It is naturally wavy a little frizzy and a lot poofy.

I have used a number of similar products in the past but this one surpasses them all. I find with these types of dryers they don't get hot enough to do a great job, they do just an ok job. The temp on this is hot! So hot that I scalded my thumb, on my hair. Which wasn’t pleasant but it meant I found a dryer finally hot enough! I used it on high but there are low and cool settings as well.

The bristles on this are harder and the oblong barrel allows you to get closer to the scalp and pulls it in an upwards motion because of its shape so you get the volume you’re looking for.

I dried my hair with the blow dryer haphazardly until it was damp, not soaking wet, I feel like using it with soaking hair would take me too long. Drying it a little first, this blow out took me MAYBE 10-15 min total.

Some people complained that it’s too huge to hold. I had zero problems with that. I rarely needed 2 hands and if I did it was to hold the tip for a second to do a curl on the end. Are freakishly small handed people complaining about that?

Overall I can’t rave enough about this, it was worth every penny and if it breaks I will buy another in a heartbeat.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Omg, I am in love! I have very thick hair that frizzes easily and has a natural wave. Typically, I have to blowdry my hair and flat iron it in order to stop my hair from getting wavy and to attempt to keep the frizz at bay. This device gives you so much more control than a blowdryer. I wish I had bought this BEFORE I spent $100 on a nice blowdryer. Granted, the blowdryer works nicely, but this hot brush is not only cheaper but leaves my hair feeling soft and smooth! I do recommend pairing this with a boar's head brush as well for best results. This is definitely worth the money and it has exceeded expectations! I decided to make the purchase after my friend used her hot brush on me that cost $100. I was hoping I could acheive the same results for a fraction of the price and this is it!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"A dryer I can use on my hair. I have super thick hair, and it is half curly, half straight, which is super annoying. I let my hair air dry for maybe 20 minutes, then I take this to it, and end up with beautiful straight waves and I can add a nice curl at the end with this. Only takes like 10 minutes to dry my hair, and with a regular hair dryer it takes 30. I literally just decided I don't need my hair dryer anymore, I gave it to goodwill. This is pretty big, so not great for traveling if you want to travel light, and it can be a bit cumbersome to get the hang of, but it is a game changer for me. No more frizzy hair all over the place! It is SO SMOOTH AND SOFT AND NO TANGLES when I use this. I don't even have to brush it for two days after I use this, the results are so lovely.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"We purchased the original one in 2019 and it was an instant success!! My daughter loved it so much that over Christmas break while visiting family all the ladies have it a try and all 6 ordered them! The first one died after 10 months. There second one was ordered on August 12 and today October 8 it has died. Only my daughter used this 2-3 times a week to dry her average shoulder length hair. My hair dryer that I use 5 days a week is over three years old and the one before that was over 5 years old. These simply have not lasted..Maybe we just somehow received two bad ones. It does work really well, just does not last. Totally disappointed. Be wary, unfortunately.",1,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I did not know I needed this...until my awesome hairdresser was talking about a blow dryer styler brush that’s amazing for $500 and always sold out. I got on Amazon and found this with the great reviews. I’ve used it twice. Love it. Both times with wet hair. Normally I always have to use a straightener after I blow dry, takes about 12 minutes to do my hair. With this it took 6 minutes. I’m telling everyone about it. I feel pretty.",5,4,B01LSUQSB0
"This products is alright, it does some things well but overall I think I would have been happier with a different product.

Pros:
I have a lot of thick, wavy, frizz-prone hair. I used to let it air-dry (which takes a few hours), but it would turn into a big poofy mess. When I use this, I can dry and style my hair in about 20 minutes and it’s nice and smooth! I’ve been using it every day for the past 2 months and haven’t had any issues with the cord, like some of the other reviews mention.

Cons:
This thing is HUGE. It’s big and clunky and definitely takes up way more room than a round brush. I couldn’t even fit it in my bathroom drawer. Also, the oval shape is really weird and makes it difficult to shape my hair/add volume. I think a round shape would be better - all the oval shape seems to do is make my hair flat. It’s especially hard to style my bangs with this because of the size and shape.",3,One,B01LSUQSB0
I don’t usually leave reviews but after using this I am so impressed so here goes. This gets hot really hot there is steam coming off your hair it’s amazing and so easy to use even with arthritis in my wrist. I have very thick hair and lots of it and it takes forever to dry but not anymore I actually look forward to washing my hair now as the drying is not a chore. The heat dries hair quickly and sets the style at the same time just a word of warning hold it out as far from your head as you can or may end up feeling burned from the hot air - I was not paid to leave this review just a regular consumer who found something that actually really works well.,5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"Ok, here’s the deal...I’m OBSESSED with this hair dryer. I bought one about 6 months ago and love, love,love it, SO I bought a 2nd one recently to use while I travel for work (I travel for a living). The 2nd hair dryer was defective. Right out of the box it had some electrical problems, turning on/off intermittently and smelled horrible like it was burning inside! I was afraid it was going to catch on fire. I barely was able to use it 3 times before it quit altogether. I LOVE my 1st one so I obviously got a defective one the second time around. Well, I returned it with no issues but was worried about replacing it through Amazon so I went to a local store that begins with W and ends with mart and picked one up for $29.99. My final review would be, get this hair dryer because it’s fantastic but be aware that like everything else MADE IN CHINA, you could possibly get a bad one.",1,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I LOVE this dryer!! I have two left thumbs when it comes to blow drying my hair and I also have the flu at the moment so if I can do it you can too!
I followed some recommendations I saw on YouTube....your basics- dry hair to about 80% (I used my old dryer for that), use a little Moroccan Oil and section off the hair.
Dryer is surprisingly very quiet and works quickly but not to the point that I felt it was frying my hair- I used it on low. I have small hands so I was concerned about the size and awkwardness off the unit but honestly it felt so natural and easy!!",5,3,B01LSUQSB0
"Yes, yes, yes! Buy this. For real. It has completely replaced my blow dryer and sometimes my straightener too. I have the finest, limpest hair (although there is a lot of it) and this actually gives it a bit of oomph. It tends to do a little bit of everything when I let it go natural. Some pieces curl, some are pin straight, and some are wavy, so I feel the need to do something to my dry hair, whether that's curl or straighten it just so it is all on the same page. However, if I do a good thorough blow out with the brush dryer, I can get away with just that, so it saves me styling time. If you are on the fence, go for it. The drying power is awesome. I was worried that I would have to start with an actual blow dryer and then come in with this afterwards, but not the case! It does it all. And quickly, too!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"So, I really love what this tool does to my hair, I have super thick medium length wavy hair and this thing dries my hair in 15 minutes, the only problem, this is the 2nd one I buy in six months! The first one broke, it just turned off and never turned on again, I threw it away because I bought it at target and didn’t save the receipt. I bought a 2nd one on December 16 through Amazon and it is now making a very weird noise, I think is about to stop working, if it breaks I will send it back and won’t buy again. I use it everyday since I wash my hair daily but I don’t think it should break this quick. Anyone else having this issue?",1,2,B01LSUQSB0
"I really wanted to love this product. I mean, how convenient would this be if it worked like some of the reviews say. First off, it’s heavy. Like I get it’s a dryer and brush in one but didn’t expect it to be that heavy. Secondly, idk if it’s because I have very fine hair but it just makes it a frizzy mess! I tried drying it under, drying it rolling down the hair, with product, without...the reviews had me expecting it to smooth out my hair not make it a frizzy mess! So disappointed bc I really wanted to love it!",2,One,B01LSUQSB0
"Holy volume and smoothness, Batman! For reference I have very, VERY thick, wavy and frizzy hair that will retain moisture all day if I dont blow dry it and then in the Florida humidity I look like a Pomeranian. I recently went from dark brown hair to blonde and then to Flamingo Pink so my hair was stressed. I tried this one evening and I couldnt believe the volume and control I had! Be warned it is super loud in a small bathroom and if you have thick hair you need to work in layers but other than that I am pleased. I will be using this daily for sure. I used Honest Company Detangler and Pantene Heat Protectant Spray with this machine. Several thumbs up!!!!!",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
I bought this for myself after Christmas and Im pretty glad I did. My hair looks so nice after and it saves time on drying and then straightening. It is bigger than I expected which came make it hard to hold. I recently cut my hair short so the back is hard to maneuver with such a large brush. It doesn’t add a ton of volume to my hair though. I tend to wash and dry my hair at night and style in the morning but I will definitely use this before events where I wash and style right before.,4,One,B01LSUQSB0
"This was a solid 'okay' for me. I've watched tutorials and tried different ways of using it, but after a few weeks of dedicated use I'm still just not that impressed. The drying on my admittedly very fine hair still takes longer than a normal dryer. The bristles are a little too stiff and end up breaking my hair rather often. I've noticed a lot more hair in this hot brush than is left in a normal round brush when using the traditional round brush and hairdryer combo. Overall I'm not mad I have it and will use it every now and then, but wouldn't recommend. If nothing else, it's a bit heavy and bulky.",3,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I love the swivel cord and this makes drying/straightening my long, think hair much easier and faster. Exactly what I was looking for to replace my old way of using a brush and hair dryer separately. The only downside is that it gets extremely HOT...like burn your scalp HOT. It has 3 settings: Low (which is low-flow but still extremely hot) High (which is high-flow and extremely hot) and Cool (which is high-flow and more like regular hot/warm temp). My thick hair can handle the heat and this tool is so hot it almost could replace my straightener (except for that shiny, sleek look you get from a straightener). The heat is too much for my teenagers so they use the Cool setting which, like I said, is more like warm/hot. Still a great tool and a fair price.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Love, love, love, love, love this thing! I let my hair grow back out this past year. It’s naturally wavy-curly, fairly thick, and can be frizzy. I usually just throw it up in a ponytail because a round brush is not easy to use at this length, and no matter what brush I use to dry my hair with, I have to follow up with a flat iron to smooth it out, and who has that kind of time? This awesome product is a game changer! I washed my hair early this morning, added my usual product, then put it up in a jaw clip while I puttered around. I ended up leaving my hair up in the clip until noon, so it had a pretty good wave in it too. I had just received this dryer yesterday, so I unboxed it and gave it a try. 10 minutes! That’s all it took to have straight, smooth hair. No frizz. No wave. Perfect straight hair! My only slightly negative feedback is that the handle is large and it tired out my arm a couple of times, but it wasn’t that bad. To straighten hair, you need heat and tension. A skinnier handle probably wouldn’t hold up. Maybe a gel grip would be an improvement? On high, my hair got hot so I broke out my heat resistant glove. The low setting worked well on the less curly areas of my hair. A workaround might be to switch the setting to cool at the end which is a good idea anyway to set the style, eliminate frizz, and add shine. No more messy ponytail for me on days I have to go into the office. :)",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Ok, I was skeptical. I have very long, very thick, curly hair. I have never been able to blow dry my hair as my hair ends up looking like a lions mane. I usually wash my hair and let it hair dry over night, them straighten it. The straightener is very rough on my hair. At the suggestion of my hair stylist, I tried this product. I took it to the gym with me, and I figured if it didn't work, it would just be a pony tail type of say. I was SO SURPRISED. I washed my hair at 6:05. By 6:20 my hair was blow dried straight without looking like Mufasa. My favorite part was that I was able to do my bangs and curl the ends and I never had to pull out my straightener. They only thing I don't like is there is no option for a quick cool shot. You have to change the entire setting on the blow dryer. I've gotten used to it the more I've used it, but it was hard to get used to. This product has been a game changer for me getting ready for the day!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Even with salons safely reopening, I’m just not comfy sitting in one for 4+ hours to get a keratin treatment for the summer. I have lots of medium curls but very fine hair and frizz is extremely hard to control without keratin in the humid climate I live in. My hair stylist suggested this product and I’m stunned! It styled my hair smooth and sleek in less than half the time of my normal blowout and there is tons of bounce to it thanks to that way the brush is curved. My only complaint or caution is that the high setting on thus brush is extremely hot and I wasn’t being careful and touched where I shouldn’t have. Ouch. One other thing worth mentioning is the placement of the on/off/temperature control is is down at the very end of the handle where you’re not likely to accidentally hit it. I struggle with some dryers with the switches right on the handle. I’m very happy so far!!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Update:
2nd use and worked better than 1st time & does get easier...
Took between 15-20 min
Length is right above bra line~
In am sure after next trim will take less time
Best product by far!!!!

Works miracles
Granted have only used once so far~
& hair has held up beautifully the next day...
It looks better than going to the salon if I don't say so myself
No curls - I will need to add them if I want them
But for straight blow dry & blow out
It was amazing & saves my arms (especially after being in car accident) that is a God send~
Is a bit heavy at times had 2 use 2 hands
But totally worth it!!!!!!
Hence the 4 ****",4,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Firstly, I have thick, boob length hair that is naturally curly but I prefer to straighten it. I love this dryer!! It gives my hair natural body and shine, controls my curl (straightens the lengths and adds bend to the ends, without losing the body in my hair the way my flatiron does) and it’s so easy to use. My only complaints include the fact that the labels on the temperature controls wear off quickly so it’s hard to tell what temp you’re using, and also, the high temp is far too hot in my opinion. I only use the middle temp (which for some reason isn’t as powerful as the other 2 heat settings) because I don’t want to damage my hair with such high heat. Beyond those issues, this dryer is awesome and it has changed the way I style my hair.",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"Let me start off my saying I have a lot of hair. Big, Curly, Greek hair. I bought this to try it out and after using it for a couple of months here and there this is what I’ve found: For my type of hair, it would ideally provide more heat to straighten it more efficiently and keep it that way, especially over night. It seems to provides about half of the heat a typical salon blow out would feel to have, and in line with that, needs about double the amount of touch ups the following days. With a really good salon blow out, or when I straighten my hair using an iron, I require little touch up the following days. But with this I practically need to do my whole head from the start and re touch it all. If I use this the same day of washing my hair, it does NOT completely straighten it. It takes A LOT of effort and time. On the second it’s better, and finally on the third when I re touch it and my hair has enough oil to keep it down, it works well and looks great. Overall, good, easy to use, but not hot enough for thick curly hair.",4,One,B01LSUQSB0
"So the first time I used this product I was not impressed and was going to return but then I thought I'd give it a little longer. It never got my hair to the point that I didn't need to do atleast a quick once over with a straightener, it was still a little frizzy. It took about as much time as my blow-dryer but was heavier and more awkward. The only thing it was good for was it smoothed out the waves I have in the back of my head that sometimes stays wavy even with my straightener. Oh and it gets SUPER hot and it burned my neck pretty bad. After a month I'm returning as my hair was getting frizzier and frizzier with each use, pretty sure it's damaging the **** out of it.",2,0,B01LSUQSB0
It did work good I have thick long spiral curly hair I’m mixed half white half black and it cut my blow drying time in half It Used to take me over an hour to blow dry my hair with the a standard blow dryer and a roll brush but once I got this it took me 30 mins and that’s on DAMP hair. The only CON IS I purchased the product on April 14 and yesterday June 2nd while using the product it just turned off and will not turn back on smh! I didn’t even really use it like that I have used it about 5x since I bought it and I haven’t had it long either and of COURSE I went to duke for a return and exchange and it’s not longer eligible smh! And I refuse to re buy the product because who knows if the other one with have a wiring defect and do the same!! Sucks because I really did like This blow dryer. Be cautious when buying it may only last you 5 uses and die on you like mines did,1,2,B01LSUQSB0
"I wasn’t sure about this drying straightener at first. I have a friend who swears by it. I tried it again yesterday and fell in love with it. My hair looked amazing and still does today. I have thick curly hair. It doesn’t straighten my hair as straight as a traditional straightener does, however it leaves some of the wave in and takes down all the frizz and curls. The only reason I gave it a four star is the temperature. There is cool, med, high. High is hot hot...I couldn’t use this near my scalp or neck, or touch my hair right after. Medium is hot. I need to put my hand to block the hot air from my skin. But this is manageable. Cool is warm, I am not sure cool enough to “lock” in the hair. This aside, I definitely recommend the product.",4,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I was hesitant to buy this product because it is pricey and I did not know if I was going to like it or if it would do what I needed it to do. But my niece bought it first and she loved it so I bought it too. The delivery was fast but I did not have time to use it until today and I love it. I had to use the lower heat setting because my hair is thin and the high one was too much. I felt the hair not getting damage as much as when I Use the hair straightener, and I love the way my hair looks, it is a bit frizzy but I did not put any products on my hair and it was my first time using it. But once I get the hang of it I know it would look even better. I did give a fours start to the easy to use feature because it is kind of bulky but other than that great product worth every penny I am just sorry I did not buy it before.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
Buyer Beware - as much as I love this product I recently started to notice that my hair was thin and I was getting almost bald patches in some areas. I immediately went to see my doctor - since we all think the worst - and my hormone levels and other bloodwork indicated I was fine. Told my hairdresser about it and we went thru things and the only change I have made is using this blow dryer. I love this product but I don’t think it is made for long term use. I have been using it twice a week since August 2018. Going to give it a rest for about six months and hoping hair grows back. Will keep you posted.,1,4,B01LSUQSB0
"I’ve always struggled with getting more volume out of my hair. Just wants to lay super flat! My blow dryer needed replacing, so figured I would give this blow dryer / brush combo a try. The quality is good and I enjoy the “squishiness” of the brush so I don’t accidentally whack myself in the head (yes, I’m clumsy like that). The end is cool so you don’t burn your hand - just wish that part was a little bigger or more grippy. Overall I enjoy using the brush, but it didn’t add any volume unfortunately. I’m sure there is more I could do on my end, but I’m just not super savvy when it comes to hair. Anyway, good brush, good blower, works pretty good.",4,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Love this! I’d seen a very glowing review on Instagram for this Revlon product and it was significantly cheaper than other similar dryer brushes. I have fine hair and not much of it, just past shoulder length. I got great volume that actually lasted through “three sleeps” and it was much easier than using a brush and a hair blower. Because I don’t have the ton of hair I used to have (thank you hormones...) my scalp is a bit more sensitive to heat, and I think I can stick to the lower heat setting on this dryer, which is fine. The blowing power is quite strong, so if you have lots of hair, with the higher heat setting, you’re gonna have full, dry hair pretty quickly. It’s a little on the heavy side which took a little getting used to, but it’s a great hair styling tool overall.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I have so many friends who absolutely LOVE this tool. So, of course, I had to buy one! Pros: adjustable heat settings, easy to use with just one hand/arm. Cons: Plastic barrel is not as effective as a ceramic or metal barrel for straightening hair; and, while I didn't use mine enough to actually have this problem, I do think the plastic is a bit thin and probably would not last long in my house. *IMPORTANT TO NOTE* My hair is very long -- nearly down to my waist. It is also somewhat thick and has some waves. My biggest problem with this dryer is that it did not effectively straighten my hair. Again, I believe a ceramic or metal barrel would have helped solve this problem. I used it 3-4 times. I liked the overall concept, but was not pleased with the results.",3,3,B01LSUQSB0
I bought this brush from a different vendor. I have ethnic hair that is tight curly combination tighter kinky hair. This dries the hair very quickly but it made it a straight out Afro. It also made my hair have a smell like it was burnt. It was unmanagable hair and very disappointed. I am not sure but I think that the Ionic part is not compatable with very kinky curly hair. My hair does much better with a metal roll brush and a good regualr hair dryer on hot. Also this thing only has two settings. One is low and the othe is blast your ears off.,1,2,B01LSUQSB0
"I got this during Prime Day for around thirty dollars. I have long, thick (lots of) hair with a fine texture. With a regular hair dryer, I would comb through my wet hair, use traditional hair dryer, and comb back through dried hair. I would have hair all over the bathroom, and it took a good 20 minutes total. With this Revlon dryer, I comb my hair, and then it combs it for me as it dries. Plus, I don't have hair all over my bathroom, and I don't have to comb back through my hair when I'm done. It takes me maybe 8 minutes to be totally done now!
Cons: The tool is heavier than my hair dryer, but it only took 2 uses to get used to the new weight. You do have to clean your hair out of the bristles which is no big deal. My hair does get so hot that I can't touch it for a few seconds when I have it on high. But, I wash and use conditioner every day, and my hair stylist said she sees no heat damage to my hair whatsoever. So I'm calling this a winner!!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
OK.....after reading the reviews...I had to try this...I have very fine hair. Its humid in NY. 1. You MUST put a smoothing/heat protectant on your hair. 2. It is NOT good for short bangs. 3. It works great however....your hair gets very very hot to the touch. 4. You really need it on the high heat setting to get the full smooth blow out look. 5. I wash my hair twice a week. I would NOT use this twice a week...I can see it doing some damage. If you have somewhere special to go or photos etc etc...YES this is amazing!!! Just not every time you dry your hair.,4,One,B01LSUQSB0
"The product itself is amazing but I was very super disappointed how it was shipped. It was not put in a shipping box to protect the actual display one. This is a xmas gift and they wrote all over the box not to mention put the actual shipping label on the box. Now how am I suppose to gift it in the original package? It looks horrible, beat up & not presentable at all. Like seriously who does that? Future shipping have some thought in the process to think that, that could be a gift!!!",5,2,B01LSUQSB0
Unit seems to work well but I feel like it is burning my hair and the handle and end of the dryer gets very hot! I am avoiding use because of this. Was also hoping that my daughters could use this however it is just too hot that I worry about safety.,2,5,B01LSUQSB0
"It’s Everything I wanted this to be! It takes me 5-8 min to blow dry and straighten my fine-medium longer length hair with this tool. The brush makes it super easy to shape hair how I want and the process is so fast. I feel like I can finally style my hair like the salon does. I was never good at using the big roll brush while drying, but I can definitely do it now with this tool. I’m very glad I made this purchase.",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"This is hands down THE BEST PURCHASE I have made. I even went back and bought TWO more as gifts for my family/friends. If I had more money I would buy more and gift them to every woman I know. I am beyond happy with this product.

For starters, it is lightweight and ergonomically comfortable to hold.

The drying power is amazing. I have long hair and this tool cuts down my drying and styling time to half!

My hair is left shiny and I can curl the ends easily and they're smooth and sleek.

Using a hair dryer and a separate brush left my arms achy but this bad boy prevents that.

BUY IT, YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED and if you are..... send it to me! LOL.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0

 I’m so shocked how well this worked on my hair. It really is like having a professional blowout done at the salon. My hair is shoulder length so I wasn’t sure if the dryer would be too big. It’s lightweight and easy to use. My hair is frizzy and coarse but it is straight, shiny, and has lot of volume. If you’re on the fence about buying this, don’t be! It’s a great tool and I never had to touch my hair with a flatiron.",5,3,B01LSUQSB0
"This is a magical machine. My hair texture changed a few years back and I started having extremely frizzy, curly hair after having 30 years of poker straight hair. I had no idea what to do with it. I tried the curly girl method, which was fine but I didn't like the look on myself. Always flat at the top (even properly pinning and diffusing) and crazy, bulky curls from the ears down. I am far too lazy to straighten my hair everyday or even twice per week. I tried braids, ponytails, curling irons, wavers, straighteners, every product known to man. And I was in tears at the amount of work I was putting into bad hair. THEN THIS MAGICAL THING CAME INTO MY LIFE. I take a shower, get out and make breakfast, apply my makeup, get dressed, get my kids off to school, etc. After about an hour or so of that, my hair is 70% dry and I start in with this dryer. I pin the top half up and work in 4 small-ish sections per layer. About 30 seconds to 1 minute per section. My hair is done in 10 minutes tops. It looks like I stepped out of a salon every day. And I use zero products. AMAZING. My hair is smooth and has so much volume. If you want next day hair, lightly spritz it all over with water and do it again. I will never use another tool again!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Update: after 8 months the dryer made a popping sound and started smelling like burnt wires. I was sad because this is my go to styling tool and I love it. I couldn’t spend another $60 on it, so I reached out to the seller. (Note: I lost my job during the pandemic and couldn’t afford to purchase another and had several video interviews lined up)
They were amazing! They responded to my email in 48 hours and asked for the serial number and picture. Within 24 hours they confirmed my warranty and shipped out a new replacement! I just got it back and it love my hair again. Thanks so much for the amazing customer service.

This is great! I love the look of a blow out but I’m horrible with a brush and dryer. This literally takes me 5-10 minutes to style my hair. 10 minutes if its damp and 5 if it’s dry.
I have a lot of hair. Not only is it thick but is also half way down my back. I naturally have wavy hair and this helps me look out together in no time. This is important since I have a 1 year old and have to get ready fast.
Make sure you are buying the Revlon and not a generic one. I initially got the generic and it was damaged, smelled like burn wires and didn’t work as well. The generic also died after 1st use. So definitely go with the name brand.
It’s loud but I only use it for a short time, so I don’t mind it",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I’ve had this for over 8 months. High humid environment.
+Easy to use, provides big volume, and dries quickly. I used it on my shoulder length straight , flat hair. It vavoomed my hair at the root, straightened flyaways on the sides, and curled hair beautifully on the ends. From damp hair to styled and dry in less than 10 min (I can drive to work with damp hair and Air dry in 30min). Hairstyle stayed in w/o hair product all day. I used the cool high setting. So awesome!!
Used it on my daughter’s thick curly hair (loose ringlets) to see how well it straightened. From damp, it took 20-30 min. It was straight w/some wave (so if you want perfectly straight, need a quick flat iron run over it). No hair products.

-no real issues. This probably wouldn’t work great with hair under an inch (I have some breakage at my part that this will only dry vs style).",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Where has this product been all my life? I have thick, wavy hair that I thought I knew how to blow dry until I got this product. Getting a beautiful blow out has never been easier since I started using this hair drying brush. It honestly gives me salon quality blow outs ... even my hair stylist was impressed. I usually let my hair air dry a bit before I use it. As I said, I have thick hair so using it on wet hair straight out of the shower would take a long time. But once my hair is air dried about 10 minutes, this dryer gets my style done so fast and easy. I love it! Don't delay, get this!",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I can't stop raving about this hair dryer. I have frizzy hair, and even blowing it dry and straightening it before, I'd still end up with frizz if I went outside. Not only does this hair dryer get the job done in 5-15 minutes, which is much faster than my multi-step process from before, but so far (fingers crossed!), I haven't had any frizzing up after, even without using products! My hair is so sleek and soft, and so easy to style. I'm just in love with it. The price is great too. My only wish is that it had a few more temperature settings, like a lower heat (I think the low on this is the same temperature, just lower blowing), but otherwise I am super content.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I LOVE this ! I have thick curly hair and blow drying then straightening is such a process. This cuts the time in half. I do still need to run a straightener through it because it’s a little fluffy but it’s so worth it. I have to admit I was skeptical, my hair generally just ends up in a frizzy mess with fancy tools but this is different. Don’t let the volume word scare you, if you put it over the hair instead of under and brushing up it’s no different than a blowout.",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"PROS: I really love this. I typically use a straighter or curling wand daily. But everyday I can give myself a salon quality (if not better) blow out! I’m not a hop out of the shower and dry soaking wet hair kind of girl so using this on slightly air dried or just towel dried hair is how I do it! I have even gone to bed with a wet head woken up with it dry and used it to style my dry hair in the morning. I have shoulder length thick layered hair.

CONS: the highest heat gets HOT. I use that at my roots then switch it up between high and low. I do like the cool setting to set the style.
I’m not sure this will last the 4 year manufacture warranty. It’s really loud! And you can’t clean the hair around it off too easily.

I have definitely enjoyed it. I use it on my daughters short bob wavy hair too, and it comes out adorable.

I say go for it while it’s $20 off!!",4,0,B01LSUQSB0
"So I would say, if you are looking for a quicker way to dry your towel-dried hair along with putting less strain on your hands, this is not it. I have relatively thin/dry hair and even after towel drying, this brush takes 5-7 mins longer to dry my hair vs a blow dryer and round brush. It is also rather bulky, which to me creates more strain on my hands. However, I have freakishly small child like hands, so I can't blame it hence why I felt it still merited 4 stars. What it does do great is leave my hair silky soft with little to no frizz. Its a breeze to flip the ends without needing my round brush + hair dryer. Last, I haven't achieved the volume a lot if influencers boast but I may need to keep at it with tutorials. Overall good tool, don't think I would cry if it died on me though.",4,One,B01LSUQSB0
"Alright, so I contemplated this blow dryer for a whole 24 hours before taking advantage of the Prime Day deal (that’s a long time for me- an impulse buyer) and I have a lot of thoughts. So if you’re looking for a detailed review then look no further.
*picture attached is right after using the product, before going out with a flat iron*
Background: I have semi-thick curly/wavy/FRIZZY hair
I am them type of person that will go another day with dirty hair just to avoid blow drying it. I was hoping that this would be a miracle device that would cut the time in half while also eliminating the need for a straightener. Well, it was definitely not that. BUT, it did straighten/smooth my hair significantly more than the average brush and blow dryer technique.
Pros: Lightweight, easy to use, fast-drying, and HOT
Cons: Semi-clunky, hard to reach roots of hair, doesn’t get hair as smooth as a flat iron, and HOT
While this product was easy to use, I can imagine how awkward it could feel to some, as it is larger than the average round brush. It’s definitely something that I will have to practice a little more with. But even with that awkwardness, it is far more convenient than having to hold a brush and a blow dryer at the same time. Unfortunately, here isn’t much temp control. Personally, this isn’t a problem for me because my hair will get about as straight as a curly fry without some serious heat. But for thinner hair, this could be problematic. There is a “Hot” and “Cool” but nothing in between.
Overall- I RECOMMEND. No, it’s not a miracle product but I only had to run the straightener over my hair (mostly roots and ends) for about 3 minutes after using it to get my hair as smooth as I like it. Plus, if you dread the normal blow drying routine as much I do, this is TOTALLY worth the money and the little faults.",4,0,B01LSUQSB0
"yes it dries the hair fast but the heat adjustment goes from low heat to max heat, nothing in between. I had to use the high heat to get my hair dry but eventually it burnt out my hair. I had to chop most of it off. Now I have short damaged hair. I don't recommend this brush",1,5,B01LSUQSB0
"OK, honestly I almost sent this back right out of the box--bear with me here. It's a LOT bigger than I was expecting--like a LOT bigger. It's actually lightweight for the size and after working with it for a bit I'm so glad I didn't return it. It leaves my hair sleek, with no frizz, and very shiny with minimal styling product. MUCH MUCH easier than juggling a dryer and brush and the results are so much better. Given the diameter of the brush I would say it would not be suitable for really short hair my hair is just short of touching my shoulder blades and it works great Also great for a quick fix for ""bed head"" a quick mist of water and a few swipes with the dryer brush and you're good to go.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"So I had read lots and lots of reviews on this and was kind of on the fence about purchasing it so I took the dive and just did it. Reviews say it’s heavy, but it’s definitely no heavier than holding your blow dryer up to do a blow out. I will say I’m a little disappointed in the fact that the temperature isn’t really controllable. You can do low and high and low is hot and powerful enough in my personal opinion. It gets pretty hot but so does a blow dryer. All in all I would say I’m not upset about the product. It’s made my getting ready process much faster so that is always a plus when you’re in a hurry or have a kid needing your attention like I do. I have a little longer than shoulder blade length hair that’s pretty thick and wavy and it took about 30 minutes to do my whole head. Definitely takes some practice if you aren’t used to doing blow outs",4,0,B01LSUQSB0
"This is a game changer for me. I have thick curly hair that I like to straighten, but I don't want it stick-straight. I just want to remove some of the small curls but keep the body and have some large waves. I bought this because of all of the positive reviews it received, and I wanted to add one more positive review to the list. It took me a couple of minutes to figure out how to hold this. Then I realized I could hold the far end (at the tip) with my other hand, much like I would a curling iron. I experimented with wrapping my hair around it and holding it in place so it could dry. I also tried kind of ""combing"" through my wet hair slowly. Both work great, but I think I like the first way best because it gave me the body and large waves I wanted. Also, I found that I could use this to go back over and smooth sections of hair that I had already dried. In other words, it was hot enough that it worked like a curling iron on dry hair. That was helpful because I was able to smooth the hair near my scalp so that it wasn't too curly, plus I could go over the stubborn sections of my hair that need some extra smoothing. This is very easy to use, and it has 3 settings on it. I used the hot setting. Also, using this saved me a lot of time. Compared to how I used to do my hair - blow dryer then curling or straightening iron - my hair was only being heated for half the time when I used this. I think this will keep my hair a bit healthier, simply because I'm not subjecting it to as much heat as I normally would because it only takes me half the time to do my hair now. I'm really pleased with this purchase and highly recommend it!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I really struggled with this product and since I had used something similar in the past I was expecting it to work just fine, but unfortunately was let down. The tool is HUGE and very difficult to maneuver around the head and through the hair. It is also very heavy (be prepared for an upper body workout) and the handle is awkward and makes it difficult to get a good grip. The airflow is very strong and very loud, so I do think it works well as a hair dryer, unfortunately it doesn't grip the hair with the bristles adequately so you end up with more frizz than the smoothed down and volumized look. I tried this product multiple times with varying degrees of ""hair dampness"" from just out of the shower to lightly damp and it never produced a good style. I do have long, thick, straight hair and have used curling dryers before with success, but this thing just missed the mark. I will also say that there are only two setting and no heat control. The high setting will fry anyone's hair - it's simply too hot. Don't risk you hair or your wallet.",2,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I thought this would be the answer.....but no. It made my hair soft and shiny, but it was flat and but it gave it no volume.....and this was after I got a tight perm. So if you want your curly hair to get stick-straight, this may be for you. I called Revlon to ask if they were going to make a similar item that is NOT oval (that's what straighten hair) but round. The said no. Yes, there are round blower brushes, but they all have the old fashion bristle and not the ion type of the Revlon One-Step. It is very clumsy to handle and may not be used in foreign countries.Are you listening, Revlon??????? I disappointedly returned it.",1,2,B01LSUQSB0
"Seriously where has this been all my life???? I have looooong (waist length) naturally wavy hair. I dread drying my hair since it takes....FOREVER!!! Attempting to use a round brush while drying my hair would turn into a tangled train wreck. Usually I only wear my hair straight when I get blow out done. Every flat iron I have ever tried just doesn’t do it (I’ve used some well rated and pricey ones)
I just used this dryer/brush for the first time. I’m in love. It had my long mop dried and straightened in less than 20 min!!! Now just need salons to have apts available to get it chopped and the roots touched up. Beaty salons are essential!!! If only this gizmo could do it all! ;)",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Never has a home blowout been so easy! I am terrible at round brushing my hair & trying to use both hands with different tools. This thing is great! Fries and styles so fast. Very convenient & better for my hair than drying and also using a flat iron after. This deletes the extra step. My hair comes out very smooth. It tames my thick, stubborn, curly bottom layer well. It is hot, so hot that my hands burns handling the hair pieces. I use my glove that came with a styling wand. Although its hot, i feel its still gotta be better for my hair than using multiple damaging tools, and literally my hair is done in less than 10 minutes. So it’s not on your hair long. I am just sure to use protectant. I section my hair in 3 layers horizontally. It’s very easy. Handle is large but made to hold very comfortably. Would be a little harder for someone who cannot holds their arms up for longer periods. My shoulders were a little sore the first week lol Happy customer!!!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"This has lots of air movement to dry quickly. Unfortunately, there isn't much choice for temperature control. It gets so hot, and there really needs to be a warm setting. I am concerned it is damaging my hair, and also this makes it difficult to use too close to ears without burning them. I now only use it on occasion to lesson the heat damage; I don't feel like it should be my daily hairdryer. If they redesign this, they need to give it more choices for temperature settings. An easier to hold tip would be helpful, which is a bit big, and the main handle is also too big around to easily use. It does do a nice job of drying and giving some volume with a slight curl at the hair ends. Just wish it wasn't so hot.",4,0,B01LSUQSB0
"OMG! First off the price is amazing. Way better priced than when I saw it at Ulta. And I got the pretty teal one which makes me happy every time I use it. Ok, let's talk about what this does. First off it works. I have fine hair that dries very kinky curly and frizzy. I let my hair air dry most of the way. I've already put in a leave in conditioner and a touch of hair oil. After it's partly air dried I separate it into four sections. I dry the bottom first, and let me say that the high is very hot, the lower heat setting works very well on my hair. Then I take down the next section and the next and finally the top. My hair is now nicely straight, like flat iron straight and full. The dryer really works. I don't believe I've spent years without this in my arsenal of stuff. I still air dry my hair and wear it curly but now I can really enjoy those blowout days and I've done it myself.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I have thick, frizzy, semi-curly hair. I can’t wear it natural and couldn’t be bothered blow-drying normally because it takes so long to get through my thick hair. Normally I shower at night, air dry overnight and straighten in the morning.

I just bought this tool and I love it. As other reviews said- it is a bit heavy, and it’s loud like a blow dryer (slightly quieter than a normal one). However, I would still choose to buy this again and again.

From wet, I was able to dry my hair in about 20 minutes and it came out straight. It’s not as flat as it would be with a straightener but still straight and slightly puffy. It comes out nice and I got a lot of compliments at work. SO much easier than it was before.

For occasions or when I want it perfect I’ll definitely still use my straightener. But for everyday use as a busy working mom to a 1 year old this is a huge time saver.

Cons:
-kind of heavy
-loud
- bottom part under brush gets very hot and it’s unfortunately where my finger naturally would rest while using the brush, so I need to be careful about it.

Overall an awesome purchase!! Highly recommend!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
Ok so I'm not a girly girl at all. I really like this. It looked huge in the pictures but once I got it it really wasn't too big. It definitely does a good job at straightening but definitely not salon quality but definitely for a fast or in a pinch timeframe I really do like this. It didn't leave my hair frizzy but my regular straightener does a better job but than again maybe I just don't know how to use it perfectly. I would definitely say this is a great product for a great price.,5,One,B01LSUQSB0
I saw this product on tik tok and just had to get it for myself! Dries hair quicker than a regular blow dryer and gives hair more volume. It’s easy to use and dries the hair nicely- the only thing I would say is I think it might be a tad damaging to hair. My hair feels frizzy after using it and I still have to straighten it... and I anyways use heat protectant. But my hair is frizzy after blow drying it with a regular blow dryer too so I don’t know if it’s just like all heat products...,5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I have very thick, mid-back-length, somewhat wavy hair that's smooth on top, a little coarse underneath, and weighs down my roots. Unfortunately I also have exactly zero practice doing the whole round brush blowout thing, minus a harrowing experience in the ninth grade. I really wanted to learn, though, and I figured I could simplify the process for my clumsy self if I didn't have to concentrate on holding both the dryer and the brush (I'm wiser than I was at fourteen but my concentration probably isn't much better).

I tried it out on freshly washed and conditioned hair after manually shaking out a good bit of water and putting a dollop of inexpensive mousse at my roots. My results weren't blowout level but my strands were silkier and my roots noticeably plumped up. For a first attempt, I'm pretty pleased.

I will say that despite blowing pretty hot, it took a lot longer to actually get my hair dry than it does with my regular blowdryer, starting at the same dampness level. I think next time I'll do my usual upside down blow-drying for a minute or two before I set in with the volumizer, just to start with a slightly dryer base.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I finally decided to get this after many good reviews and suggestions on social media; I was able to get it for a good sale price that made it worth it. Overall, I am pretty happy and think it lives up to most of the hype. I have VERY thick and wavy hair that takes a LOT of work to make straight. With this, I was able to brush out several layers of my (towel-dried) hair with a heat protectant and dry it fairly quickly. It's not quite salon blowout quality, but it's definitely sufficient to quickly straighten/dry my hair to get out the kinks and waves. Definitely in good shape to further smooth/straighten with a flat iron. I am glad I got this because the quality is the same or slightly better than using a hair dryer with a round brush. It is a bit heavy, but wasn't too bad. And it's much more convenient to use this than the hair dryer and brush. I think that it helps that you can brush both from under and over a section of hair to help with straightening and smoothing. I think you will have varied results depending on your type of hair--and I definitely think you need a heat protectant because it gets HOT on the high setting. People with thinner or straighter hair will probably LOVE this, but those of us with thick and textured hair will still find it useful.",4,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I’m typically lazy with my hair since it’s thick and dries puffy / wavy. I got this for Christmas and can’t stop using it! I sectioned my hair into 4 parts and it takes me ~5 minutes per section to dry and style. It dries completely and styles all in one step. NO NEED FOR A STRAIGHTENER OR CURLER! I’m not a “hair person” by any means, and this product is so easy to use. Get yourself one if you’re looking for a new go-to styling tool.",5,3,B01LSUQSB0
"“I’ve never had a bad experience with a round brush!” said no one ever, but this makes is incredibly easy, even if you don’t have the experience with one! The bristles are incredibly soft, which allows your hair to go through smoother and the brush has a large enough circumference that my hair doesn’t get tangled (it’s shoulder-length, fine and naturally wavy). The amount of volume I get is amazing! I can leave without having the need to straighten it to get rid of the frizz or I can curl it and it has amazing bounce.

The only negative is that “high” is essentially the hot setting, which I hate. I wish it had a high “warm” setting simply because I feel like I’m frying my hair.",4,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I meah... meh. I have zero experience with blow drying my hair. When I style it, it's usually the day after I wash it and let it air-dry. So after my first time using this, I am a little underwhelmed. It's probably because I have no idea what I'm doing and my hair is very long, thick and coarse. Did it dry my hair in a shorter amount of time? Sure. Is my hair straighter with fewer bumps then if I had used a straightener? Yeah. Does it have more volume? Not really, but I haven't really figured that part out yet. I'm disappointed with the fact that I can't get my ends to curl or wave or do anything other than lay straight. The first picture is just using the blow dryer and the second picture is when I went over it with my curler on the ends to give it a little more oomph. I just noticed the ends of my hair are not pictured😅 I plan on using it a few more times, playing around with different techniques and updating my review! It's a blow-dryer! And a brush! I'm giving it 4 stars because it does what it's supposed to do, I guess, I just need to learn the tips and tricks 😂",4,0,B01LSUQSB0
"My sister had mentioned she bought the Dyson brush dryer and I know she spent a fortune on it with all the attachments and whatnot. I really wanted to try one out for myself, but was not going to spend $200-$300! So when I came across this one and after reading an article about these brushes and this one being on the list of top 10 I went ahead and bought it! The first time using it I learned the feel for how it worked and understood what I needed to do to achieve a certain look. By the second time I really loved the outcome and especially how smooth my hair felt and how straight it was! In the first time in 30 years I had completely straight hair without having to use a straightener or my sad attempt at permanently straightening my hair when I was 13(It did not go as planned even though my aunt was a hairstylist). For the price this was I am absolutely thrilled with the outcome and also do not feel that I am damaging my hair as badly as I would if I used a straightener. Also what I think ultimately helps keep my hair so soft and smooth is using a heat protection cream or gel before using any heating equipment!! Love love love it!! Thanks for such a great product!! And a great price!!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"This brush is so awesome for making the perfect blow out. However, you need to be careful on how hot you let the brush get. You definitely NEED to switch between the settings of cool, high, and low. Using it on high the whole time makes the brush too hot. It is not a blow dryer but a styling tool, and that is an important distinction. I reccomend lightly drying hair with a regular blow dryer before styling. When a flat iron gets too hot, we would lower the temp and wait for it to drop off a bit, it's the same with this. I recommend using high heat for initial styling then using cool to ""set"" and cool down the hair sealing in the style for each section. This way the hair and the brush don't get too hot. Its also important to periodically clean the bristles of any loose hairs to prevent that burnt hair smell and keep the tool in good shape. If i could change one thing it would be the ability to regulate temperature, but it is still a great tool",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I always love how my hair looks right after it's cut and blow dried but I've never had the patience or frankly the hand coordination to do it at home. The first time I used this I wasn't impressed because I, being the lazy & clumsy person I am, did it completely wrong. My sister corrected my errors with a tutorial and I am super impressed!

It is time consuming (about 20 minutes because I have thick curly hair) compared to how I used to blow dry... but I don't have to straighten my hair after except for minor touch ups sometimes. So in the long run, I'm saving time. I also found that my hair is better the next day with less bed head.

After a few uses and dropping it a couple times, I got the hang of it & as I've mentioned, I am super clumsy when it comes to hair so I think most people can get used to it. Best ~$40 I've spent on a hair tool.

I put 4 stars on the temp control because the ""high"" setting does get ear-burning hot but the ""low"" wasn't enough. Whatever you do, don't touch the brush when using 0_0",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Was definitely skeptical of this working for my hair type, and I did not do a great job the first time that I used it because I’m pretty bad with styling tools. Watched some Youtube tutorials and realized that the secret is to section your hair into very small sections. So I used it again, putting my hair into very small sections with each getting a nice coat of silicone-based heat protectant serum over a thin layer of avocado oil, and let my hair get about 1/2 dry before using the low heat setting. This worked incredibly well! The actual blow drying part took about 15 minutes to do my whole head. I was impressed with the results.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Alright, take a seat, let me tell you how good this thing is. Once upon a time, I would struggle to do my hair, like many of us girls, I’ve dyed my hair, not a lot, but, it has definitely damaged my hair a bit. I used to dye it black only but decided to change it up and do the famous “ balayage” and she had to remove the black dye so, I was in the salon for 5 hours. Mind you, I’m a very simple girl, I don’t really do my hair everyday or my makeup and when I do, I do the easiest most comfortable hairstyle possible. I would usually just curl my hair since it would hide the dry, burned parts of my hair. I was looking for something that would make my hair smooth without having to iron it and at the same time, give it volume since I have thin hair. After reading some reviews and looking at some pictures, I bought it. I got it 2 days later and as soon as I did, I washed my hair and spent some time trying it out. I applied some heat protectant and some oil in the lower part of my hair and maybe spent some 30 minutes going at it. Wow wow wow, I couldn’t believe my hair could like that, I really thought I was in a Pantene commercial, I instantly called my boyfriend and showed it off. I texted some friends that struggle with their hair too and I had to tell them about the amazing tool I had just discovered. I felt like Christopher Columbus. My friend came over the next day and I did her hair, and she bought it right there and then. The end.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I feel bad that some people have not had a great experience with this product. However, those reviews are from a few years back. The brush is heavy but I use 2 hands when drying my hair. I could never use a round brush and blow dryer. This works great. I use it on high and low, never had a prob with weird noises or temperature. There is even a cool setting. I do have shoulder-length this hair so this works great for me. My friend also has this- she has thick curly hair, which is long and she is happy with the product. Also, my daughter has thick long hair and it did take some time, but her hair turned out great and shiny!
Bottom line- can't do your hair like a pro? Buy this. You will build arm muscle and look good.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I was hesitant to purchase this after seeing mixed reviews all over the internet, but my cousin convinced me after seeing how good her hair looked last week! This thing appears clunky, but the handle is actually easier to use than I thought it would be. I've got pretty long hair ATM and it did not tangle or catch it. I sectioned my hair in three pieces and used the dryer to get a nice shiny result with some volume as well. That has been lacking for me as of late with this growth. I've felt my hair just appears flat so this was a pleasant surprise. My advice is to air dry your hair to almost 75-80% dry and then go in and finish it with this styler. It's not worth it to spend the time drying overly wet hair with this. I did that the first time and had to stop, use the blow dryer to expedite the process, and then go back and finish with this styler. I was smarter the second time around and it made all the difference.",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"The biggest flaw with this is the size. You'd think big=more drying surface, etc, but it was hard for me personally to get up to my roots, and it was hard to not let the brush grab other sections of hair while working on another, causing a huge knot. I also got this as kind of an experiment for my mom, who is in a wheelchair and has rough hair. It is hard for her to blow dry herself, and with quarantine, she can't get it done and no one can go help her. I think this could work, I will let her try it, but I think it is too bulky for her to be able to manage. My hair is boon-length, hers is shoulder length, and she wears it like a helmet bob (sorry mom lol). She also has bangs, so idk about all that with such a big brush.

I will say though, it worked very well. Much easier than a blow dryer for me. I have thick thin hair, as in I have a high density of thin strands. I tangle SO easily, and my scalp is VERY sensitive to knots and pulling.

The swivel cord worked great, the unit is lightweight, and it dried my hair. I was done in 15 minutes with minimal sectioning. Now, I didn't style it, simply dried it with a straight motion and tucked under a bit so it didn't curl out like the 60s.

The ""cool touch tip"" actually got pretty warm as I moved through my hair, so I may get gloves for this I am also sensitive to heat though. ALSO, I wear a necklace and never take it off, and when doing the undersides of my hair, the omnidirectional blower heated up my necklace to a point that I noticed, and it could probably even burn me if I let it, so keep that in mind.

Overall, so far so good. It dries hair, it's light, it's cheapish, etc. Does what it's supposed to do, basically. I will update if anything changes!",4,0,B01LSUQSB0
"First time trying one of these types of tools!
I’ve never tried to do a blow out before and I never dry my hair because it will frizz out and takes to long. If I want to style my hair with hot tools I usually just don’t wash it. This is going to change that when I’m feeling Grungy and want to wash my hair!

As you can see in one picture, I have very curly hair! Hence why I never blow dry.

The second picture is my first attempt at using this tool. I just used this dryer and some hair product, no other styling tools. I sectioned off the top and bottom half of my hair while using it.

It was super easy, even for someone who’s never used a tool like this! I will have to work at getting the top part of my head a little more, there’s a curl/crease I didn’t quite get out, but for a first time attempt I’m really impressed and happy!

I might towel dry my hair a little longer next time to speed up the process, but this still dried and shined my hair better than a blow dryer ever has! I’m really excited. I can’t wait to work with it more!",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"Definitely not what I expected. I have very long & thick hair (although straight). But my hair holds and absorbs water like no other. It normally takes me 20-30 minutes just to blow dry it and sometimes my roots would still feel damp. This cut the drying time in half. Since my hair is pretty straight and really only takes 5 minutes or so to straighten (just to take down some frizz and puffiness from the blow dryer), I really only bought this to try to cut down on my drying time and it is DEFINITELY worth it for that. Takes me maybe 10-15 minutes now.

I was also worried about this getting caught and tangling my hair since my hair is so long, but no issues there either. Slides very nicely through your hair. I can only imagine how well it would work on someone who has thick and curly hair because it would definitely be a time saver for someone like that if it works this well on my thick straight hair.",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I have only had this brush/dryer for a day but I couldn't wait to try it out. I have very fine, thin hair which means it's also very flat and lifeless. I have avoided hairstyles that require any amount of effort simply because I didn't believe I could ever achieve any volume without spending tons on hair product and time. This dryer is super easy to use. There's some trial and error at first but I quickly figured out how to hold it properly, particularly in the back. I didn't use any product but still got a nice lift at the roots that I've never been able to accomplish before. I'll try it with root lifter next time. It took 8 minutes to dry my hair so it didn't really add a lot to my morning routine either. I'll try to remember to take pics also.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I have to say I was skeptical about this thing. I’m a traditional “hair dryer and round brush” person who then has to go over her hair with a flat iron to achieve results. But damn, this thing is magic. I’m kind of annoyed that I didn’t know about it sooner. I can get the style I want just from this dryer and I love it so much.
From some of the more negative reviews, I can just assume that they don’t understand how to use the device properly. I get plenty of volume and bend/curl at my ends. Everyone’s hair is different, so not all products are going to work for everyone - but you certainly should give this a try. I’ve told everyone I know about it since I’ve bought it, and everyone who has followed has felt the same as I do. The only negative thing I have to say is that there isn’t any temp control - but honestly, to me, that is not a deal breaker. Use a heat protectant and move the styler- don’t just hold it on a strand and let it fry your hair (as you would with any other dryer/iron). I love this styler. LOVE it.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"To some people boar bristles may not be a problem hence making it a nice blowout tool.
HOWEVER, for Vegans, Muslims and Jews who do not consume pork and is forbidden might want to find alternatives. This tool has boar technology making it forbidden for use since it releases boar enzymes in your hair during use.",2,2,B01LSUQSB0
"I suck at doing hair. I am clumsy. I also have super thick curly/wavy/frizzy hair which is a constant battle for me, has been all my life. This one tool changed my life!! I actually go to gym more because I can wash my hair daily if I need to because I can literally dry, straighten/smooth, and style my hair in FIFTEEN MINUTES!! Its amazing!!! The best part is that my hair looks styled, not just straightened. When I just to straighten my hair with a flat iron, you could tell. With this tool, I just look like I have really great, volumized, fabulous hair which falls effortlessly into place. This little gem from Revlon is a must for every crazy-haired girl!!",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I had been perfectly happy and content using a hair dryer and round boar brush on my hair for styling prior to this purchase. I needed to replace my old and dying hair dryer, and my search for a new one lead to my stumbling upon this product. After tons of research and watching demos on YouTube, I decided to buy it and give it a try. I’m actually amazed.. I didn’t think it would do any better if a job than my old ways at making my hair soft and shiny, but I was wrong. It’s not only easier to use than a dryer and round brush, it gives my hair a supple, conditioned, shiny result all the way down to the very ends of my hair.. I took pics, and can’t stop touching my hair. Wow. Revlon, you are a genius.

I usually have course, wavy hair with tons of fly-always and dry ends.. not now. Finally I can get the same results as a professional blowout at home. I’m impressed and stoked. This changes the game for me.

If you are on the fence, just do it. This product will not disappoint. Just wow!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"A couple of potential minor cons for some, but great product for me. I have fine (processed) shoulder length hair that is a little wavy with frizzy ends unless I smooth them out. I purchased this because I recently hurt my lower back and standing to dry, then use a flat iron was aggravating existing sciatica pain to the point I had to take frequent breaks. This product is an awesome time saver and for me, completely eliminated the use of the flat iron for smoothing my hair. I think I was completely done in less than 10 minutes after some air drying and anticipate only another 5 minutes if I had just towel dried. If you have thick hair, the high setting will work well but it's pretty hot so I turned it down to low and was surprised at how fast it still dried my hair. It also has a cool setting that I used for the front top and fringe area because I tend to get breakage easily there from pulling while drying with a round brush if I am not careful. The bristles on this do a great job of letting you easily grab the hair and the size prevents tangling, plus it has some longer bristles with covered tips so it doesn't hurt your head like a previous product I owned. I have bangs and was still able to grab them with the curved side and give them a lift. This product dries quickly, adds volume, and my hair is shiny and soft. I am rating it a five but there are a couple things that may bother some people...

First - It is somewhat heavy and the part you hold is large, but since it worked so fast the weight was tolerable for me. Having such a large handle didn't bother me because I don't have to do much turning with my length of hair. I don't know if it would be annoying for really long hair.

Second - It is very very loud, maybe it's more noticeable because you're putting it a lot closer to the head than the a normal hair dryer but it is much louder then my regular dryer. I have a 4 year old girl with sensory issues and it's going to take some exposure work before I can use it on her hair. She heard me using it from another room and came in to the bathroom plugging her ears. Drying her hair currently takes a long time on a low setting with a regular dryer and diffuser, so I am really hoping to transition her to using this since it will significantly reduce drying time. I realize this is a very specific scenario but may be important to others if you are planning to use it for someone with similar sensitivity or is on the Autism spectrum.

Overall I am so happy with the performance and results of the product, I have not been able to do much with my hair for two months and it feels so nice to look like I care again, lol!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Let me start by saying when this dryer works it is my absolute favorite. However, I bought the first one in January 2020 and immediately fell in love. After 4 months in burnt out. Like set my smoke alarms off, burning hair smell, completely fried. I figured I have very long, thick hair and I didn’t clean it out often enough. Considering the price point I figured this delicate tool needed a gentler touch. So I ordered another one in June 2020. This time I was careful I cleaned out the brush after every use, didn’t pull hard. I’ve probably used this a grand total of 10 times in the laAt 2 months and today it fried again. Burn hair smell, set off my smoke alarm, completely dead. Just beware that you get what you pay for and at this price point the quality it terrible. I’ll be looking into similar options with better quality.",1,2,B01LSUQSB0
"This styler is incredible and one of the best tools I have purchased in a while. I have been curling my hair with curling irons and wands for over 10 years and was looking for something that will be less damaging and create a more natural ""blow out"" look. This tool is the perfect solution!! It took a few times to get it down but MAN this thing creates beautiful shiny and soft hair that looks like you just left the Dry Bar for a professional blow out! I use the low setting for my fine, medium-length hair and that works perfect. Another huge plus for me is I save 20 minutes every morning by being able to skip the blow dryer and not having to section and curl my hair, this baby does it all. I hate to admit once you start using this bad boy you will be flipping your gorgeous hair like a supermodel and you will not stop. :)",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"Great dryer. Cuts down on drying time. A little bulky but I suppose that’s unavoidable. Overall I like it a lot. I’m still trying to master the technique, but so far it’s been a positive experience. Good heat and air flow.

Edited: This thing is incredible. I actually timed my drying time with a stopwatch today. From wet hair to styled in 3:40. Yes. Three minutes and forty seconds. Stepped out of shower and wrapped my hair in a towel. Only for a minute or three. Took hair out of towel, did the moisturizer/sunscreen thing on my face, threw on lipstick because I got a new shade and wanted to try it. So my slightly shorter than shoulder length hair is still WET. I brushed out the tangles, added some Bouncy Cream (love that too) to my superfine very straight and flyaway hair which I usually fight with for like ten minutes or more with a regular dryer and a big round brush. I went from soggy to styled in less than four minutes. When I figure out how, I will post a pic.",4,0,B01LSUQSB0
"It's probably not the best blow dry brush on the market, but it's ok. It's VERY loud considering it isn't as powerful as my other blow dryer. But it is much easier than using a blow dryer and a brush at the same time. Usually I'll rough dry my hair 80% with my regular blow dryer and then blast it with cool air and then finish it with this guy, which works well and gives nice shape and volume. Otherwise I'd be spending 30 minutes drying with this one on high heat which just isn't good for hair (and I don't have that kind of time in the morning). Overall I'm a little underwhelmed considering the hype but it's pretty good, and if you've never used a blow dry brush before you'll probably like it a lot!",4,0,B01LSUQSB0
"We buy the product through Amazon and make sure that the seller is Revlon, to avoid buying products not certified by the brand, but not Work after second use.

The product got TOO HOT after 3 minutes of use and turned off, a lot of smoke started coming out of the brush.
This is the second time my wife has used since we bought it.
The next day we reconnected it again and did not turn on, and after 15 seconds a lot of smoke began to come out of it and it got so hot that we couldn't hold it in hand.

The product does not work and we are afraid it will start a fire. Please tell us what can we do?",1,2,B01LSUQSB0
"This hair dryer is a game changer. I can finally get a smooth blow dry - even on rainy days. I thought I was pretty good at a blow out but I still couldn't get anywhere close to salon results. Even when I did it could all frizz up at the first sign of sweat or humidity. Now I can achieve smooth hair all of the time. Don't get me wrong, I don't have curly, tangled thick hair. Just straight fine hair that just wants to look frizzy.

My only complaint is that it is very hot and I do worry I'll end up with damage. I wish there was separate speed and heat settings because I would want the high speed at a lower heat. Still, I'm taking my chances and enjoying my smooth hair.",4,0,B01LSUQSB0
I bought the Revlon One-Step Hair Dryer And Volumizer Hot Air Brush after seeing several advertisements and doing a little research. I'm not one for extra things/gadgets but am so happy I tried this one. My hair is long and fine and tangles easy. This has simplified my hair routine and keeps me from getting tangled like I did with the usual round brush routine. I get a little lift nothing crazy but am happy with it. If you're considering this dryer do it. I would only mention that the temperature control is a a rotating slider on the bottom of the dryer which takes a little getting used to. Enjoy!,5,2,B01LSUQSB0
"My hair is the one thing I really take pride in, I can't always wear a lot of makeup because I am always working etc and so If my hair looks good I FEEL GOOD. This hair dryer might seem like a dream come true, because it was fast and efficient at drying hair and is amazing HENCE ALL THE GOOD REVIEWS from people that tried and liked it on the 1st couple times of using it, BUT if a dryer gets your hair so hot that you have to use a GLOVE to hold your hair because your hand if burning then think of the damage. I thought it would be okay, since curling irons sometimes come with a glove but that is just to protect your hand from the curler. Even though I was ignorant to this right away, I realized this now and hopefully can save someone elses hair. I bought this dryer in May 2020 and my hair from ears down (mid-length) hair is fryed/damaged. I contacted Revlon and I want my money back. I have to wait for them to do testing on the dryer after I send it in. Which is fine, but I feel its not great customer service to ask this considering there are plenty of reviews stating the same thing I am saying and now its like they want to play dumb that maybe its just a defect. NO the high setting is too HOT. IF you blow dry your hair with this and it is too hot to touch SEND THIS DRYER BACK ASAP before you loose your money. I would appreciate if AMAZON would please refund me so I dont have to wait weeks for REVLON to finish LAB REPORT ON THIS DRYER.",1,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I really really loved this dryer. The first one lasted me 2 months (exactly) before it fizzled and died.

Bought a second one, it died in the first 60 seconds I used it.

For some reason I decided to buy this dryer for a THIRD TIME. this one lasted me 4 months...but alas it's dead again.

Never again, I say...NEVER!!!",1,3,B01LSUQSB0
"I’ve purchased a total of five of these. One for me and four for our grown daughters. I do love it other than it looks like it will only last about two years. The bristles started falling out not long ago and one side of the brush where it gets used most has completely flattened, making it impossible to run it through my hair. Maybe there’s nothing they can do to prevent that but if they could, that would be great. I have thick, curly hair that’s past my shoulders and I do love drying it with this. No need for a straightener which is a huge plus. I’ve added a picture of my hair if I just let it dry on its own and after using this dryer. Can’t beat it for the beautiful outcome. Just wish it lasted longer.",4,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Yep. Just throw them away because you’re never going to use them again. This is amazing. This dryer brush combo is so easy to use. I sectioned of my hair and got what looks like a professional salon blow out. I have long thick blonde hair that is part curly and part straight when left to dry on its own. I used to blow dry. Then flat iron. Now I just do it all in one step. I like to think I’m saving my hair a little since I’m not flat ironing it anymore.

"Awesome product, ive been using mine since 2019 and it has worked perfectly. My mom once made it pop somehow (she said it exploded) but after clicking the buttons on the charger (plug) i was able to use it again.
To not burn my hair i let it air dry first and then use this drier with heat protection products in my hair.
I usually dry my hair, which is very thick, in the lowest setting and at the end i use the fast and hot setting to set everything up.
I make sure i clean the brush every time i use it(remove the hairs on it). My mom and i use it without issues so far. Worked perfectly while in lockdown",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I hardly ever write reviews, but this tool is a MIRACLE!!!! Everyone with curly or wavy hair who wants to cut their straightening/styling time in half (or more) NEEDS THIS!!!! I have never been able to blow dry my hair straight (or even close to straight.) I am 38. My mom and sister are both stylists, but I do not have their education, experience, or abilities. I just can’t dry my hair straight. Every 3rd day, I usually wait 3 hours for my hair to dry, and then spend 45 minutes ironing my hair straight at 410 degrees. You know how damaging that can be. I also am klutzy, so I regularly burn myself with my straight iron. I received this today, had wet hair, used it for three minutes, and half of my hair is already straight!!! I didn’t do the other side yet, because I had to tell everyone about my success. I have been texting and sending pics to all my friends and family who regularly straighten their hair. This is not like the cheap, plastic brush straighteners that were a huge fad a few years ago (my hair is way too curly, and those didn’t ever work for me.) This tool was recommended to me by my stylist at my last hair cut. Her store had sold out of them, so I ordered mine here. I saved $10, and have immediate, positive responses. This works with thick, frizzy, super kinky and curly hair. Finally!!!!! Something that is simple and actually works!!!! So very excited and happy with my results so far!",5,2,B01LSUQSB0
"This will replace your traditional blow dryer and brush as it smooths our hair straight while drying it. It’s realy a phenomenal product and the concept of it is even better. It is a life changing product bc it elimtaes the hassle of traditional blow drying. However, I must state that some adjustments can be made to it. The product is very heavy , loud and bulky. Your wrists get tired after using it. Also, it doesn’t realy get my baby hairs well as it is so big and round that it does not work for my tiny hairs. I think in the market we will see a more refined and sleeker version to come from Revlon and other hair companies alike.

After using this product for a month I have rea time feedback. This styler has damaged my hair and has broken the entire front of my hairline. What I thought was an incredible product is a HOAX. My hair is completely damaged and broken from it after using it for a month. BIG MISTAKE. I’ve never had broken hair in the front of my scalp like this and it will take time to recover. DO NOT get fooled by this product.",1,3,B01LSUQSB0
I bought this back in June 2019. Never really used so often but the few times I did I was happy with results absolutely does cut hair styling time in half or possibly more. To give an idea Of how often I used this product I would say once a month. (Minus the 7months being honest due to corona) safe to safe it hasn’t been used a great deal. Unfortunately notice from the beginning That the bristles have basically melted progressively. And the temperature dials are all the same. It’s constantly very hot on a low speed and sometimes I get the cool option to work. It’s only been 1.5yrs of having with minimal use and it’s crapped out on me :( also would be great if you improved the sound when it’s on mine always sounded the same as when an old blow dryer is about to burn out,3,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I was hesitant to try this dryer/volumizer because I have hair extensions and my hair stylist recommended against buying it. I've been pleasantly surprised--yes, I need to be a bit more careful because of the extensions, however, it does a fabulous job styling my hair in no time flat. Make sure your hair isn't soaking wet before using--you should have you hair a bit damp before using. I dry with this in sections and it gives you lift and shine. One thing I do not like about it are the heat controls. They are awkward to switch on and off or regulate the heat while drying your hair. The controls are located around the bottom of the unit and makes it near impossible to operate. Also, there's not much difference between hot and medium controls. You could easily burn yourself--it gets that hot. Overall very satisfied--would have given 5 stars but the heat control location is a real drawback.",4,0,B01LSUQSB0
Im giving a four just because I haven’t had it long and it could crap out. But so far I really like it. It’s easier than using a round brush plus dryer because I can use only one hand. It dries my hair quick and I’ve been watching carefully and also moving up heat settings slowly and it does not appear to be damaging it. I have been using Cantu heat protectant spray with it though. I will update if it dies on me like some of the reviews have said. The box says “new and improved” so I’m hoping not.,4,2,B01LSUQSB0
I was a bit skeptical since I’m pretty basic with my hair and can barely use a blow dryer and straightener but I must say this was pretty easy to use. It leaves your hair as if you just got a blowout at the salon. Having thin hair there’s not much that gives me volume but this tool most definitely did! I highly recommend it.,5,2,B01LSUQSB0
"I was a little skeptical at first because I have long thick hair and it tangles easily especially when wet BUT I just let my hair air dry for about an hour and just used it for the first time and wow! No tangles, much less frizz, soft, quicker than a blow drier and easy to use. I read reviews that this tool was loud, large and hot. It does kind of sound like a vacuum lol but my ears weren’t ringing by the time I finished if that says anything. It is pretty large but what do you expect with a brush and drier in one? It does get hot but not any worse than some of the hair driers I’ve owned. I also use a blow dry spray that provides intense heat protection. Overall happy with my purchase!! Buy one!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"My hair has been so silky and soft after using this one step blow dryer! I seriously can’t live without it. I have really long hair and this product makes my hair more flowy and bouncy. This product makes my hair shine, removes the frizz and straightens my hair without making it toooo flat like a straighter does. My hair looks very healthy and strong after using this as well. there’s so many good things about this product and I could go on and on. I just can’t believe how much this product has changed my hair and transformed my look. I have also gotten a lot of compliments from people about my hair as well.

I was afraid this product was going to tangle my hair and my hair will get stuck on the brush but nothing of that sort even happened which I am so happy about. It gives the perfect blow out look and you don’t have to waste your hard earned money at a salon. The one con I could think of is that it takes a while for my hair to dry in the low setting. Probably like 12 minutes which I don’t really mind. The high setting gets really hot which I don’t really use as much.

Anyways, Please buy this product, you won’t regret it!!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I was absolutely in love with my one-step hair dryer until it died. As I was using the dryer it suddenly cut-off and smelled like it was on fire. It completely seized up and burnt-up.

Now I have to shell out more money to purchase another dryer. I'm so disappointed in this product.",3,One,B01LSUQSB0
"After reading all the positive reviews I was so excited to try this product. I have very thick and sometimes wiry hair. I've always blow-dried, then straightened my hair with a flat iron so I thought using this would help me save some time. It did not! Firstly, the setting on high was way too hot! I could smell my hair burning. On the lower setting, it was not hot enough so I ended up spending more time blow drying my hair. Another issue I had is that I couldn't reach my roots to straighten them so they were still curly/wavy! I then had to use my straightener to fix the areas the dryer didn't get. Not worth it!",1,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I loved what it did for my hair. Thick layers of hair, but fine b/c I'm a blonde. It went through my hair, even to my scalp, perfectly. It smoothed out the frizzies and put a soft curl in it too. (I let it dry partially before using.) The size was surprising, but it shouldn't have been. I read these were big and if you think of a normal hairdryer, the end part that blows hot air, then you add the bristles over that, then the size shouldn't be surprising. Of course it is big. I said ""duh"" to myself. 🙃 The handle is large too, making it a bit tricky, but as advertised, the end stays cool so you can use both ends to manage its use.",4,0,B01LSUQSB0
"My first use I followed the directions and dried my hair the way it recommends. I have long hair down to my lower back so it was quite a chore to dry my hair the way it recommended (part into sections and and do each section separately). I did not notice any volume or body to my hair, it actually laid somewhat flat. I usually blow dry my hair upside down to give it volume. So I used the dryer brush with my hair flipped over like I blow dry it. Way more volume. I used it on high heat until my hair wasn't as wet(I have fine hair, it didn't damage it). Then changed to low heat to finish up. Did the trick. I'm not sure if it was faster to dry my hair with this or a blow dryer considering how long my hair is.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I was really excited to try this 2 in 1 styler and ordered one for myself. My hair felt really soft and looked really great after using this styler, I thought finally I have something to rely on which prevents me from going to the salon every week. But sadly after 5-10 mins of blow dry, my hair went back to its natural state and next day looked as though I haven’t styled at all... very disappointed 😒",1,8,B01LSUQSB0
"I recently went to the salon for the first time in ages. My stylist told me to stop flat ironing my hair and try a drying brush instead, my hair is very dry and frizzy. I’ve been using a flat iron every single morning for many years. I was skeptical, things like this usually don’t work well for me. I ordered this one about a month ago and...wow. I put my flat iron away and haven’t had to use it since! I wanted to wait a while before reviewing in case it stopped working like other reviews said. It still works just fine! It smooths my hair, while giving a curl to the ends. It’s exactly like I went to the salon for a blowout. And drying my hair is faster. For my dry hair, I use a protectant before using this, and a light hair oil after. My hair feels and looks so much healthier and I’ll recommend this brush to anyone.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Overall, I love this hair dryer! It's great for someone like me who isn't good with doing hair, as I don't have to fumble with a heavy hair dryer and a brush at the same time. So it makes it much easier to do and get a good result. My only problem with this dryer is OMG does it get HOT! I have burned my fingers from touching my hair right after running the dryer through it. It makes my hair untouchable for several moments after running it through. I have a lot of fine hair, so that much heat is WAY too intense and damaged my hair very quickly, even though I use a heat protectant. Yet the cold setting is too cold. They need an inbetween setting like most hair dryers have. That would make this great. Perhaps an easier way to switch between hot and cold might make it easier, since it's not something you can easily flip between? Love the hair dryer but they need a medium heat option.",4,0,B01LSUQSB0
I have long thick hair and I was fearful to try this due to the bristles (the bristle type has always created frizz) but WHOA! THIS dryer brush is 👏👏 amazing! Again I was very skeptical and an old school brand like Revlon...well my prejudgemnts were wrong. With a dryer and seperate brush my hair would take an hour but this...10 to 12 minutes with barely towel dried hair. Creates smooth hair salon dried hair. And I only wash my hair every other day and on my non wash days I simple use some dry shampoo and use the low setting for 3min to get the bedhead out back to smooth. Best money spent on a hair tool in a very long time...and I am extremely picky as I am not a gal who is good at hair styling...more of a top head large bun wearer (simple) but I wear my hair down often now because of this dryer brush. Life changing product for me 🤗🎉,5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I have really long really really thick hair. I am pretty lazy when it comes to hair care. I have SO much hair and it takes forever to dry. If I just leave it, it will take hours. If I blow dry it, my arms ache. So usually I just leave it.
I went through a break up and I made the stereotypical mistake of getting bangs. Even my hairdresser had a hard time lying about it looking good. Anyway, I found that the only way to make them look good was to blow dry my hair. Every.Day. Ugh. Lazy girls nightmare.
I’m not super coordinated and drying while brushing at the same time is not me forte.
Enter this brush hair dryer combo. My life is saved. It still takes me quite some time to dry my hair, but no where near as long as regular hair drying. It also looks like I got a blow out which, never happens to me. Like I look way more put together and styled.
Can not recommend enough.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I have straight hair that’s on the thin side, but a lot of it. I am not great at “styling my hair”.....I have 2 expensive Chi straighteners and a nice blow dryer, but I always end up with frizzy flat hair.

I bought this after my sister and sister-in-law both convinced me. I am so thrilled with it. To be honest, my hair does not look like the beautiful blow-out style of curls and volume of the other reviews, but my hair looks SO much better after I use this. I put a little heat protector/leave in conditioner on my hair after the shower while it’s wet, then turn my head upside down and blow dry for 3-4 minutes. I section it off and use this on low, and it not only drys much faster, but it has so much volume and is not frizzy.

Then within 4 months the thing smelled horrible, checked the filter, nope. Tried it one more time and I realized the motor was where the burning smell was coming from.

After 2 weeks of using only twice a week it is impossible to use. Won't stay on. I am sure it could be fixed but I am over 60 and I have no idea where you would start! It should not have come apart and shpuld have lasted a lot longer than a couple of weeks. Should have sent back but kept forgetting to do so. Getting old can suck dometimes!

NOW its always tangles even with using conditioner. I could untangle the hair in the shower and still after the shower its tangled still. The blower also releases a burnt smell and the bristles appear burnt. I am not using this again! I'm not sure why this is occurring but I am not the first to complain of the tangles and damage left after using this blower. Yes, it works and yes it cuts the drying time but it can possibly damage your hair health which is not worth it for me. Not worth the price and now I have to do a lot of deep repair hair treatments to fix this.",1,0,B01LSUQSB0

But that typically involved blow drying then straightening or using a curling wand, which takes too long, so I normally just air dry with “meh” results. NO MORE! This thing gives me exactly the soft smooth hair I love after the salon, with minimal effort. The picture is from the first time I used it, and I’m not naturally skilled with hair tools. I highly recommend this, especially for people like me with frizzy or that in between curly-wavy-straight hair. Now I can trick the general public into thinking I’m an adult who knows what I’m doing with my hair! Game. Changer.",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"This has made my hair styling so much easier after using a brush roller and dryer for years. It is a perfect product except:
1. The on/off switch is very inconveniently located, sometimes making it hard to turn on or off while it is still in my hair. This is important, especially when it gets very hot. Which leads me to2, below.
2. While I haven’t used it for long, and my hair looks great, I am concerned that the heat it puts out may damage hair over time. So far so good, but it is really much stronger than a regular hairdryer. If it’s on your neck in the wrong position you want to find the on off switch really quickly, which brings up the problem discussed in number 1.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I have the Revlon paddle brush version of this dryer and wanted to try out the round brush to see what it'll do for my 4a natural kinky wavy coily afro hair. I wanted to see if I could get a big textured curly blowout look instead of just flat straight with a flat iron or textured voluminous straight I get with the paddle brush dryer.

I tested the dryer on a small section of hair. I still have to use a pik attachment on a reg hair dryer to get the roots smooth and dry because my hair is so thick. After that I used the round brush dryer on the length. Eh, it stretched my hair and gave it a *slight* curl/bump, but nothing spectacular. I'll have to update when I do my entire head.",4,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I am a klutz. I am a klutz with very thick hair. I am a klutz with thick hair and no ability to hold a dryer in one hand and a brush in the other and coordinate their use. Enter this dryer/brush. I can use it. I can style my own hair. My stylist is impressed when I come in and my hair looks decent ( she has been doing my hair for thirty years). I bend from the waist, dry the underside, I straighten out and dry the rest, then I flip the ends under. Takes me about 45 minutes to do a good job, thirty minutes to do a “ good enough” job. I recently bought a second one of these for my daughter. This thing is a serious work horse.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I'm on my third hair dryer in 11 months. After about -6 months, the little rubber bits on the bristles started falling off the 1st one really fast, more and more fell off with each use, making it uncomfortable to use. I reached out to Helen of Troy who sent me a refund check, that was cool. I then bought a 2nd one, and in under 3 months of use 5x/week (5 minutes per use) the 2nd hair dryer suddenly stopped getting hot. So now I'm on my third. I'm going to email Helen of Troy about the 2nd one and see if they will send another refund for it, and/or if they can improve the product. When my 3rd (or 4th) one breaks I'm just going to buy a better quality, more expensive machine. I think you really get what you pay for here.",2,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I have super frizzy hair and hated how much time I spent between blow drying and then flat ironing. I bought the Revlon One step hair dryer on a whim after seeing an ad for a knock off pop up in my feed. I really wasn't expecting it to be as great as the video in the ad but if it did OK it could save me some time on 'down days'. But it actually makes my hair straighter but with volume than drying and then flay ironing. My hair feels healthier. AND I SAVE TIME. Never thought it would work this well. Pleasantly surprised. Plan on buying 2 more for my daughters going to college this year.
Tips: let your hair air dry some. I used to keep my hair in a towel until I was ready to work on it. Letting it down to dry some cuts down on time. If you need to start drying it right away just brush the brush through all sides of your hair until it is 'damp dry' before you start curling it under. If you start trying to curl it under with your hair completely wet it takes less time than a hair dryer and then flat iron but takes a lot more time then brushing hap haphazardly until damp dry.
It takes practice pulling your hair away from your head without touching the tip of the brush. I burnt my fingers a few times after the brush got hot.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Fair enough, I’ve only used it twice. But I am soooooo impressed!!! I’m in a fb group that has been obsessed with this thing for nearly a year.

I confess I’m a little snobby and I honestly didn’t think Revlon was going to be able to do something my salon products couldn’t.

I have long, thick, wavy hair. Even with my fancy salon hair dryer it can take more than thirty minutes to dry my hair. And after that I best not even attempt and flat ironing my hair anytime soon because my hair will still be too damp.

Omg... the first time I used this tool and was just playing around... my hair was dry AND straight in 17 minutes and the ends laid nice. Tonight it took only 8 minutes.

I am not easily impressed, but this things has blown my mind with its awesomeness.

Zero snagging or tangling!
Zero feeling clumsy and awkward.

I recommend it 1000%!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Just wow! I was skeptical at first. I wish I would have bought this sooner! After showering I get all the moisture I can out of my hair. And leave it kind of air dry while I’m getting ready, having coffee or whatever I’m doing that morning. It takes me about 7 minutes to dry my hair if that! I have very thick naturally curly hair. It’s is a fabulous tool to have in your arsenal! May be the only one I have to use. No flat iron needed as of yet! Would buy again in a heartbeat!",5,3,B01LSUQSB0
I am always hesitant with these because I think we have 500 hair tools so I got my girls each a different one for Christmas after watching many different you tube videos about them ON ALL HAIR TYPES TOO LOL we all have different hair. So it’s never easy in this house we all need different stuff NOT NOW I BOUGHT 3 more exact same ones we use daily I was blown away! Takes 5 mins to dry your hair even if it’s super thick and long it’s quicker than ever and it glides right out even if your hair isn’t soft. Never got it stuck yet. The volume that it gave my thin limp hair was so nice it even feels thick and like u just left the salon,5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I was skeptical of the reviews because I tend to find some of these more ""gimicky"" products which combine 2 things into 1 to not be nearly as good as if they were separate. MY MISTAKE. Like others have noted, this product cuts my blowout time in at LEAST 1/2! It may even be closer to 1/3 of the time I would usually spend blowdrying my hair straight. I have very curly hair, although somewhat fine, and this really does the job. The one caveat is that it is LARGE so if you have ""baby hairs"" around your hairline, it's hard to get to them so you'll need to use a straightener for those. All in all, this is an AMAZING product and the value of it quite honestly blew my mind.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"As my title suggests, this item is WAY too loud for daily morning use if you live within a 2 mile radius to anyone else. It dries, yes, but with my thick hair.. by the time it’s dried, your neck is so sweaty that you’ve basically gotta go through it again. The styling is not easy for long, thick hair. I didn’t find that this product straightened my slightly wavy hair without multiple pass throughs and really wouldn’t recommend this to anyone with thick hair past their shoulders.",2,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I have curly/wavy hair that is very easy to manipulate. Even though I have curly hair, if I brush it back and put it in a bun it'll get straight. Straightening my hair using the Revlon one step dryer was long and tedious yet my hair wasn't straight. I still had to use a straightener to get the top on my hair smoothed out. When I blow dry my hair with a blow dryer and brush I don't need to go over it with a straightener. I think that the hot air blowing through the brush made the bristles melt and wasn't brushing through my hair anymore by the time i got half way done. Mind you I parted my hair in small pieces since my hair is curly. 0/10",1,One,B01LSUQSB0
"So here's the thing about me- I hate to style my hair. It takes forever because my hair is thick and long. My hair always ends up in a bun by the end of the day. I just don't have the time or the desire to do my hair. It always feels like a chore.

Not anymore!! This product is amazing!! I wiffle-waffled about buying this because I thought it would just be another tool that I would be disappointed in because it wouldn't work on my hair. Oh contrare!!! I used this for the first time and it only took me about 8 min to completely dry my hair. My hair looks fabulous. This will be a frequently used tool going forward. I love it! It's easy to use and it drys my hair super fast.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"First off - I have thick long hair that tends to be frizzy when I use most hairdryers and especially if left to air dry. I used this for the first time and had a salon style in less than 20 minutes. I may have spent more time on the first time use so I timed myself the second time after air-drying my hair for about 15 minutes. Once I started the REVLON One-Step Hair Dryer it took me just over 12 minutes to dry/style my hair.
I also don't wash my hair every day and this provides a lasting style for at least 2-3 days. I still have the option to curl my hair once dried, but most days I don't need anything else to get my hair looking fabulous without taking forever. My regular hair dryer would take at least 15 minutes to dry, then I had to spend more time styling and working the frizz out with either a straightener or curling iron. This simplifies it all with the proper hair products as well.",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"Okay so I’m sure that the problems I had were user error and not the fault of the dryer at all 😂. So I watched a YouTube video to figure out how to use it before starting. I have decently long hair, it’s down to my elbow when straight, so I was worried about getting it all dry in time and when i tried to brush the section of hair down then roll it back up to hold it and dry it got a little difficult because my hair was wrapped around it a couple of times which, again, I’m pretty sure is just user error here, so I had to deviate a little from what I had seen in that first video. I also tried the cool setting and didn’t notice that much of a temperature change, I have a different dryer that when on cool it just feels like room temperature air or cooler coming at me but this still felt kind of hot. However I did end up being able to get all of my hair dry before it started to dry on its own aside from one small section that dried and kinked before I got to it, but again, first time use and user that doesn’t know much. HOWEVER my hair looked great! It was all straight like using a straightener but instead of being smooshed and flat like when using a straightener it was fuller and way better than any time using a different tool. Love it!",4,0,B01LSUQSB0
It gets way too hot. I bought it in June 2020 and the motor went today (November 2020),1,5,B01LSUQSB0
"Had my eye on this for a while, finally snagged it on prime day. I don’t think it’s worth full price.
Pros: 1. My hair is incredibly soft after use. 2. It doesn’t quite give my hair a blown out look but it is pretty straight.
Cons: 1. I literally have to pre-dry my hair with a regular blow drier first to make this worth it. 2. This thing is heavy. Plus the barrel is so wide and flat that if I don’t pre-dry, my roots are still damp cause the barrel can’t reach them. 3. It blows hot air everywhere. My body is dripping with sweat by the time I get done.
If I get more experience with it and the experience improves, I will update this review.",3,One,B01LSUQSB0
"It does dry hair for myself and all of my daughters much faster than a regular blow dryer and is much easier to use. It does not dry completely...even separating hair, it is hard to get dry fully at the scalp.
I have 4 daughters....all with completely different hair types.
My daughter with straight thin hair...this does temporarily add body, but it does not hold.
My daughter with extremely frizzy, poofy thick hair....this temporarily does help with frizz, but again it does not hold on it’s own....a style and products have to also be used in conjunction.
My hair is straight/wavy with some frizz....this has no effect on my hair.
My other two daughters both have extremely curly hair, one thick, one thin....I don’t use this to fully dry or style their hair....so I can’t comment on that.
I’ve seen no signs of damage from this...and the product continues to be in working order although used by a household of girls, consistently.
I do like the ease and speed in which it dries hair, so for that I gave the 4 stars.",4,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I have used this hot brush twice now and so far I rate it 4 stars. It's lightweight, easy to use and dries your hair very fast. The reason I knocked 1 star off is because it made my hair extremely frizzy. I had to smooth the fly aways down with hairspray after styling it. But overall it is nice because it saves time and gives a pretty nice style. It gave my roots excellent lift and made my hair look fuller!",4,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I absolutely love this blow dryer!!!! It would seem like it's going to be heavy but it's not. I have thick medium to fine hair and I am really bad at using a hair brush and blow dryer cause I'm not coordinated. But with this combo you dont have to be. It makes me look like I spent all day doing my hair while I'm reality it only took 25 minutes. About 15 minutes less than blowdring it the other way. And with the other way I would have to add another 15 minutes to use a straightener or curling iron. With this I only need to use it and nothing else. It made my hair soft shiny and have bounce to it, which I could never do with a brush and blow dryer. I use it on the low setting cause I never like to use the high settings on any styling tool and even on low it dried my hair fast. My hair held the curl for 5 days. It was crazy my hair doesn't usually do that. It normaly falls flat in a day maybe two at the max. I can't stop running my fingers through my hair. It really does make it look like a blow out from a salon. My hair with a regular blow drier will frizz and look dry. And I used the same product on my hair with this oval blowdryer brush as I do with my regular one. Definitely worth the price to have in your styling arsenal!!!! Thank you Revlon for making this. Now I'm happy to do my hair every day!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"First of all, I’ve seen reviews saying this ruined your hair or caused a lot of breakage- yes, like with ANY hot tool, that can happen. So use in moderation and with heat protection. Okay now in the picture the words are already rubbing off- this is a first time use. It’s kinda loud for those who have thin walls and gets really hot. If you have short/ medium length hair like me, be careful it can burn your neck. It was kinda burning my ears and side of my face if I got any close. I just wish you could control temperature it would’ve been perfect. Otherwise it gets too hot for me to use comfortably. It does give me more volume than a flatiron would do and it takes less time than a flat iron would. Gets the job done pretty quick. I can see me still using this in the future every once in a while. Not often. It doesn’t really get the roots though- unless I’m using this incorrectly? So I would have a flat iron on hand for those parts.",3,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I have zero patience for drying my hair. It's long and thick, and I would always just go to bed after my showers and wake up looking like the Bride of Frankenstein. This thing is a game changer!!!! I let my hair air dry for about an hour, and then this thing gets it fully dry in about eight minutes. (I'm guessing if I tried to dry it right after my shower it would take more than twenty minutes, and again, no patience for that.) I know several reviews say it's too hot, but I always dry my hair on the medium setting and don't have that issue. I also don't think it's too loud. I do use a thermal spray before I use it, just to be safe. My hair always comes out looking fantastic.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"BUT NOW I DO! I have extremely thick, curly/wavy hair and it takes me forever to get ready between the drying and straightening.

I was hesitant to spend the money knowing I could do it in two steps at home, but no regrets on this purchase at all.

The level of sound is pretty much as loud as a hair dryer. This sucker is a lot bigger than anticipated, which is fine, because it's not heavy and it does a lot of hair at once.

The pictures shows my half dried half damp hair that I slept in the night before in a bun. (disclaimer I just received this so I have not yet used it on totally wet hair).

My hair is unconditioned and a little dry from chemicals, so don't hold the slightly frizzy look of my hair against the dryer.

It usually takes me about 10-15 minutes to do all of my hair, but I did this in 5 minutes! Again, hair was not completely wet, just damp, but STILL.

If this lasts a reasonable amount of time, it's a game changer for me.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"First off I am terrible at blow drying my hair and I very rarely do anything more than throwing my wet hair into a bun. But I am looking for change.
Hair type: very thick 2c/3a curly hair lots of frizz
Protection: Loreal blow dry it thermal smoother cream
Temp: low setting finish off with strokes using the cool
Time: 30 minutes
So this was very easy to use. Seriously if I can use it so can you. Noise level is right in line with a typical hair dryer nothing extreme. I used it while my daughter was napping in the room across the hall and she didn't wake up. The metal does get hot after a while just like a hair dryer. The brush isn't the easiest to clean out when you're done but that is to be expected with bristles like that and long hair. On the brightside it did not tangle once. I will be using this again and using smaller sections.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I have fine, curly hair but a lot of it that is prone to frizz. I bought this solely due to the reviews and wow, it did not disappoint! I really didn't expect this to work and while I fully expected my hair to get caught and tangled in it, it straightens my hair *almost* without needing to curl it with an iron and it NEVER tangles my hair. I have burnt my hand once or twice on where I hold it but overall, I can't believe how wonderfully it works. SOOOO happy with it.
2 negatives:
It is LOUD
It is HEAVY
I wouldn't take it on vacation for that reason alone but wow, is it worth it? Absolutely!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Let me start off by saying I have natural, thick, ""latina"" hair. In other words - coarse and curly. Since I want what I cant have, I always straighten it. From blow dry to straightening to curling the ends, it takes me a good hour and a half to do my shoulder length hair! WHAT A PAIN! I've suffered for years and years doing it that way - until I saw someone I follow on Instagram recommend this product. Ironically, I used to use something similar to this (just had a smaller barrel) years ago from a different brand. I also had been looking in stores for a blow brush but couldn't find one I liked. Then, I saw her recommend this and she has waist length hair! I saw how quickly she did her hair and I was sold! It came quickly and I finally tried it last night. LADIES. THIS. IS. A. GAME. CHANGER!!! I literally did my hair in less than 10 minutes! This tool replaced my ENTIRE previous hour and a half routine and reduced it to TEN MINUTES! NO BS!!!! I'd show you a pic but I just woke up and my hair is all over the place heh. But for real, if this works this well for me, it'll work wonders for you too! Don't sleep on this! (the only thing that made me angry was that it literally went on sale for like $15 less about 2-3 days after I bought it! ARGH!)",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"It takes a lot of getting used too. I have limited use of my right hand and hoped this would help cut down my drying/styling time. It made my hair look really smooth, but didnt cut down on my time since small sections need to done at a time and I have long/thick hair. But, but...the BAD was that I should've heeded the reviews.... broke after 4th use. I didn't use it that often so on the 4th use, when it broke, it was past the return timeframe. Motor gave totally gave out. What a huge disappointment. I think the seller should make this right.",1,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I could not wait to try this out!!!!! I washed my hair (even though I washed it yesterday) just so I could try this out. I have medium curly hair and the high speed was too hot so I did my entire head on low. Normally, to dry and flat iron it takes me 3 hours. This took me maybe 45 minutes. I still need to get used to it but I love it!!! My hair has some wave to it, and it has some body! I normally flat iron it straight but I did buy some extensions and it blends perfectly. If you’re like me and wanting to try it, you won’t be disappointed!!! I can’t wait to use this more and really get the hang of it!!!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I am so in love with this product. I dont know why I never seen these before in my life. (I am now 36 yrs old) Normally, it takes like 45 min to fully blow dry my hair. My hair is very thick and long. I saw this product on a hair tutorial and I thought ""I must buy one"". IN LOVE! My hair is dry in about 20-25min now and it does a great job. My hair is very wavy, though my hair isnt 100% straight, I am left with some waves but compared to normally blow drying and brushing my hair, I am normally left with a fro mess. But this product controls most of the frizz I have and makes my hair about 90-95% straight so I dont have to use a flat ironmuch to get the parts I missed which are the back of my head by roots.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
I was skeptical about this product for the sheer size but WOW! It is very easy to use. Dries my hair in under 6 minutes...AND styles!! I can get amazing blow outs with this and I don’t need to add additional damages to my hair using a curling iron or flat iron. THAT’S A HUGE PLUS!! It isn’t heavy like I thought it would be and it is so nice not having to balance using a brush AND blow dryer at the same time. The brush is great at holding the hair where it should be and I can work up a good shine. I only wish it had a cold shot button because the dial is a little tricky to switch back and forth when you are styling. I have been recommending this to every one I know!!,5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"Bought this because we have *four* daughters and my husband is learning how to do their hair. This blow dryer is a lot easier for him than round brushing and dries faster as well since it is drying from every angle.

The product itself gets very hot if you use it for too long. What I have found works best for us is to use the regular blowdryer to dry all the roots, then let the hair air dry until it is 90-95% dry on its own. Then finish the last 5% with this blowdryer. It gives it good volume and a really nice shape without having to follow up with any straighteners or curling irons.

Because it does overheat I wouldn’t recommend it as the only blowdryer you own, but using it as a finishing product works great for us",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Hello my fellow Amazon shoppers,
I have purchased this product with major research on it before coming to my decision. Look no further, buy this product if you have trouble with doing arm day for just blowing out your hair and taking long hours to finish. This is the product for you, if you want to decrease time and much effort to just end with a soar arm afterwards.
Pros: cons:
-Great with thick and -Price
thin hair types
- worth the money
- can definitely work on curly hair
I myself am a girl with curls
who just won't cooperate
- spend less time to do what
a pro can do.
- I have several months using
It and all of us women
In my household love it!!!

If anyone has a problem with spending too much and taking long durations of time at a salon, than look no further and buy this product because so far it is my go to. I definitely recommend for those mainly want to do self hair dry at the comfort of their own home with less time.",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I love this product. I have thick, wavy hair that is on the corse side. I blow dry most of the way with a traditional hair dryer after putting a leave in conditioner on.

"I've never been able to round brush and blowdry my hair at the same time. I don't know if it's the lack of coordination on my part or what - but despite the number of times I've tried, I can never do it.

My normal routine would be to let my hair air dry - or would be to blow dry and then straighten which would take forever. my hair is super thick despite it being only shoulder length.

I tried this out the day it arrived, and i am BLOWN away. I've told all of my friends to get it. It's so easy to use, and I could cry from joy from having perfectly blown out hair that has ZERO frizz and doesn't require me to straighten after. definitely purchase this if you're on the fence!!!

for reference - my hair is shoulder length, super thick, and naturally frizzy and wavey",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Okay, this really is a game changer! I honestly did not think it would live up to the hype. I almost purchased the $500 Dyson tool that was supposed to do the same thing and I got this on a Black Friday sale for a little over $30 and I thought there was no way that something that was so much less expensive would be able to style my hair amazingly. Boy was I wrong! I have that really unattractive not really curly not really straight frizzy wrinkly hair that you have to put all kinds of product in and style in order for it to look half decent. I am quite uncoordinated and so never could quite master the skill of using a hair dryer with a round brush, so I would just use a hair dryer and a flat iron, but that is very time-consuming and I would still have frizzy spots that were hard to manage. Or I would put in curl product and diffuse my hair to try and make my waves"""" more defined and less frizzy. I know this product already has a gajillion reviews, and it is a busy day for me but I am taking the time to encourage whoever is reading this to give it a go! It is shockingly mind-boggling to me how well it works. I feel like I can do my hair and it looks just like when I get my hair highlighted at the salon and it is professionally styled. I have had multiple people comment on how much better my hair looks ever since I purchased this product! It is so ridiculously good I have told multiple people that they should try it. You have nothing to lose It's so amazing! Totally worth it given the low cost compared to say the Dyson $500 one! I just uploaded two photos, one to show my natural hair and one to show my hair after I used this Revlon dryer brush. there should be obvious that my natural hair texture is hideous! Very hard to work with. This tool makes it so smooth and non-frizzy It's fantastic! At the risk of blabbering on and repeating myself I'm just going to stop and say go buy it!!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0

I was a little skeptical of the reviews before I purchased this hair dryer. I thought it couldn't be that great because I have been disappointed with all if not most of any hair styling or drying tools I've ever used in my life. I have long thick hair with soft curls. Typically it takes me 1.5 hours to straighten my hair or do a blowout. Not to mention, for a tomboy like me, it's HARD. YOU GUYS. IT TOOK ME 10 MINUTES TO DO MY HAIR PERFECTLY WITH THIS DRYER!!

"I love this dryer! It works so well with a heat protectant to make my hair so smooth! This was recommended by a friend so when it when on sale I bought one for my mom and myself. We have different types of hair and hair styles but we both love it! She has always has dry looking hair and I have a lot of fine hair. It works perfectly for both of us.
I started getting compliments on my smooth hair almost the same day I started using it.

If you let your hair air dry for a bit It works super fast! The heat protectant is a must. I tried the one that Amazon recommended along with this and it works great.The high setting is pretty hot. The low setting works great for me! I can flip my head and use this when I’m running late and my hair still looks smooth! The volume it gives my hair is surprising because I have a lot of fine hair. I can’t say enough good things about this product!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"This dryer/styler does a few things well -- it dries quickly, creates a lot of volume, and straightens and smooths your hair well. But there's more cons than pros I think. -- It needs to have a medium heat control -- low is too cool, high is way too hot, and to me the cool option, which it has, is useless. -- The dial that you switch between the settings is very hard to use -- it's hard to grip and hard to move it by just one click. -- The whole barrel portion that has the bristles on gets extremely hot -- way to hot for safety in my opinion -- the little end piece at the top with no bristles is the only place you can touch to handle it with without getting burned after it's been operating for a few minutes, so it becomes awkward to use. I used it a few times, but now it's been sitting in the drawer unused for a few weeks, so I'm guessing this is a pretty much wasted purchase for me unfortunately.",2,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Bought this for my tween daughter for Xmas as she has a hard time utilizing a brush and blow dryer at the same time. I’ve wound up using it just as much as she has! It’s a great tool that requires no skill and your hair actually comes out looking like you got it done at the salon. The brush doesn’t tangle and I feel like it’s the right amount of heat for something that gets close to your head. The only reason I’m not giving 5 stars is because it’s a little heavier than I expected and by the time I’m done drying my thick, long hair, my lower arm muscle is sore lol. I will say it’s cut my drying time in half though! Great product and very happy I purchased",4,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Very pleased. My hair is natural, what you might call 4C, AKA dries into a dense afro if not manipulated. I had (still have) the paddle, but I did have issues getting to my roots with that. And straight hair with kinky roots didn't really do it for me. So I figured this would be my next step. And wow... I had put it in 6 braids for less than an hour to help the drying, and ensure that it was well detangled. Then I put on some heat protectant and dried my hair. There's only Cool, Low, or High, but High isn't horribly hot while still be effective, so my hand could be in the area without being scared like a regular blow dryer. I used hot on a section first, then finished with cool. It all finished pretty quickly, and I am soooo happy.",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"Just buy it! I debated for a long time before buying this dryer, but I should have bought it sooner. I have fine, thin, shoulder-length hair, and this dryer gives it the boost it needs. I watched several YouTube videos before trying it out. I was able to achieve a smooth, sleek style in 10 minutes the first time I tried it. No frizz, no fly-aways, and no ripped-out hair. Very satisfied customer!",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I’ve been wanting to buy one of these for a while, because I thought that it would make life easier to dry/style my hair. The brush head is shaped like an oval, which doesn’t make a lot of sense to me. I wonder if it would be better if it were round. Using it with a lower setting makes it easier to handle, but using it on high felt really hot, and felt like it was burning my hair. So I guess it’s OK to use once in a while, but I don’t think this will be a regular styling tool for me.",4,One,B01LSUQSB0
"Bought this for my wife. She has used hair dryers her whole life, and most are pretty loud but its only for a few minutes, right? But this thing sounds like a jet turbine. I mean its so loud I have to leave the room. I can hear it clear across the other side of the house, even if it go into the garage. ITS LOUD.

I don't think its a defect because otherwise it works fine but the motor is small and contained in the handle, so it must spin pretty darn fast to make up for the larger motor in most other hair dryers. And its not just the magnitude of sound but the pitch as well, like a thousand fingernails scraping a blackboard.",1,0,B01LSUQSB0
Holy smokes!!! This is the Best Buy of my entire year! I am terribly at doing my hair and traditionally make a weekly dry bar trip where they said they were coming out with their version of this brush. It’s $150 which is insane. This one - much more reasonably priced is perfect. It takes me an hour between drying and straightening and this took 17 minutes and was completely straight. Did you read that. 17 minutes. I now have time to read a bit in the morning before I head out (or sleep in!). This is a perfect daily use tool. Highly recommend ditching the hair dryer and giving this a go.,5,3,B01LSUQSB0
"OK so I was very unsure about ordering this. I have a $170 blow dryer that I love. But after seeing so many people use this I decided to just go for it. I love it! My hair is pretty thin so I have to use a low setting. The high setting makes my hair fry. But I’m totally OK with that. I actually brought this to my bachelorette party and no joke, every single girl ordered it that day. Everyone was obsessed with it! Even the girls with super thick hair. My only recommendation, and I think other people have said this, is to let your hair mostly dry first. Especially at the roots. Because it’s really hard to get your roots dry with this thing. Usually I use it about an hour",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I love love love this hair tool! Little back story. I have never used heat on my hair before or styled my own hair. I usually let it air dry and it's pretty curly/wavy, and I like it like that but sometimes I just want a sleeker look but I don't want to straighten it because that is 1. Too much work and 2. A LOT of heat. This tool is perfect for anyone really! This gives me a sleek look without doing too many steps (i.e blow drying and straightening). I can get my hair done in 30 mins or less and it looks soooooo good!! 😊 I hate using heat on my hair though so when I use this occasionally, not daily or even weekly, I only use it on low heat not cool just the 2nd heating option, I've used it on high once and it definitely dries quicker but it does get much hotter and I just don't think it's worth putting that much heat to my hair. But I love it! I'd recommend this to anyone looking to easily style their hair without so much hassle.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I have really thick straight hair, and it takes forever to blowdry, even when cut chin or shoulder length. I picked this up because of the numerous reviews, and as a Prime Day special, i couldn't pass up the chance to try. Let me tell you, it works. You do need to be careful as the aluminum barrel will get hot and can burn you (remember old fashioned curling irons? yeah, similar to that, not as harsh). However, it will not burn your hair, and will cut down the drying time significantly. My shoulder length hair normally takes 40 minutes to dry thoroughly (needs to be thorough with thick hair, otherwise the frizz)...I was able to jump out of the shower, towel off my wet hair, and dry it in 20 minutes flat. It is an amazing feat. And the fact that i don't have to juggle a brush in one hand, and a dryer in the other, is an added bonus. Truly love this and recommend if you have thick straight hair",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I freely admit this was definitely an impulse buy. I stumbled upon it on one of the many, “393 Things on Amazon You DEFINITELY DO NOT NEED, But Have Amazing Reviews” articles on social media. And let me just say that they were spot on- I had no NEED for this drying/styling tool. But it was reasonably priced AND had well over 100,000 positive reviews. Plus, with free returns through Amazon Prime, I figured I didn’t have anything to lose.

For anyone that has long hair that they straighten- this tool is a game changer!! I have very curly hair that I blow dry & then straighten. All together with my conventional blow dryer & flat iron, it would take me 90-120 minutes to do this. Then I received my Revlon & have been able to cut my styling time down to just at an hour!!

The first time I used this, I was FLOORED at how straight it got my hair!! Instead of my hair being dry & frizzy it was shiny & healthy.

I do still use my flat iron because this styler doesn’t get right next to my scalp, but it definitely has cut the amount of time & heat I use on my hair. The styler is very easy to use, comparable to a blow dryer as far as noise output, sturdy & extremely reasonably priced.

I’ve only used my styler three times, but I’m seriously in love with it & don’t foresee myself going back to the traditional way of drying with a blow dryer & brush.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"So this will dry your hair QUICK FAST AND IN A HURRY but careful you don't burn your hair in the process. It is supposed to have temperature control but honestly that is is airspeed control not temp. High is lots of air and very hot temps, low is less air but still very hot temps and cool is more of what a low temp setting would be, it is definitely not a COOL shot you would normally use to set a blowout with. I wouldn't recommend to anyone with fine hair as it is too likely to burn your strands.",2,One,B01LSUQSB0
"Let me start by saying I have fine, thin hair. I really liked the idea of this dryer. I think it would have worked fabulously for me if the lowest setting wasn’t so hot and I could control the settings with my thumb (like on a regular hairdryer). Since the lowest setting was so hot for me, I felt like I was burning my hair. When I wanted to turn it off I had to use two hands because the bottom twisted to change settings. If you have thicker hair, the heat will probably be fine, but for my fine hair, it was too much. Darn.",3,3,B01LSUQSB0
"First, I LOVE the idea of this product. It allows me to dry and style my hair at the same time (eliminating the need for a straightener afterwards!) and it's easy to use. I am NOT a ""hair person"" so I'm always thrilled when something is easy for me to use. BUT...I wish it had a few other features. The BIGGEST thing to me is that there isn't a temperature control on it. There's a hot and a cool setting, but there's no way to use a cooler heat. And it gets HOT. I just wish there was a high heat and low heat setting. It's also a little hard to target my roots. There's no way to make that easier that I can think of, but it's hard to completely dry my whole head. Overall, I love it. I use it every time I dry my hair now.",3,One,B01LSUQSB0
"As much as I like the idea of this brush/hair dryer, it got so hot and made my hair so hot I couldn't even touch my hair. I was really afraid it was going to burn my hair. So I bought one with the ion system per advice from my hair dresser. I bought this because I was tired of trying to dry my hair with a hair dryer in one hand and styling brush in the other. It’s pretty bulky but I’m getting used to it. Just a word of warning...don’t touch the end tip because it’s really hot! Also try to keep your hand off where the bristles come out because that’s hot too. I have a lot of hair, chin length that is thick and course so this is really helping smooth my hair out.",3,0,B01LSUQSB0
"My hair is thick, coarse and somewhat long - just past my shoulders. (I am italian...) I have ALWAYS struggled with trying to straighten my naturally curly hair. As I entered my 40s, the curls just didn't look good and I felt like a frazzled old lady, so I began straightening it regularly. I have tried everything, but could never get really good results unless I got a professional blow out. A hot air curling brush was my favorite solution- but they break easily. The brushes are usually small and clip on, so they are not sturdy against hair like mine. This brush is all one piece, so it doesn't have that weak point to break.
I have been using this brush for a few days with AMAZING results!! Soft, silky and 100x better than and blowout I usually give myself. My hair looks and feels like I got a professional blowout! The brush is large which is why I think it works so well for hair like mine. If you have fine hair or short hair, it might not work as well. But I l LOVE the results I am getting!",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I LOVE this heat styler. I've never been the best at styling my hair with a blow-dryer and round brush. This is so much easier to use. You essentially just brush your hair!
My hair is really fine, so it takes almost no time to dry it with this. I can even use it on my short bangs, which I didn't expect!
The styler is a lot bigger in person than I expected, but I think it weighs a little less than my blow dryer. The oval shape definitely makes it easier to get closer to the scalp. There's a lot of power in this styler! I don't think I'll be going back to the blow dryer after this",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
I'm still learning how to use it! I can say when I blow dry my hair with a regular blow dryer and round brush it definitely damages my hair way more then the one step! I don't need to use it on high at all because I don't have thick hair. Works quickly. I have not figured out how to give my hair as much volume wth this though. That could definitely change wth practice! I do really like it already.. and I've only used it 2 times! So glad I purchased it! It also had a 10 dollar of coupon attached to it via Amazon prime so it was definitely worth the money! Update.. use this almost daily and still loving it!,5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"This product started to sound funny and smell like something was burning after the 3rd use. By the 4th use it stopped working completely. I’m exchanging to hope that I got a defective one, but will return if I get the same results. Seemed too good to be true. The product would be awesome if it worked.",1,3,B01LSUQSB0
"This brush is great product if you want to just go to the office or not have to use a flat iron. to speed up the process, I blow dry my hair a little with the regular dryer, then use the volumizer.

Pros: Gives your hair nice volume; no need to use a separate brush and separate dryer since it's all-in-one.

Cons: No big body wave (when I blow dry my hair the old fashion way with a brush and dryer, I can create big voluminous curls when I brush inward or outward. This brush did not do that. It was kind of straight with a little hint of a waive at the end, but nothing so noticeable); it is heavy and your arms may get tired quick; you have to be really careful where you place your other hand to grab the other end of the dryer, you can burn your thumb. If its humid just a tad, your hair will poof and frizz.

Overall: not a bad product for the price, but definitely not something I would use if you want some banana curls or no frizz.",3,One,B01LSUQSB0
"Guys. GUYS. I just had a baby 3 months ago. I know this doesn’t seem related but wait for it.

This dryer brush thingy is LIFE CHANGING. No kidding. I legit have a beautiful blowout in 18 minutes. My hair is usually SO hard to blowdry. We’re talking 40 minutes, and not consistently beautiful because let’s face it.... hair does what it wants.

I’ve used this brush 3 times so far. Each time my hair is legitimately perfect. I look like I walked out of a salon.

I have no time to do my hair for 40 minutes. This legit cut it in HALF and it looks beautiful! I’m loving this brush dryer thingy. You need it ladies. Trust me. I’d be a spokesperson if they’d let me!

Honestly the coolest part of it is that the baby loves the sound it makes, so she sort of stares at me while I do my hair, too. 👌🏼 No crying, and pretty hair? Sign me up!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"This has changed my life! Well, my hair’s life at least, this is so easy to use and it gives my hair such great volume, I feel like I’ve just got my hair styled at the salon. If my hair is very wet it, I dry it first with my regular hair dryer and then finish it off with this one. It does make your hair very hot and so I am careful to keep it moving and have my hair nearly dry before I use it. And then I clean it after every use to make sure that there is no problem with build-up. But I do recommend this and think it is safe to use as long as you keep it clean and are careful how long you have it on your hair.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"The device looks fancy, but i couldnt use it because the cable and voltage are not the ones used overseas.
They should have sent an adaptor with it knowing that the shipping is not inside the U.S.
I would have gladly paid for the adaptor. Now i have the device but i cant use it :(

For those who order this device outside U.S.A. beware of the voltage issue, get an adaptor before you plug it in.

And for Revelon; you need to customize according to your clients different needs, either by manufacturing plugs that fits in other countries, or adding an adaptor, just like most computer companies do nowadays. Not burdening us like this. My comment is not an evaluation of the product, i didnt even use it yet.. it is about the voltage issue and shipping to overseas customers.",3,0,B01LSUQSB0
"This is a very awkward piece of hair styling equipment. In one Ad it shows 2 pieces. Like one piece is a dryer and one piece is a comb. Apparently, this is to show you the inside of this. It does not come apart. It is bulky and hard to figure out exactly the process for straightening your hair. This is NOT a dryer / straightener. The instructions that come with this product clearly state, use only on dry hair. I tried finagling this thing for about an hour. You can straighten small pieces of hair by sort of acting like your coming your hair.
I would not recommend this product. I returned mine.",1,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Update: I contacted the support co listed and they’re sending a replacement which is appreciated. This worked great until it died today! I’ve only used 6 times in 3 months!

Update post replacement:
After 2 uses, the new replacement dryer stopped blowing hot air altogether. Very disheartening. I’ve reached out yet again to the warranty company.

All in all, I don’t recommend buying this. Clearly there are electrical issues in the product itself. Awesome concept and wish it lasted, but not worth the $.",1,2,B01LSUQSB0
"I can’t live without this blow dryer anymore! I have no been good at styling my hair; especially since it’s long, curly, and incredibly thick.
This blow dryer makes straightening a breeze! From what used to be about 1.5 hours, it now it’s approximately 20 minutes (and that’s if I am going slowly).

For added smoothness or to make it ‘more’ straight, I sometimes go in with the straightener afterwards - this dryer makes flat ironing much easier, too!

It truly has changed my hair game!

I had the ‘original one step’ for about 2.5 years and loved it! Still, it eventually tore - I realized I was storing and wrapping the chord INCORRECTLY.

I’ve had the new version for 3+ months and it’s still (if not more) amazing. The new version swivels/turns where the chord meets the handle (as a means to prevent such damage) - it makes all the difference. Plus I know that I should NEVER WRAP THE CHORD AROUND THE DRYER. There are various ways to store it, I keep my out most of the time, but when I travel I wrap it around my hand and use a twist tie (sometimes a loose scrunchie) and that is far more secure/doesn’t damage the chord.
I did get the storage/travel case when I made this purchase and that piece is amazing, too! Makes it much easier to travel with.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
DO NOT BUY!!!!! Do not buy this product until Revlon has improved quality control. When this hair dryer became really popular they seemed to cut all corners to produce them quickly. My first one lasted a year and performed great. This one lasted ONE MONTH. It just blew up with sparks and fire and my house smells like toxic smoke and burnt chemicals and plastics. Thank goodness I was holding it away to adjust my hair otherwise I could have been burnt or blinded by the sparks. I’ve never written a negative review but people need to know for their safety. DO NOT BUY.,1,2,B01LSUQSB0
"this is my fourth roll brush hair dryer. my very first one was also revlon -- it did an excellent job of smoothing my natural waves but the metal barrel occasionally burned my hands and would snag strands that got caught between the metal and plastic (um OW). i next tried a version that auto-rolled when you pressed the button (omg my hair got caught up in it and knotted) and then the very popular john freida roll brush dryer (just made my hair really frizzy). this current version is, hands-down, the BEST. non-metal barrel that doesn't ever heat up enough to accidentally burn appendages OR painfully snag at my hair. the controls are in a twist ring near the bottom of the handle so you won't ever accidentally switch to another setting during styling. the barrel itself is a huge oval (and i mean HUGE) but it works very well at smoothing and drying. finished styling from wet to dry in less than 10 minutes (i have thick, wavy hair past my shoulder blades). i can now finally wash my hair in the morning and not worry about having no time to style it so that i don't look like a crazy person who stuck my finger in a socket.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"This thing is HUGE! It’s extremely difficult to manipulate because of the sheer ginormity (that’s a word, isn’t it?) of it. I also don’t seem to have long enough hair to actually get it to style with an acceptable amount of volume. My hair is either totally glued to my head or it’s freakishly poofy.
It’s also not easy to cold-set it when I finally manage to style it into something bordering on acceptable. There isn’t a shot of cold button so I have to try and hold this huge thing in my semi-short hair while attempting to turn the heat selector to cool. Picture holding something, twisted into your hair, that is roughly the size of a can of Pringles covered in huge protruding bristles that also happens to be as hot as a curling iron.
This may work for you, especially if you have long hair and man hands. For me, not so much.",3,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I am really glad that I got this, but it is not quite as easy as I was hoping. The barrel is pretty big; I know that the motor had to fit in it, just odd for a product designed for women. I have very small feminine hands and my fingers don't touch around the barrel - that combined with the weight make my hand get tired while drying my hair. This weighs less than my BaByliss Pro, but because of the handle, my hand gets more tired with this. Drying power is great, but I don't love using it on wet hair - maybe I will get used to it, but I prefer the all over heat of a blow dryer to get my hair mostly dry. That being said, this does get my hair looking gorgeous with just enough volume and straightness.",4,3,B01LSUQSB0
"UPDATE: I am withdrawing my 5 star review for this product as I have used it maybe 10 times and I recently experienced sparks from the inside of the drier and it started smoking, I threw the plug out of the outlet to avoid a fire. I don't want to know what would have happened had my hair been around the brush when the sparks came. REVLON please reach out to me - I don't know how to contact your customer service and I want to send my produt back to you for safety testing!

2019: ITS TRUE! This works wonders! Wow my hair looks like it was professionally blown out! I only had to go over each section twice... I did hold at the top for some more volume and intentionally swooped the ends different directions. LOVE THIS!

My hair is naturally very curly, even wen I get out of the shower. Photo is from wet hair > brush > section >revlon tool > Moroccan oil > brushed through",1,One,B01LSUQSB0
"This tool does as advertised, but works best under specific circumstances. For instance, unless you want to spend 30 or more min drying small sections, your hair should be mostly air dried. You also need to consider how to dry directionally to achieve the volume. Consider too if you want your ends flipped in or out. There's a slight learning curve to get used to it but it works at the end of the day. The barrel will get very hot, so watch your hand on it. You cant just store it immediately because it needs to cool down. What's nice though is you cant burn your scalp or ears easily because the brush protects you by about an inch. There are only 2 heat settings.",4,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I debated on whether this was as amazing as everyone said it was. I have shoulder length, fairly kinky hair. This product pretty much dries your hair and gives it body at the same time. It basically brushes and blow dries your hair at the same time. I gave it four stars because I notice the ""cool"" function isn't really cool and I like to ""relax"" my hair when its dry. You also get pretty hot because the heating element is on both sides of the product. It basically blows hot air in your face. The cord is short. I would not say it shortens my drying time by much, if at all. It is also difficult for me to get my roots. You will have to remember to brush reeeaaaallllly slow to make sure each section is dry. But, aside from those negatives, it is a great product. My hair looks great and I am super happy with it. I totally recommend it. BTW, I bought it off the Treasure Truck and received a considerable discount, which made it even better:)",4,0,B01LSUQSB0
"This is the BEST hair dryer/styler on the market. The next day delivery service was speedy. You don't even have to use any other styling tool like a flat iron or curling iron unless you just want to. It really styles your hair as you dry your hair and the amount of volume it adds to your hair is crazy. I have fine thinning hair and this product makes my hair more fuller with lots of volume. I haven't experienced any hair loss or damaged hair by using this tool. It is well worth every penny. I would give 100 stars if I could. One amazing product you won't regret it. If you have fine, thin hair then this is the tool you need.",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"So I’m still not 100% sure how I feel about this hair dryer... on the one hand, the finished product is always nicer looking than if I’d just used a blow dryer to dry my hair. That being said, I was very long, very thick hair that holds on to water for a long time so in the 5-6 times I’ve used this so far, my hair is still a little damp at the end, especially at the roots and in the back. I feel like it doesn’t shorten my blow dry time, but I do like the volume and curl it adds. It also can get quite hot and burn your fingers or ears if you’re not careful. I might try using it next time on almost completely dry hair and see if I like it more that way.",4,One,B01LSUQSB0
"This is absolutely amazing. I have been very uninterested in styling my hair ever since I had kids-- I would rather sleep later and just let my hair air dry, but I have recently gotten to the point where I am realizing that it looks really unprofessional to show up for a meeting with wet hair... insert this product-- I can dry my hair in record time with my hair looking professionally styled and my arms and shoulders aren’t achy by the time I am done. I also love that you don’t need a separate dryer and round brush-- I cannot wait to take this thing on vacation!!!
5 stars all around from me!!!",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I love this thing!! I have very frizzy curly hair (think carrot top or hermione lol) and this thing gets my hair so soft and smooth. I live in Hawaii where it’s 80 degrees, humid, and often rainy and my hair stays frizz free. The closest to a blow out I can get at home. I have long hair, down past my armpits and this only takes me 25 min. I use a small amount of the morrocanoil smoothing lotion before I blow dry and a couple dots of the Aveda smooth infusion styling creme afterwards and my hair smells heavenly for days. The style and softness actually keep for a long time, usually a week or so. The reason I give it 4 stars is just because the ‘high’ setting is unbearably loud, I only use the low and it works fine, but it kind of annoys me that there’s a function that you cannot use because it really is that loud.",4,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I love this dryer. It’s honestly my favorite tool and I highly recommend it. It dries quickly and styles, all in one. I used to take about 45 minutes to dry and style my hair. This dryer takes about 25 minutes to do it all in one, and I have a lot of hair. I have naturally straight, long, medium thick and fine hair that is not too coarse, and is in layers. This dryer leaves my hair shiny, frizz free, and gives my hair that “fresh from the salon” styled look. It gets perfectly hot, beware if you hover too close to your head - it can “burn” (no damage burn, just gets hot). Easy to use, light enough to handle, not too heavy. I had a friend try it to style my hair, she’s a cosmetologist, and she said it’s much easier to use than a blow dryer and round brush. I have even used it on my dry hair/next day hair, and it styles just as great from being wet. I can curl it through my hair effortlessly but I do have to maintain a steady curling motion or it will catch but comes out very easily. I clean stray hair and the bristles of it, using old eyelash wands/spoolies.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
It. Is. Life. Changing. It used to take me 40 mins to blow dry and 40 minutes to straighten. I can now look like I have a blow out in 20 minutes. It’s not hard on the arms like a blow dryer and brush is. I have super thick and wavy/frizzy hair (think... Hagrid from HP) and it works great for me!,5,3,B01LSUQSB0
"I struggled with my hair drying “routine” for years. I would blow dry for 20 mins and then I would straighten for 20 mins... so 40 mins+ after shower. Blowing drying alone would make my hair too puffy and frizzy, so I would use a straightener after. I have THICK HAIR! This was frustrating to me so I looked into alternatives that could save me time. I was unsure if this product would work for me since I have long and thick hair...BUT... it is AMAZING, not only do I save time, I don’t have to use two devices to dry and straighten my hair! It dries really well too. I know there’s people on here that says it’s too hot, but it’s literally a blow dryer.. it’s supposed to be hot. It never burned me or anything. In conclusion, please buy this if you are like me and have thick hair! It works for us too!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"When it comes to using a roll brush and blow dryer, well, For. Get. It. Forget it. Can't do it. And I've tried for decades. Decades, mind you!! I snarl my hair, I can't figure out the mirror-reverse thing, and now I'm old and have some arthritis in my shoulders, so working for so many minutes, and getting so-so results at best, was very frustrating.

Enter the Revlon Hot Air Brush. Surprising that nobody figured this out before. It works very well. My only complaint is that it is very HOT, even on the MEDIUM setting. The LOW setting is very loud so I can't use it; literally hurts my ears. Have not used the HIGH setting yet. I have very fine hair, medium thickness. I get great lift and wave with this item. I looked at a few YouTube videos to learn how to use it well. I am very satisfied; well worth the $50 I spent. (P.S. I did not recieve any freebies from Revlon for this positive review.)",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"This cut my drying time in half! I have medium length, fine hair and I have alot of it. And it has a natural wavy. So if I want straight hair, it was 40 minutes with a blow dryer & brush. And that's with damp hair, not sopping wet out of the shower hair. Using this, my hair is straight, smooth & dry in 20 mins or less. That's using it on low. Only took 10 mins more with just out of the shower wet hair. Best part, is that hot air from the dryer isn't blowing all around me so the air in the room isn't getting hot. And my head isn't getting hot from the dryer. I'm so glad I got it.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I absolutely love this blow drying/straightening brush. I was looking at videos on FB of a very expensive brand and someone wrote in the comments Revlon Brush works just as well, and will save you $150+.
So...I had to give it a shot. They were absolutely right! This is so easy to use.
I’m a mom of 4, and I’m a defense attorney...so, needless to say—I stay busy.
It’s nice to have a product you can use quickly in the morning which does the drying and straightening in one. Shaved at least 15 min off my time in the morning!
I do not think it gets “too hot” as some reviewers commented. I like them to be powerful because I have Irish/Hungarian thick hair—which takes a long time blow drying, so I was skeptical but this works great!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I LOVED this thing when I first got it. I have a ton of naturally wavy, frizzy hair that usually takes at least 30 minutes to dry. Also, I’ve never quite gotten the hang of holding a normal hair dryer with one hand while round brushing with the other. This dryer was super easy to use and gave me a perfectly smooth blowout that required minimal flat ironing, in less than 10 minutes. It was amazing. At first.

I have had the dryer for maybe two months now. It has been used twice a week at most, and only on the low heat setting. This morning I was about halfway through drying my hair when I noticed a strong burning smell. Needless to say I won’t be using it anymore, don’t want to risk it literally bursting into flames in my hands.",1,3,B01LSUQSB0
"I was very skeptical because one of my hair dressers didn't really like them. Well I guess because people will quit coming in for blow outs. I have really thick wavy hair and I completely dried and straightened it all at once fairly quickly. It's a little quirky and to get used to and bulky but it did a great job. No tangling, which I thought would be a problem. I did brush my hair out before using but then it went really well. Very excited. Hot temp, is really hot, but I guess that is why it straightens so well. Can't wait to use again.",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I loooooove my new hairbrush dryer!! I finally threw away my old Revlon hairbrush dryer and replaced it with this model. This tool is pretty big in hairbrush size and I thought it was going to be pretty clunky feeling once I started to use it. That was not the case. I was able to dry my hair in less than five minutes and get it straight to how I like it in less than 10 min (this was on damp hair). I am not good at doing my own hair at all. I'm pretty hair incapable most of the time. This device is pretty easy to use. Pros for me: Easy to use; takes no expert technique; did not have to section my hair; dries hair pretty quickly. Cons for me: the device is almost awkwardly big but not quite, however, I do feel the burn in my arms after a while like I'm weight lifting; the dryer gets really really hot!!; after cleaning my hair out of the brush there have been loss of bristles

Overall, would I recommend this dryer? YES!!",4,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Very misleading and got ripped off! We got a totally different brush from what we purchased picture, name and description is totally different from what we got!! I attached a picture so that everyone can see, I called customer support and they said that’s all they got so I had to keep it!! We’ve done research and found out that not only we got the wrong product but we overpaid for it!",1,2,B01LSUQSB0
"Didn’t work for long, after a couple months of use, suddenly the voltage reduced and the “high” setting was more like the “low”, then shortly after it just died completely. Unhappy with the lifespan of it, obviously, not a good value, but while it worked and once I got the hang of it my hair life was changed and I wore my hair down more often than up in a messy bun. Too bad.",1,7,B01LSUQSB0
"After reading so many reviews and watching many videos about this.. I decided to buy it and im glad I did!! If your looking for no effort- thats impossible you still need to put effort, but its about half the effort of drying with a dryer and brush. MY hair is thin so I won't be using it often maybe once a week so I dont over dry my hair .. easy to get hair dry and bouncy very quickly.. great for moms with no time to do their hair.... definitely a good buy!! Wont go back to normal dryer after this... no point to!",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I was so looking forward to using this. I received, started using and it began smoking (only on for maybe 8 minutes). My whole bathroom smelled like smoke so I turned it off and put it outside. It was SO HOT too. Like, not average hot. After an hour I tried plugging it in and.. nada. Never turned back on. I saw all the fabulous reviews and chopped it up to I got a defect. Instead of buying another off Amazon, I went to Ulta and got one and it works like a charm. I’m obsessed.",1,2,B01LSUQSB0
"I have bought countless items on Amazon and this is the first time I've ever felt strongly enough to write a review.

Let me tell you a story about me and my hair. I have always hated it. I never learned how to do my hair or really care for it, so I have always been incredibly self conscious about the way it looked from day to day. During quarantine, this has gotten even worse between not being able to get my hair cut and having to look at it all day on zoom. So, I bought this product on a whim when I saw it on Prime Day. From the first day I used it, I knew I would never go back. It leaves my thin, frizzy hair shiny, smooth, and voluminous. It dries quickly and evenly (I'm done in 5 minutes or so) and the style lasts most --in not all -- of the day without any product. I feel confident and beautiful in a way I never have before and this thing makes it SO easy.

One thing to be aware of: it is rather large -- both the wand and the barrel are thick -- and that did take a bit of getting used to, but nothing too difficult. Believe me, I cannot recommend this enough!",5,One,B01LSUQSB0

 I have really thick, long, mixed texture hair, and it is unevenly wavy all throughout (tighter waves in the back), and often unmanageable. I normally wash my hair 1-2x/wk, more if I get sweaty, dirty. And rarely, if ever, dry it because that just results in an unattractive poof. I find dryers just in general overheat all of me, and the surrounding area, and sweat me to death in the summer, which is annoying bc I am pregnant and hate the heat!! I didn’t have any issues with this device getting my hair dry, *and* it didn’t overheat me, which is great! It’s because the heat is concentrated to the brush area.

I towel dry, apply heat protectant, and use this to dry my hair. In between washes, I use dry shampoo, and this helps liven it up. I use this on my daughter on the cool setting to help turn her ends out, and she loves it. My son has very thick hair as well, and if he goes to sleep with it the least bit damp, I can re-damp with heat protectant and style it very easily. He is much more cooperative with this vs a straightener. It looks much more naturally “put together” with this dryer vs a straightener or traditional dryer. If I dry his with this drying brush right out of the shower, the style will stay through the next day.

I like this product because I don’t have to use a straightener in addition (though I probably could on the wavier parts) because it does a great job smoothing most of it out.

I was very worried about the volumizing aspect because my hair is already thick, but it hasn’t made my hair worse, and leaves it shiny, with a little “turn” to the ends.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I have relatively thick hair and it always gets frizzy when I use a regular hairdryer (probably user error). This thing is magic. I read some reviews and was skeptical but I love it. I wait til my hair is about 80% dry and then use this, and my hair looks amazing, shiny & no frizz. It works really quickly (assuming your hair is pretty dry already) and it's so simple to use. I'd read reviews saying it was large and still was surprised how large it is, but it makes sense. Normally I'm too lazy to do my hair but this thing makes it so easy I probably will do it every time I was my hair now.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I was pleasantly surprised with this product. I have never been able to blow dry my hair because it gets frizzy and I always let it air dry. I was super curious about these products and so I decided to try it. It kind of reminds me a straightener in the way I have to use it. It requires small pieces otherwise my hair turns into a poof ball still. Overall I was impressed that it does work on my hair. My biggest concern is that it still requires really high heat for my hair, which I feel is very damaging. Someday I would like to get the dyson version, but until I can cough up $500, this will do ok!",4,0,B01LSUQSB0
"So this product is big and bulky. I though it would be smaller and lighter but I gave it a try anyway. It dries your hair faster than a round brush and blow dryer which is great, because using the old method was tiring and sometimes painful (if you were doing it right lol). So just for that simple fact, I will be keeping, but I have to say I was expecting it to give me more volume. It also didn't make my ends look that great. They ended up looking a little frizzy and dry. I got a trim so that fixed that problem, but I was expecting this product to change my life and it really hasn't. I could however, see that if you had short hair, it would meet all your expectations. Simply because it would take no time to dry and getting a lot of volume would be much easier.",3,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I was very skeptical about if this tool would do the job but I thought “Eh what the heck let’s give it a go.” And WOW I am amazed! This gave me the fastest dry and blowout style I’ve ever experienced! Even though my hair is short it’s quite dense and using a blowdryer and a round brush takes likes 30 minutes on a good day. But this took my hair from dripping wet out of the shower to ultrasmooth and dry in 10 minutes. It looks better than my blowout with a dryer. It has great drying power, easy to use and gives your hair a great bounce to it! And surprisingly still works great on short hair.

My only complaint is that the handle is a bit clunky and awkward to get used to at first but considering the price point it’s easy to get over that. And given that’s the temperature can get quite hot I would recommend using a heat protectant so it minimizes any potential heat damage. I’ll be curious to see long-term if there’s any impact to my hair health after using this tool.",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"Y’all, buy it! I have naturally wavy to curly hair that is gigantic when I blow dry it. I typically use a straightener AND a curling iron to get the smooth hair and curls this tools gives in one step. I am one of the population who is not skilled enough to hold a hair dryer and round brush to accomplish that perfect blowout look. This tool nailed it! My hair is smooth and shiny and worked well with my lack of coordination.",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"Holy moly WHERR had this been my whole frizzy haired life?!?! This thing is AMAZING. And that doesn’t even feel strong enough to explain it! It dries my crazy person hair, smooths it, and it has SO MUCH VOLUME! In the past (lots of years) I had to blow dry to get a big fluffy (read ugly) mane, then flat iron it to regain some control. I was left with very flat, damaged, ‘meh’ hair. Or I let it air dry and worried I’d be mistaken for an escaped mental patient at any time. Needless to say, I am in friggin LOVE with this brush. At the ripe old age of 41 I am a new woman with Ahhhmazing hair!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"So sad, this dryer was doing wonders for me until about a month later I noticed when I put my hair into a ponytail at night to sleep, pieces were falling out down to my neck. When I’d go to curl my hair some mornings there were some sections that stopped halfway down my head. this dryer singed my hair off! I’m glad I noticed it when I did because I fear the damage it would have kept doing. I had tears in my eyes over the hair I loss. Will take months to grow back. My boyfriend says he can’t tell any difference, but us ladies know the difference! Shame as this dryer really seemed like a game changer for my blowouts.",2,2,B01LSUQSB0
"I should have bought this ages ago.
It sat in my cart for 6 months because “i already have a blow dryer” and “things like that have never worked on my thick curly/frizzy hair”

Take it from me. it will change your life. I don’t know that I will ever go back to a regular blow dryer.

salon blow out results at home, half the effort, half the time.

with a normal blow dryer it takes me ages to get it dry, and then i need to go with a flat iron or curler to style. this tool does both in half the time and i didn’t believe it was possible until I finally gave it a chance.

It is easy to use, and it works on wet and dry hair with similar end results.",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"DO BELIEVE THE HYPE. My hair is long thick and layered and this worked super fast, was easy and fun! My hair is LONG it touches my bottom. If I can do it anybody can. I usually get a few blowouts a month before special occasions I really don’t think I need to do that anymore- this honestly works and looks just like a blowout. And it’s fast. I let my hair dry naturally for a bit and then worked in 4 sections. I had no expectations for this device and am really happy. Results lasted a week or longer. I’m sure I’ll get better and faster as time goes on too.",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I have thick unruly hair, I have never been able to achieve a presentable blowout. The introduction of hair straighteners on the market was my only salvation. I watched tutorials, read books nothing helped. I decided to give this a try tonight, I chose this brand because it had my favorite color. So on my very first try and for the very first time in my life I was able to achieve a blowout that didn’t require me straightening after. I still plan to run a straightener through it in the AM but I don’t have to. I’ve had professionals not be able to get this good of a result with my hair. It was super easy to move around and I have no coordination at all. I’m just in shock, I love this thing.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"It usually takes forever to dry my hair and then if I use a hair dryer I have to either use a curling iron or a flat iron to make it presentable to go out in public, well not anymore!! I can dry my hair in a fraction of the time and it's smooth enough that I no longer have to use the straightener after, this has cut the time it takes me to get ready down to almost no time at all!",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"This styler/dryer is amazing! I rarely leave reviews but I have to share how awesome this product is! I read all of the reviews, but was a little skeptical when I bought it. But I have to say it blew away my highest expectations! I have lots of fine hair that’s not quite curly, yet not straight. The result is it often just looks frizzy and bushy. It also tends to get staticky in the winter so I was afraid this dryer would really dry it out. But wow- I was amazed and in love with this dryer from the moment I tried it. Now my hair dries perfectly straight, with tons of volume. It’s easy to flip the ends under or out. And, my goodness, how could any hair be so silky soft? And all this in 1/2 the time I used to spend. This product is truly a miracle!!!",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I was nervous to try this....watches YouTube videos before using it. I have extremely thick hair and she’s a lot regularly. Did not notice an increase in hair loss like other people did but I only use it about once a week.

I did burn myself on it the first time I used it. Don’t touch hot metal. Lol.

The first few times I felt like my hair was too frizzy for my liking, but then discovered that I just have to let my hair air dry about 60% before sectioning and drying. Much sleeker as it used less heat to dry it all.

Overall, I am extremely happy with my purchase! I actually fix my hair now. Before it would take me over an hour. With this I can finish it in less than 30 minutes!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Hmmmmm.... this product has its pros and cons. Overall, I find it useful and I've made it part of my regime. It grasps the hair very well and does an excellent job straightening my wavy, frizzy hair. It does get super hot on high though, and the low setting is cooler but it takes a lot longer to use on low. I wish there could be a high setting that wasn't so hot. Also, I find that I still have to run a flat iron over my ends before I'm finished or my hair is still too frizzy. Another key is to get your hair pretty dry before you use it or it will take you a lot more time.",4,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I am an air-dry kind of girl but sometimes I get in a hurry and don't want to look so air-dried out in public. I kept hearing great things about this blow dryer so I decided to check it out. First - it's bigger than I expected. My hair is just past my shoulder blades so that isn't a huge problem but if you have short hair this dryer will not be for you. Second - I had low-ish expectations. I've owned many a ""brush blow dryer"" over the years that I had to wait to use until my hair was almost dry because they dryer had no air power to actually dry wet hair. This thing has tons of power and does a great job. My hair dries quickly and smoothly and is left looking like I just left the salon after a blowout. Highly recommend this blow dryer. I haven't noticed any of the issues others mention in their reviews but I did but the extended warranty just in case.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"When I first purchased this product around Christmas I absolutely loved it. I have thick, course, frizzy highlighted hair that when I blow dry my hair it’s huge and puffy. When I started using this blow dry I feel in love cause it made my hair so smooth and less frizzy. I didn’t have to take an hour straightening it. However, after about 3 or 4 months of using it once or twice a week I started noticing my hair breaking off in spots I’ve never seen before. I’m talking big huge spots that my hair is now only a couple inches long and I have long hair below my shoulders. U can not control the temperature on this dryer. It only has a cool setting and a hot setting that gets really really hot. Then your placing your hair on the metal that is getting so hot you can’t touch it. I would think twice before purchasing. I’m not saying this is happening to everyone but for sure to my hair type.",1,3,B01LSUQSB0
"This product is a must if you have broken/damaged/frizzy hair. I used to air dry my hair and then have to straighten it and it always took so long and be such a pain. With this, it looks like I just came from the salon almost. It takes about the same amount of time as it does to blow dry, however it’s more effective in styling which is a big deal for me. I wash my hair every 4-5 nights to keep my color fresh and usually this has helped keep my hair looking styled for most of that time. Also the cooling setting really helps set in the style. It is loud, keep that in mind.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I love it! And keep checking the price it was $43 last Weds or so. Anyway, I actually had not planned to wash my hair till Sat so I worked out, washed hair, applied a little serum and omg this thing was magic. As I get older, my hair seems thinner but takes forever to dry and is a little frizzy. This did I say, is magic? First off, I just ran the wet brush through for the initial detangling and started using this. It actually takes a few minutes to warm up and after it did, I just brushed my way to smooth, shiny and straight. Then, after today's run, same washed and dried. I think it may have taken 10 minutes total? The only thing I found as a little bit of a detraction is I'm not sure how volumizing it is but it is truly a time saver. With two daughters with long hair and my medium length hair, we needed another hair tool like not at all but this is a keeper. Plus on my non wash days, it will be easy to just style with a curling iron or whatever now that there is no frizz. I don't know why the price fluctuates but keep your eyes out, I got lucky I guess.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I've had this for almost a month now, and definitely think it was worth the money. A few things to note:
-Really think about those dimensions because it is quite large. I was still surprised when I opened the box. That said, I have shoulder-length hair (just above the shoulder) and it works really well.
-The metal can get pretty hot, just be careful how you hold it, and, like with freshly straightened hair, be careful how quickly you touch your hair after running this through it.
-It is a little loud on the high setting, I use ear plugs because my ears are a bit sensitive.
-Clip your hair up into sections/layers for the most efficient process and best result. My hair is still wavy from an American Wave perm I had done over six months ago, but it comes up perfectly straight and styled when I dry it in sections/layers.
-I don't save a ton of time over the standard round brush + hair dryer combination, maybe five minutes, but it is SO MUCH EASIER to use this and my free hand to maneuver my hair.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"LOVE LOVE LOVE. I always want salon styled hair. However, I have so much hair and it’s so thick that using a regular blow dryer and brush was too much hassle. A flat iron gets my hair too straight and doesn’t have the blow out look. This dryer is amazing. It saves so much time (20 mins from damp to styled - with mid length hair) and is so easy to use. For the amount of time I’ve had it, it’s worked well. I’m hoping it lasts a while. Truly been worth the purchase.",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"First!!!- she did NOT suffer. Day before this arrived i detangled her hair (2hrs, took it slow and gentle) the day it arrived i deep conditioned her hair. Gave her a screen and gave her skittles. One skittle per section.

Now, it did take a while, first time so its fine also shes a little. But loook at it! I took my time in each section, used low heat till smooth and the high for the final pass. The edges and roots are not sleek because I was not going to do that to her.

Ok, it did not stay super smooth, it got real frizzy an hour later. Didn't use a product to prevent that (don't have it) but it was so easy to braid her hair.

Mom shammers-
We love our daughters hair. She is biracial so it is hard for me to do her hair naturally. I have a skin condition in my hands and get irritated to the point where my flesh peels when i use all sorts of new products. Also this makes it so that she doesn't suffer when combing her hair which is the main reason i bought it Honestly she did not cry from me using this thing.

I'll be using this with my other daughter, if my thoughts change I'll update this post.",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"It would be nice to be able to like this more, but it has significant drawbacks. It dries fairly well, and does smooth hair. However, it is surprisingly heavy which is problematic for a dryer/styler. Working overhead and in the back is difficult with the weight. The hot setting is very hot, too much so to be usable. Warm is ok. It is extremely loud on all settings but warm, and even that is loud. Improvements are needed to make it worthwhile.",3,One,B01LSUQSB0
"For the first time in my life, I've experienced smooth, sleek, shiny hair without having been to the stylist! You know that look that the stylist does that we as normal humans can never replicate? That's what this hairdryer brush does for me. I have shoulder length hair and do a thorough towel dry and then an upside down blow dry with my other big dryer to get my hair to damp. Then I use the Revlon One-Step dryer to sections of my hair (I clip up my hair and take sections to dry). I love this and highly recommend it. This dryer has reduced my ""get ready' time by 80% as compared to my prior method.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I was so skeptical of this product and didn't order it for years because I assumed it was a gimmick. Well, I regret my skepticism. It really is amazing. It gives me a better blowout than my hairdresser and in 12 minutes at that! I have fairly thick, wavy but kind of curly, very frizzy hair; and, after using this, my hair is smooth and shiny! It stays that way too!

I wait until my hair is 80% dry, and, then, section my hair in 4 and use this. The key is to make sure you run it like you would a round brush on the underside of your hair. Then, spin it like you would a round brush after the hair has had some heat drying. That's a poor description, but if you Google and watch any of the instructional videos that's what I'm describing.

My only negative is that I brought this to Mexico, and my hair wasn't quite as smooth. I think it's because I used it when my hair was wetter, and the bathroom was still humid.

10/10 recommend.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I have super thick curly hair. With a normal hair dryer I can take over an hour just to dry it completely, and even then, there are still parts that I can’t get totally dry. This thing has changed my hair routine. Not only does it allow me to dry my hair in less time, but it also allows me to dry it smoother and straighter so if I am in a hurry or not feeling like doing my hair that second, it allows me to throw it up into a pony tail and still look fine. Makes straightening much quicker too which is awesome because fighting wavy hair at the back of my head to straighten is near impossible. This fixes that big time. I’m so sad it took me this long to discover this tool, I wish I would have had it years ago!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Oh. My. Gosh. Let me start off by saying I HATE doing my hair. It's long, straight and really fine so I just let it air dry and call it a day but that leaves it flat, frizzy and a little wavy in the back. Well I got this puppy in the mail today so immediately jumped in the shower so I could use my new drying brush and HOLY SH*T this thing is literally magic! It dried it so silky smooth and gave me so much volume. I used it on the low setting first then high and was blown away. I need to watch youtube on how to get it to come out more curly but I am in love! I will forever be drying my hair this way I feel like a damn hair model lol. So basically...just buy the thing. You wont regret it!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"My normal hair routine is leave in conditioner, brush lightly and leave down until dry. Because if I pull it up, it will still be damp 12-16 hours later.

I shower before bed many nights, thanks to my work schedule. The first time I used this my hair was damp the next morning. Fifteen minutes on low heat and my thick waist length hair was dry. Had volume that the weight normally doesn't allow for as it dried and was less frizzy.

I look forward to using this more often and loved the look even though I halfheartedly used it in a rush.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Makes a blow out at home easier- Less heat and tools on your hair. It Could be better. I have naturally wavy/curly frizzy hair and it did a nice job straightening it out. It dries damp hair quickly. It does NOT get it silky smooth and completely frizz free but it’s good enough. It didn’t really add any volume even though I was lifting at the root. And trying to add volume. It does pull at you hair and pull out hair a little bit because of the boar-like bristles. Beware it still gets really hot on high so still use a thermal protectorant and you can burn your fingers and scalp. The biggest negative I have is that the handle is too wide. I have large hands and it was still cumbersome to hold it at the narrowest part.
I would recommend it but you still may need to touch up with a flat iron if you want it silky smooth.",3,2,B01LSUQSB0
"Total dud, TWICE! Bought the first brush, it stopped working after only eleven days. Had it replaced with another, then it became too hot to even hold after a couple months. I’m talking so hot that I’d style half of my hair, then I would need to unplug it, let it cool off for about 20 minutes or more, then plug it back in to finish the other side of my hair! What a total dud. I ended up purchasing a different brand of the same style brush and it’s been working SO much better. I cannot recommend this Revlon brush to anyone. Total waste of time.",1,0,B01LSUQSB0

Unlike most of my family, I have no idea what to do with my own hair so this thing was a godsend! I finally got my hair to blow dry straight and I was done with styling in about 30 minutes after I got out of the shower from washing my hair. Believe me that is an accomplishment. Usually it is an all day or all night affair. If you want something easy to use and you have at least hair to your neck then buy one!",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"This is the absolute best blow dryer on the planet! I am a hair fanatic. If I were ever stranded on a island and could only bring one beauty product it would be this! I blow dry my hair a minimum of 2 times a week. I own 4 other blow dryers and they are all trash in comparison and they’re all more expensive and a waste of money! I have a dyson that I paid $400 for and it’s just collecting dust. A Ferrari, a Elchim, and a Buttercup all high end blow dryers and they are all a waste of money and space.

This has cut my blow dry time in half! I get great results it does take away a little of the body and flattens my hair a little, but I don’t mind. If you’re even thinking about trying this out I highly highly highly recommend it. I have made 10 of my friends buy it too and they all thank me constantly. Do yourself a favor and buy this now!",5,One,B01LSUQSB0

It will normally take me a solid 43 minutes just to blow dry it all. Don't even ask about styling time! I originally purchased this for my thick, wavy haired daughter, but it's become my go-to!! It takes less than 20 minutes to dry and straighten my crazy, thick, wavy hair!! The bristles DO occasionally pull and it hurts like heck, but an additional brush can smooth everything out in the meanwhile. This thing has honestly become a gamechanger and godsend for my hair care!!! Also, ignore my ridiculous photos.

Took me a couple times to get the hang of it.

"Was always a little hesitant to use a big heating brush since I have really thin and fine hair. One of my girlfriends loves it so much so I thought I give it a try. I use the low heat and it works awesome. My hair doesn’t get tangled up and it makes it look more shiny and healthy with lots more volume. Really easy to use. Only on thing I’d change, wished it would be a little lighter and smaller. Def an awesome replacement for a destroying blow dryer.",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"Pros, the high setting is hot and fast. The brush goes through hair easily. Definitely easier than the brush and hair dryer dance. I am horrible at doing my hair, but this works great. Because it gets so hot on high I bought some product to protect my hair. I should use the lower settings which are great, but I’m a busy working mom and am always rushing. It is definitely for at least medium length hair, and it is a little big, but to me still way easier than brush and dryer. The only thing I don’t like about it is the horrible, loud, whiny noise it makes. Pretty sure that temporarily effects my hearing. It’s awful, but not awful enough for me to not use it. Another friend recommended this with equal enthusiasm, and I’m so glad she did.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I liked how powerful it was and how quick it was the dry my hair, plug in turn the dial and use. But I didn't like the temp control was cool, low, high. High was almost too hot, low was taking forever to dry, and cool is for styling.

The size is decent and I like there is a spot at the end that you can hold while drying but if your finger slips the plate will burn you.

Also kind if wish if I want to stop and get another section of hair their was an easy on and off rather than turning the knob everytime. Like a normal dryer that you set to high, medium, low, and then just flip on and off.",4,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I rarely write reviews. But if I can help make just one person think twice about buying this, it’s worth it.

I loved it the first few times I used it. It really does add volume, leave the hair sleek and shiny and straight. BUT this thing gets SOOOOO HOT that it BURNED MY HAIR OFF MID SHAFT (I use heat protection spray, too). I didn’t notice it the first couple of times I used it. But then I started to notice my hair wasn’t laying quite right on one side. I didn’t think much of it, but then I literally saw it happen. A chunk came off, so I looked and had spots of missing hair all over.

The sad part is I saw reviews that said this happens and I ignored them. I wish I hadn’t. The metal just gets too hot for wet hair.",1,One,B01LSUQSB0
"After trying a few other products from other companies and returning them I came across this hair dryer. I knew when I first plugged it in that it was already better made than the other ones that I had tried. The design of the brush head makes it very easy to get very close to your head without burning your scalp. It has a small finger tip handle on one end that make it easier to roll your hair. It has 3 settings for temp and speed. The first is high speed and cool air, the second is low speed with heat, and the last setting is high speed with heat. The force of the air on high speed is as strong if not stronger than my regular hair dryer. It has made my morning getting ready easier and a lot faster because of how efficient this hair dryer is. I strongly recommend this hair dryer.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"This brush works the best in terms of quick drying. However, after inly 3 months of use, it became very hot and started to smoke so I replaced it with a competitor‘s brand. I also like the stiffer brissles. If it had not over heated. I would still be using it but no need to catch my hair in fire. I was hoping better for a Revlon product.",2,7,B01LSUQSB0
"I am NOT a review writer. In fact, this is my first review for any product. I am the one that reads everyone else's review and then make my decision. As per, I read so many reviews and watched so many YouTube videos about this Revlon One Step Hair Dryer and Volumizer. I have, I'd say average hair. But I hate my hair. I've always had waves and new growth/baby hair and it frizzes A LOT! It dries wavy if I leave it alone. My hair holds a curl AND falls nicely straight if I flat iron it. Most of the time I just use the old fashioned roller brush and hair dryer. Which leaves me with sore arms and shoulders and half my makeup needing a touch up from sweating it off after I'm done. Then this thing pops up in my feed on the book of faces and pinterest. The more I read about it, the more I wanted one. It arrived today. Of course, being quarantined what else is there to do than play with my hair? Used it for the first time today with my usual hair products that work for me. I am absolutely blown away at how my hair turned out. It's soft, straight, smooth and the perfect turn under at the ends. After I did my hair, I hopped in my Jeep, took the freedom panels off and rolled the windows down for a brilliant drive. Normally I'd wear a hat and pull me hair back. Today my wisps flew. Got home a little while ago and ran my fingers through my hair. Minus a couple of tangles, my hair was still salon smooth, salon silky and salon straight after running around semi-topless for a couple of hours. I had my doubts because nothing seems to make my hair do the right thing. Now, I'm in love with my hair again. This one step blow dryer is a life changer for me and I am now forever in love with my hair. I can't wait to style it again.

I will say, the high setting is hotter than the fire of 1,000 sun's. The low setting worked perfectly. If you have sensitive skin, take this to mind. Good luck ladies and enjoy!!",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"Oh. My. Goodness. I am in love with this product! My daughters (age 12 & 8) are in love with this product. I’m not sure how we ever got along without it. We all have long, stick- straight, thick hair. BUT, it isn’t soft or fine. It’s coarse. I’ve never had wash & go hair, or even wash & dry & go hair, so this is life-changing! I always had to curl or straighten. My hair has enough texture to loosely hold curl, but would only be soft & smooth with a straightener. Now I have put both away. I first use a heat protector on all of us (Redken 25 Benefits that I love), then use this to dry. I can achieve a flip under at the ends (not a full curl) & a bit of lift at the root for volume (I use gel & a volumizer on my own). The end result is that all of our hair has never looked better! It’s manageable, smooth & silky! And I am thrilled to finally have wash & dry & go hair... what a time saver from the hot rollers or hair straightener! Revlon One-Step for the win!",5,2,B01LSUQSB0
"I have VERY long (down to the buttcrack lol) AND super thick hair... It still takes me a long time to dry my hair with this, but it cuts the time it takes in half or more... I spend about 30ish minutes blow-drying my hair with this but this is a serious improvement for me because that time is easily doubled or MORE if I were to do it any other way. I normally wouldn't blow dry my hair BECAUSE it just takes too long and my arms just do NOT have the strength to deal with it... This has been a godsend! I just wish it blew a little harder. I feel like it doesn't blow as hard as a regular blow dryer on the highest setting, but honestly, that still doesn't deter me from using it. I would buy this again in a heartbeat if I needed to.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"UPDATE ON THE BOTTOM!!!

FIRST POST:
First, I love this product! It is everything it says it is! I have thick, curly hair, long, and lots of hair! My hair is dried, smooth, shiny, and straight after 15 min of use sometimes 20!

IMPORTANT:
One day before work, I used the product thinking it was going to take 15 min but suddenly a loud NOISE came from it sounding like it was going to explore. Freaked me out and I turned off immediately. I contacted amazon and they replaced the product. The new one arrived two days later! Incredible! So far I have used the new one only once. I hope the issue won’t happen again. I will come back with updates.

LATEST UPDATE:
I changed my 4 starts to 1 star for this product and here is why BUT first of all I need to give 10000+++ stars to AMAZON! Incredible costumer service. They are refunding my money back (still waiting since everything happened today so the money will take a few days to get to my account). Thanks Amazon for an incredible customer service! Amazing!

The SAME problem happened with me about this product. After a few weeks of usage, this weird loud noise and funky burnt smell came as if the dryer is about to explore. It’s very strange and scary. The first time it happened it was about in the middle of drying my hair. The second time it happened it was in the beginning process when drying my hair. The product is great when it comes to drying your hair but it seems like the lifetime is super short. Less then 3 months and that’s disappointing. I blow dry my hair with this product about once a week and sometimes twice a week. It only lasted less then 3 months. The worse part is that it sounds like it is going to explore it’s a scary noise and it smells burnt. :/

I am wondering if other people are experiencing the same.",1,2,B01LSUQSB0
"I have really thick hair. Like hair that takes forever to dry and layers upon layers of thickness that seems never ending. Even though this hairdrying brush is quite pricey, it was completely worth it. My hair looks so much different and it stays up and bouncy through a whole work shift. I'm pretty sure this hair dryer doesn't work on hair like mine if I didn't use mousse. I'm just so happy that all the layers of my hair can get dried and have a blowout looking effect in just as little as 10 minutes.

I did just as some of the reviews said though and had my hair semi-dry before using. It gives a better effect and a more desired results for me.",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"This thing is amazing. I really suck at hair tools usually, so I normally just blow dry and go. I used this for the first time this morning and I look like I went in to the salon and got a blow out. You just lift a section of hair, put it at the roots, roll it outwards and pull through the end. Then once you do your whole head you just put it on the cold setting to set it. My hair looks better now than it has looked in several years! For perspective, I have fine and style resistant hair. I also used this on my mother who has thick and coarse hair, she looks beautiful. She is going online right now and buying it. I completely recommend this dryer brush!!!!",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"If you have thick hair you NEED THIS! I have always been told I have the thickest hair. Doesn’t matter where or what hairstylist I see, in my 30 years of getting my hair cut, and living in both the states and Canada, I have ALWAYS been told by whoever is doing my hair that I have the most hair they have probably ever seen.
I have always hated doing my own hair because it’s so heavy when wet, and takes at least 30 or so mins to blow dry at my blow dryers hottest temp, and take about 20-30 to flat iron or general style if you know what you’re doing. I saw this advertised and thought I had to try it. Well I was blown (no pun intended) away by how fast it dries my hair/styles my hair! The first time I used it I timed myself and I’m pleased to say that from fresh out of the shower to styled dry it was 15MINS!!!! It gives you that nice professional blow out look, and it’s so easy to use!
The handle is kind of big and the overall product is bigger than I anticipated but not too big to hold comfortably (for me at least)
The only fault I have with this is that the temp control is either really hot or less hot. Cool setting I don’t feel is really that cool. Although I don’t really use the cool setting it’s just something I noted.
Overall such a great product for the money and all thick haired people need this!!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I wanted to wait a while before I wrote a review as I noticed there were a lot of mechanical complaints about this product. I bought it in February 2019. I have absolutely no hair skills and could never coordinate using a brush and blow dryer so I’ve always just blow dried my hair and used a flat iron. This product is AMAZING and actually makes my hair look professionally done every time. It actually volumizes and my hair even seems healthier at this point. In October 2019 it finally started having the issues that everyone complains about... it smelled like it was burning, made a popping sound and stopped blowing air. Super disappointing. I contacted revlon customer service and no questions asked, they’re sending me a brand new one (although he did specify it’s a different color but same product). They did t even ask me to send back the broken one. So 5 stars for the product and 5 stars for customer service. Definitely a must buy but keep in mind it’s likely you’ll eventually have these mechanical issues.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
As a stylist of 21 yrs this works wonders if you have any kinda length past your chin! It will not work with shorter hair. It’s easy to work behind a head and get hair dry as a stylist but it was nice to actually do my own hair with one tool blowing and brushing. Helped get my waves out easily. I didn’t time it but it definitely wasn’t too long (started from mostly dry still damp) good news is my carpel tunnel didn’t flare and make my hands numb like a traditional brush and blow dryer. I was impressed for a home tool.,5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I was looking for one to replace an older brush dryer I dropped and broke. I understand all the positive reviews, but it tends to just straigten hair. From the write up, I was expecting to be able to add soft curls or waves, so I'm disappointed in not being able to do that. I agree with many other reviews that it is loud and heavy, but I dries quickly so you don't have to have it on for very long.",4,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I decided to purchase this product because of the many great things and reviews I’ve heard about it from friends. I must say it is AMAZING! I naturally have wavy, thick and frizzy hair so at first I was iffy about whether or not it would really work on my hair type. But boy was I impressed! So simple and easy to use!! The key is to use it on partially dry hair. Make sure you section off your hair as well to get each piece blown out. It does get pretty hot as with other heat tools so just be aware and careful. But other than that, it definitely cut my hair time in half compared to my usual blowout and using a curling iron or straightener to style. Afterwards, my hair came out smooth, bouncy and frizz free! It really creates the blowout look from a salon! Kudos to Revlon!!!",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
I was super skeptic about buying this as my hair is very thick coarse wavy and frizzy. Only good quality straightners and dryers work on my hair even even those take very long time. But I suck at hair styling and I wanted a product that cut the time in half without making my hair more frizzy. This was perfect for that! I am able to do the job in half the time and I am able to use this more efficiently than the usual hair dryer. I still have fly away hairs on the top but the bottom becomes very smooth. But that jusy might be my hair quality or my poor lazy hair styling skills.,5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I'm going to say that super cliche thing. I barely EVER leave reviews. I cannot believe how AMAZING this thing is!!! My hair takes about 45 minutes from start to finish out of the shower. I have super duper thick wavy hair and I need to go in about 5 or 6 layers to really get a good dry and then start over with the straightener. All of this was done from sopping wet, totally straight, shiny, and soft in just 9 minutes (of course I timed it.) I did 4 heavy layers instead and dang. This product kicks butt. I hesitated buying this because the straightener brushes I had tried were all so awful but not this. After seeing a ton of mom's on Instagram saying this was how they did their hair so quickly and nicely with little babies, I decided to try it. I was so skeptical, I even saved the Amazon box to return it because I was so sure it'd be such a flop. It. Is. Not. Buy it! It will cut down your get ready time.by 50% or more!!!!",5,3,B01LSUQSB0
"Wish I bought this sooner. A bunch of my co-workers said this thing was amazing. But I’ve had a revlon curling iron and it was the absolute worst, so I was very skeptical. Then a few of my hair dresser friends started saying how great it was so I tried it. I regret waiting so long to buy it. I don’t have to flat iron or cur my ends, it works that well. Temperature control isn’t great. It gets extremely hot, so just be careful. I make sure to apply a heat protectant product to my hair prior to using. And it’s best used on damp hair, not soaking wet hair.",4,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I've recently let my hair go gray so learning how to style a different texture hair. I have thick wavy to curly hair and prefer it straightened. Struggled with the blower and round brush and a flat iron and never happy with the results. This round blower brush is a GAME CHANGER!! It was larger than I expected, and thought it would be unmanageable, but after couple uses I found it to be super easy! In the morning when hair is a mess I just do a light spray with a little water bottle and put this dryer to work. Within minutes my hair is smooth and ready to go!",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I have naturally wavy hair, and since I've bought this dryer, I feel like my hair texture has improved since I use less heated stylers on it. I rarely straightened my hair before because it looked flat and lifeless. I dye my hair unnatural colors so it looked extra unhealthy when straightening it. This styler give volume and bounce to my hair. I get lots of compliemnts when I use it. It works quickly even on very wet hair. I did have to change the spray I use as a heat protectant because even on the low setting it was setting off my smoke alarm. I'm over the moon about the results, I recommend it to anyone wanting an easy styler.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"My daughter has shoulder length, wavy, healthy hair - I was able to give her a beautiful blow out in ~30 minutes.

However, I have fluffy Irish curls and I still had to flat iron my hair because this device made it frizzy.

Things to consider:
1. The air blows out at all angles - so if you need downward-only due to damaged cuticles like myself, you'll get frizzies.
2. The ""cool"" mode is not cool at all. It's also not easy to change the heat settings while in motion since it has a turn-dial at the bottom of the handle.

So, overall it is easier and quicker to dry the hair IF your hair is healthy.",4,One,B01LSUQSB0
"This is a game changer! I rarely write reviews, and I buy from amazon practically every day. I got this this afternoon, jumped in the shower to get my hair wet, and couldn’t wait to try it. When I got out, I wrapped my hair in an absorbent towel, and let it dry for about 10 minutes. I have thick, wavy hair so it was still considerably wet when I took the towel off. I sprayed my hair with a heat protectant, and went to work. 15 minutes tops to get it completely dry and looking like I just left the salon. Side note: I am not a girly-girly and usually end up burning my neck or face with my big barreled iron that I usually use. I also tend to end up with a portion of hair on the top that I have no idea what to do with. This dryer/Volumizer/straightener just did an AMAZING job and I am so excited to have this in my bathroom. I would highly, highly recommend this product!!!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"So I bought this a few months ago. Since I've been mostly adhering to social distancing guidelines and not really leaving my house other than for errands, I've mostly just been letting my hair air dry, but in the past month decided to try this out. Totally has exceeded my expectations. It's taken me a few times to use it to really figure out how best to style my hair but i love the way it looks. My hair holds up in the wind and tolerates being put up without any crimping or wrinkles and it lasts for a few days. A few tips: the thicker your hair, obviously the longer it takes to dry, so try for thinner segments (I also feel like this gives my hair better texture and volume). Also, let your hair air dry for 15 or 20 minutes before doing it, I think I've had the best results that way.

100% would buy again, whenever this dies. Totally worth the money, as I usually would blow dry then straighten my hair but this basically is one and done.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
This is amazing. I have this coarse curly hair which takes normally 30 min to dry and then another 30 with a hair straightener. This dryer is a game changer. 15 min my hair is dried and styled. Quick hint : if your hair is think you may want to let it get damp or do a quick 5 min hair dryer on it to get it to a damp state. It will take a long time if sopping wet hair. I love it my hair looks healthy and it gives you a salon level blow out on your own.,5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"Used this once and am already dubbing it one of THE most overrated products. Not only is it obnoxiously loud and had an accompanying high-pitched ringing noise, but if anything it flattened my normally thick, voluminous hair. My hand is also throbbing after gripping onto that giant handle so tightly and the back of my neck has just started to cool down after it got scorched whole drying the under layer of my hair. I’m so disappointed!",2,One,B01LSUQSB0
"Wow, surprisingly good! New favorite hair tool! My hair is thick, somewhat curly and tends to frizz in humidity. I usually spend about 25 minutes drying it straight with a large round brush. About 5 minutes after done, the back just does it's thing and I end up with a section that lays opposite the rest. Picture an inch or so curling one weird way while the rest lays flat - and rarely the same section day to day. Even a flat iron doesn't help with this. I tried this drying brush, with low expectations and I'm thrilled with the results. My hair has laid straight all day, no weird wavy piece. I read all of the reviews and this is what worked for me: Heat spray, followed by drying hair with regular dryer until about 80% dry. Then finished with this dryer/brush. Total time 12 minutes!!!! This will not dry your hair just out of the shower - it's too hot and doesn't work well on very wet hair. So, either air dry or blow dry first until mostly dry (just like the hair salon before they start styling with brush) then finished with this.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
I get it now. This thing really is friggin’ amazing! I have thinner hair but not super super thin. It just gets oily easy and limp easy. This gives me so much volume but it also makes my hair sleek and shiny. I add a little dry shampoo at night and can go another day or 2 without a wash! Great replacement blow out! It was worth every penny! The ONLY thing I will add is that there is a slight learning curve on how to use it. I highly suggest just watching a quick YouTube video on how to use it and then you’ll be set. I no longer have to use a straightener on my hair. I’m saving myself so much heat damage! BUY THIS NOW!,5,0,B01LSUQSB0
I really want to like this product but I didn’t find it to be as useful as I had hope. Issue #1 The product is heavier than I anticipated. Issue #2 the bristles kept falling off. Consistently I found 15+ bristles all over my counter with each use. Issue #3 It didn’t save as much time compare to using a blow dryer. Issue #4 The “cool tip” isn’t that cool. You can still get burn as if you touch a hot curling iron. I read many reviews comparing Revlon vs the imitation ones and consensus is that the imitation ones don’t have the the cool tip and it can get really hot (gloves recommended by other users). This is one of the reasons I opted to purchase the Revlon so it is disappointing. I still have to be careful to not accidentally touch the “cool tip” while using. Issue #5 My hair is just as frizzy vs using a blow dryer.,2,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I’m shocked by how well this worked for me! I never use heat styling tools, especially blow dryers, because my hair becomes an unruly, frizzy, poofy, triangle-shaped mess, but when I used this my hair was sleek and smooth in under 5 minutes. Keep in mind though, if you have thick, curly hair like mine, this isn’t going to straighten your hair; that isn’t its purpose. It’s a little heavy due to its large size, but I’ll accept the arm work-out for easy hair styling that I was unable to achieve before. I included a photo to show the size compared to a regular hairbrush.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0

 So we bought this dryer after saw this online review with great voices.
My girlfriend has been using this for almost 2 months and about 2 weeks ago, we both noticed very high pitch noise coming from its base(bearing or fan got loosen ?!) and it is very uncomfortable noise....we tried to take off the base but since there is no filter to replace, we could not just fake off the base.

It is usable yet but whenever she uses, I can hear the very unpleasant high pitch noise anywhere in the house.

"I saw Tiffany from ""Juggling the Jenkins"" using this and loved her reaction, so I wanted to check it out. I have rather fine, thin almost-shoulder length hair and this dryer-brush works really well in my hair after a shower. It doesn't necessarily add much body or volume, but it does smooth and soften my hair nicely. The hot function is HOT! I use the low temp and always put a thermal cream in my hair because heat can be damaging. I have some residual shoulder injury pain and sometimes need a break while doing my hair, so if you suffer from shoulder pain, just be aware that while it is MUCH easier to manage than an individual brush and dryer, it will still take some time to do your hair.

Yes my hair was dry already but I wet the other half while I was already using it to see how fast it would be to dry and I gotta day that it should’ve probably could of taken me about 10 mins total in doing it if it was all wet. Oh and also I’ve never used anything like this before in my life! I love how easy it is to use. I’ve always wanted to blow dry my hair with a hair dryer and round brush, but I never could get myself to learn. So happy that I made this purchase.

This is a game-changer! I now *ABHOR* doing anything with my hair—it’s thick and takes forever to dry plus I wear an OR hat over it every day so motivation to make it cute is ZERO lol. I wanted to give this a try because of some positive YouTube reviews and I’m so glad I did. I’m normally a GHD and Rusk girl but this Revlon styler cut my dry time in half (if not more) and my hair came out so soft and smooth (the styling product I use is Olaplex No 6) without the need to flatiron and/or use of additional products. The value is incredible for the results you’ll get. Love this. Merry Xmas to me!,5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Revlon One-Step started out as a five-star product. It tames my hair much faster than a round brush and hair dryer. However, from the start, it had a few issues. The divot at the top gets too hot to touch, which makes it harder to use than it should be. The One-Step put out hotter air on one side than the other and a few bristles fell out after a couple of uses. Still, not big issues, until they were. The side with the hotter air started melting the bristles. The bristles on that side are all mashed down now, and it is impossible for them to hold hair as they should. After it heats up, there is no touching the top of the One-Step to style your hair, so it takes longer to dry your hair. The bristles fall out regularly (see pictures), including the plastic pink-tipped bristles . Although it started out great, after only 7 or so months of use, it no longer works as it did. I love the idea of the One-Step, but I will be buying a different brand next time. A $50 hair dryer will last years. A flat iron will last years. The Revlon One-Step lasted about 7 months and not worth the $50 IMHO. Find a different brand that holds up better than this one.",2,One,B01LSUQSB0
"Let me first say I never write a review, I bought this under the recommendation of a friend and used it for the first time today.

I work in an elementary school and I posted about it this morning and by the end of the day I had 50 comments on facebook and probably half of those comments ordered the product after seeing my hair today. I have thick, course, wavy, curly hair that’s unmanageable and very difficult to take a blow dryer and a brush to. I often sit in the bathroom for over an hour just to get my hair looking decent! Most brushes also get caught in my hair which makes it extremely frustrating trying to dry it. This not only smoothed and dried my hair but not once did it get caught or tangled! I cannot believe that this product for the price that it is made my hair look like I just spent a $200 salon visit! If you are even considering this item, buy it and try it you will fall in love.",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I have thick hair that's medium length. It takes me a good 20-30 minutes to dry my hair normally. Drying my hair with this tool takes even longer. It does leave my hair very smooth, but you have to put a very thin layer of hair on the brush or else just the bottom section will dry and the top will remain wet. I think this tool would be much better as a reviver for already dried and styled hair. If you don't wash your hair daily, this would be a good tool to use to make your hair look fresh again. Otherwise, if you want something quick, stick to the regular hair dryer and round brush.",3,One,B01LSUQSB0
"First one i received worked twice then just stopped for some reason. Amazon was quick to replace, however I hope this isn't an indication of how long the second may last. I have a few layers and this works well in my hair to help give it a blow out look. I've never been able to style my own hair like that so I like that I can blow dry and give some volume to my hair at the same time. Only down side for me is it can get quite heavy after awhile. I have to stop frequently to let my arms rest since my hair is a little thicker it takes a bit longer to get the end result. Other than that its a nice option to choose when I don't want to flat iron or curl my hair.",4,One,B01LSUQSB0

Full disclosure, I probably could have learned to do it faster but I did it so rarely that I never did. Who has time for that with two little ones at home? Not this mama, that's for sure! Now, after I shower I let air dry for about 20/30 minutes, then I can honestly do my entire head of hair in 15 minutes. 15 MINUTES and it lasts up to 4 days (with lots of help from dry shampoo, of course). It's easy, fast, and looks great. I'm in my 30's and finally feel like I finally look put together most of the time. Buy this.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"If you want to be able to do a blow out on yourself, but cant handle a round brush and a hairdryer at the same time (like me), this product is for you. It is awesome. I love it. I have never been able to blow out my hair all pretty until I bought this. This tool makes it easy. It's not the most powerful blowdryer ever, but it does the job and for the price it is incredible. Highly recommend.",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
I'd been eyeing this for months and finally decided to bite the bullet and get it. Especially since it was on sale. And let me tell you - it doesn't disappoint! Works great on my fine frizzy hair making it full of body and smooth. It doesn't take forever either. Which is good because your arm can get a little tired. I pretty much use the low heat setting which seems hot enough. My only complaint is that the cool setting sounds like a jet engine taking off next to me ear. But my hair looks great and that makes me a happy camper!,5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I have a shoulder length bob and just used this for the first time. I am absolutely astonished and not at all exaggerating when I say my life is forever changed. I started from towel dry, used a blow dry lotion and some volumizing mouse on my roots, set the dryer on low (high was burning ears and neck) and my hair was done in 20 min, which includes 5 minutes of flat ironing my bangs and the hair around my face (I'm mostly grey around my face and they need extra smoothing power). I traditionally would round brush my hair and then flat iron and it would take me at least 25 min to finish along with some serious annoyance because round brushing the back of a short cut is difficult and awkward. This not only took less time but was WAY easier AND my hair looks much smoother and uniform. This is so worth the money!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I finally caved and bought this after watching tons of people rave about it online.
I planned on hating it but holy cow...this dryer is legit.
I have naturally (ugly) curly hair and went to bed with it wet and in a scrunchy last night. Got up and dampened it slightly and used the dryer and I am AMAZED. And I am REALLY bad with hair styling tools. This is clearly idiot proof because I was able to use it. I cant speak to longevity but if it breaks after 1 month I will buy another because it is that good.
I rarely waste time writing review on here, but this dryer earned it after giving me sleek hair with volume in minutes. Buy this.",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"My only complaint and it is so little is the control for temperature and height low is a little awkward to switch between and I feel like it doesn’t get as cool as I want. Now for the greatness of this tool! It has cut my drying time to 1/4th of what it was. I have wavy, frizzy hair and it’s long. So to section by section dry it out and give it volume takes forever and forget if I want to add some curls because I don’t have time for that. Now I do! If you have super short hair this wouldn’t work because the barrel is to big. Speeds up the morning routine and makes my hair soft, shiny, and frizz free!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
I have always blow dried my hair in the conventional way and thought that was it until I try this one. I can style my hair with it without worrying the curls will be back by the end of the day. It also makes your hair super shiny and soft. I do not use it to dry my hair itself cause for me that would take more than 5 minutes and I'm lazy. So I wash my hair and let it dry naturally to then style it with this gem. It's a must have!,5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I bought this after seeing my friends post how much they loved it and agree that this is great!!! It is so quick to dry and leaves my hair straight and full of body. I no longer need to dry and then straighten my hair with another tool. What I love is that is is easy to use and doesn't leave me hot. After a shower, using a regular blow dryer and round brush, I would get so hot and sweaty, I would then feel like I needed another shower lol. Because the heat stays close to the brush and it dries so quickly, I no longer have that problem. I highly recommend this.",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I was pretty hesitant to purchase this but did so after reading the reviews. I have never been able to flat iron my hair without it being too “flat “this gave me a beautiful blow out, I’m excited to use it again and again! I have a lot of hair but each strand is fine. Half is straight and half is frizzy, I have to apply some sort of heat to it daily, typically a curling iron. I get tired of curls constantly this was a really nice switch, I definitely recommend. It is also very easy to use. I was hesitant when I pulled it out of the box as it is huge but not hard to use at all.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"This hot air brush is awesome!

Yes, this brush will reduce overall time spent doing your hair.

Yes, this brush will give you AMAZING salon level blowouts.

Yes, you will probably put all of your other hair styling products at the bottom of some overflow drawer.

However, it is not the best brush for lazy people or those who want to cut corners. To get the best results and save yourself from endlesslessly brushing through wet/damp hair, you really have to section your hair into manageable segments (for me that was 2-3 inches across, .5-1 inch deep segments). You also have to make certain those segments are completely dry before moving on (or you might get some curl and/or frizz).

Tips:
1. Let your hair dry a bit before using the hot air brush. I let my hair sit in my turby twist while I get other grooming done after the shower. Once it is more damp than wet, I will use the hot air brush. My hair is a lot more manageable at that point, I can use the lower setting (seems a bit gentler on my hair), and it is a much faster process.

2. Section your hair into manageable segments! You will get frustrated otherwise.

3. A good looking blowout comes down to 2 things: lifted roots (for voluminous looking hair) and an effortless flip at the ends. Hold the hot air brush for a bit longer at your roots and turn and lift up. This will pump up your roots a bit. On the last couple strokes through each segment, rotate the brush at the end of your hair for a sleek and subtle flip.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"This will unfortunately be returned. I had been toying with buying this and finally decided to pull the trigger. I waited excitedly for this as an attempt to tame the frizzies. I was surprised at how large the brush was. My hair is longer so it is ok. But it is ear-piercing loud. My ear is literally ringing right now. I had to go get a pair of earplugs to continue using it. It shouldn't be that hard, or painful, to use a product. Returning asap.",2,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I was skeptical buying this because all of the tutorial videos of other women using it and it always resulted in perfectly blown-out hair that was relatively straight. I have very long, wavy/curly hair and it's impossible to get it completely straight. When I attempt to my hair is left looking flat and dull. I was disappointed that this tool did not straighten my hair like you see in all of the videos. It was slightly straighter than when I use a hair dryer and a brush. BUT, it did save me time! The size of the brush allows me to dry a lot of hair at a time instead of having to separate it into 5 or 6 layers. On days that I want to wear it in a ponytail I can use this and not even need to straighten it. It also leaves me a lot more volume and doesn't damage my hair. The best part is the price!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
I absolutely love Revlon products but this is not one of my favorites! It dries your hair but your arms do get tired fast and leaves hair just as frizzy as if you were just blow drying your hair with a regular hair dryer. I use heat shield products and anti frizz serum in my hair and using this just didn’t make much of a difference. I get better results just using a hair straightener and it looks less damaged. Also when trying to curl the front of my hair back and away from my face it tends to grab ahold of the hair behind it as well that just makes it a big ol tangled mess. I don’t know if this is only for short hair but I have no use for a product that doesn’t do what it says.,2,0,B01LSUQSB0
"So this is the new hot thing, so naturally I had to try it! Uhh, what in the world?? Are all these 5-star reviews fake? I can't wrap my head around this! First of all, this thing makes an unbearable sound. As soon as I turned it on I knew it was going to be a no from me, dawg. But I decided to try it anyway. Not only is it no easier to use than a regular blow dryer and brush, it is literally incapable of drying your roots! I ended up having to go back over my roots with a real blow dryer!",1,One,B01LSUQSB0
"It took me a couple of times to get used to this and I do have to constantly go back from the high setting to the cool setting because it does tend to get overheated on the high setting, and I feel like it is either going to burn my hair, or end up causing my hair to break. However it dries it extremely fast, and does an excellent job at adding shine, volume, and It straightens my hair all with just using the dryer. I wish that it had a high and low setting in a cool warm and hot setting so you didn’t have to keep turning it back-and-forth, and then it would be perfect!",4,2,B01LSUQSB0
"Being a professional hairstylist and spending HUNDREDS of dollars on tools, I was very skeptical about buying this. I also have naturally curly/wavy thick hair and I have always needed to block out part of my day just to do my hair. But this thing is a game changer!! Warning: although it is lightweight, the tension you get with the bristles will still give you a good arm workout but it is necessary for smoothing! I was shocked at how smooth I was able to get it with no other flat irons/ curling irons or other blow-dryers; it was a one step process. Don't bother wasting your money on a super high end expensive one because this is amazing. It is a good idea to purchase a heat protectant with this and when you use it do not ever stop moving. If you stay in one place for more than a few seconds you can definitely cause some breakage! But I would give this product 10 stars if I could",5,3,B01LSUQSB0
"I love this. I hate doing anything with my hair because it’s stick straight, and very eager to stay where it wants when it wants. This with a basic heat protectant just to be sure made my hair silky smooth, with a little extra volume ( to be fair I’ve only used it a handful of times, so I’m still getting the hang of all the tricks. ) but hands down the best 40 dollars on a hair tool I’ve ever spent and I have pretty thick, straight healthy hair. I only wish I could find the shorter~smaller version of this for shorter hair like advertised.",4,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I had been recommended this drying apparatus a few times but was dragging my feet as I have very thick and decently curly hair. I hate drying my hair but this was a game-changer! I've only used it once so my technique isn't the best but this was amazing! It dried and styled my hair so quickly, probably 10 minutes from start to finish. My hair was so soft and not frizzy and I'm never used to having not curly hair when I blow dry. I ran the straightener through a few pieces near my face and was done! My mother was floored when she saw me. It's a little heavier and louder than what I came from (the Dyson, which I hated and didn't think it's worth the money) but so worth it! I'm now excited to dry my hair and will maybe stop going to bed with wet hair! Lol",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Listen, I am the first one to admit that I’m not great at styling my thin, fine and SUPER SHORT HAIR! I love my short hair bc the shorter it is, the more hair I can make it seem I have lol too long means spaghetti hair and no one likes that! Anyway, not only am I not the greatest with styling tools in general but I don’t have patience... my life has completely changed with this magical dryer! I legit feel like I walked out of the salon everyday now! I don’t wash my hair often either and my flat nasty hair remains bouncy and keeps volume for multiple days with this gem! I can’t wait to get my mother one, her life is going to be changed too! Lol don’t ignore these reviews; they’re real!! DONT TALK YOURSELF OUT OF IT!",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"This tool is amazing. I have pretty thick, but short hair. I towel dry it and only put some heat Protestant gel in, and no other products. It dries my hair in 15 minutes and styles it great! I used to blow dry my hair then straighten it. This takes half the time. The only flaw of this product is the noise. It is very loud...to the point where when I'm finished using it, it feels like my ears have popped. That lasts a couple seconds. Other than how loud it is, this dryer brush is a game changer! Please rate this review as helpful if you thought it was!",4,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Do not wait any longer, and buy this blow dryer already! It dries and styles my completely wet hair with ease and makes me look like I just came out of the salon. My flat iron always made my hair look flat and too straight. I like that this blow dryer gives my ends a little flip and makes my hair bouncy. It’s also super easy to use!! Throw away all of your round brushes and regular blow dryers, because this tool does it all! I wish I would’ve known about this tool when it first came out. I am in LOVE!! Also, I’m not great with hair and this was super easy to use. So, do not give up if you’re not impressed at first..you might need a little more practice.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Do yourself a favor and buy this now! I have long, thick, coarse, wavy hair so when I usually blow dry/curl my hair, it takes forever. I attend hot yoga every morning and most mornings, I have no time to actually style my hair and usually throw it in a wet bun. I tried it for the first time this morning I had and omg... life changer! It looks like I just left the salon after having my hair blown out. And I am not great and doing my hair but this thing? This thing worked amazing and I’m so happy I bought it. Don’t even question yourself. Buy this now!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
I absolutely LOVE it! I have thick and very wavy hair. I usually put off washing my hair because (I’m lazy) and the time it takes to blow dry then flat iron my hair. After using the Revlon hair dryer brush I am completely amazed. This is the best money I’ve spent in a long time. It did not completely straight all the waves but it’s not noticeable at all. That could be because I did not really take my time to dry my hair. It took me roughly 15 minutes. I could run the flat iron through my hair in 5 minutes compared to 45 minutes to get the rest of it. I love the volume it gives my hair and you can give the ends a little curl if you choose to. Revlon got it right with this one!,5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"This is the most amazing product !!! For years I’ve been struggling to learn to blow dry my hair straight and I’d end up with big bushy coarse hair . I used this and my hair not only dried (on low setting!!!) it straightened it , smoothed it and left it bouncy and fluffy with enough volume to rid of my flat head . It’s amazing !!! I used the Sebastian blue hair protector spray and I am amazed at the result. I have bought those pink dry straight brushes and they ripped my hair and burned my scalp. This tool tho is the best $50 I’ve spent on hair tools . I love it I’m telling all my friends and family about it !!! Look in my before and after pics .",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I have very thick wavy hair. I can never blow out my hair because it's too hard to hold the round brush and hair dryer in the right spots. THIS!! It is everything all in one and the oval shape makes it so easy to use. It gets really hot. It is a little loud on High, but I've found if my hair is already a little dry then I can just use it on LOW. I used a blow dry primer spray to accelerate the drying time and protect my hair. I'm in love! The flat iron always flattens my hair and makes it look dry. This straightens and retains the volume and gives it a soft, non-damaged look.",5,2,B01LSUQSB0
"If I could go back i probably wouldn't buy this product. There isn't something necessarily wrong with it, it's just not what I would've liked nor does it give me the results I was seeking. I though I could use this device to give myself a blow out but it doesn't really work unless I put it on the highest heat setting and I am not comfortable with that much heat on my hair, so it is not practical for daily use. Additionally, I have a lot of trouble getting a slight wave from the barrel even though it is rounded. I guess its good for the price. For reference my hair is very fine but I have a lot of it and it tends to get frizzy.",3,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Update to my review: I liked this a lot. But I use it 3-4 times per month at most (usually just air dry) and after about 12 uses or less, it is cold. No heat. Won’t even get slightly warm. Not Cheap if it only lasts four months. This is junk.

I like this and I’m glad I purchased it. Size is a little big and awkward and that’s the only reason I gave it four stars instead of five. It’s such a small problem (I just need to get used to it I think) that I would Definitely purchase again!",1,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I bought this styler because 2 friends recommended it to me.... OMG! I’m so mad at myself for not buying it sooner. I honestly didn’t believe the hype and saw a couple of reviews of people getting a used one and I was like “Ehhh” but I finally went for it... My hair came out silky smooth and shiny. Literally the only complaint is that the handle is pretty big and my wrist gets sore afterwards but so worth it. I haven’t had these results with a conventional blow dryer before because I suck holding both the brush and dryer at the same time. Really love it!

Update, it’s been 9 months and it stopped working out of the blue. It’s a shame, I used it frequently... I’ll be purchasing another one from another company, paying this amount of money for something that will last for such a limited amount of time isn’t worth it.",1,0,B01LSUQSB0
"It works really well with my thick dry hair. After I wash my hair, I let it air dry for awhile just so not to have heat on it for extended period of time. I also use the low setting on already dried hair on days I don't wash it to smooth it out. It adds lots of shine and bouncy moving hair that went back into place. I have almost shoulder length hair. I think that may be shortest that can work with this dryer. The low setting is deceivingly hot. The hot setting is way too hot. The other negative is the handle is too big and hard to grip for more than several seconds at a time. I had to keep readjusting my hand.",3,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I dont normally leave reviews but revlon deserves this one! When I say I was blown away.. I.Was.Blown.Away! I have thick, course, and long hair which wants to curl but never quite makes it so I end up with frizzy hair. I own a Dyson blow dryer and an expensive roll brush and they never get this much frizz out. I also recently tried the Dyson straightener, although great, not worth the price(thats a while different review). Nothing compares to this tool. My hair is a little below my bra and it took about 25 minutes to complete. I think I can reduce this time with thicker sections but I was cautious at the beginning. I dont understand why more hair dressers are not using this.

Revlon.. you have outdone yourself, you deserve more praise for this tool!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I was unsure how this thing would work, but I'm very happy with it! It is much larger than I expected (like the size of a large hairdryer), though that is actually a good thing as it makes it very easy to use. I love the look of my hair when my hairdresser blows it out with the roundbrush, and this device makes it possible for me to (sort of) get that look at home (I still need some practice). And it takes me about 20 mins total, so a little longer than just blow-drying, but way less time than trying to blow dry and then use my straightener or curling iron. My one complaint is that since the air is blowing out from the brush itself instead of down onto my hair, any short broken hairs end up kind of sticking out. The only fix for this I think would be to use a regular hairdryer, so not the product's fault. But I have a LOT of these little broken hairs and it still isn't really that noticeable compared to how nice and smooth the rest of my hair is. Anyway, definitely recommend!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"For the longest time, blow drying my hair just made it frizzier. I'm sure it's because I never had the patience to learn proper technique. But with this I was able to blow-dry my hair straight in just 10 minutes! And the result was smooth, shiny hair that could have been achieved from a straightener. It does flip at the ends though (either under or up depending on how I used the brush), but that tends to happen with my hair even when I use a straightener.",5,2,B01LSUQSB0
"Although I've only used the product three times, I find it dries my medium length hair fast and smooths out stubborn waves. I have yet to master getting my hair completely straight, like I do with my flat iron, but I feel with a little more practice I might get to the point I'm only be using this device. Minuses- The tip can get a little hot during the drying phase, which makes styling awkward. The cord is a little short for my bathroom plug and it's not recommended to use an extension. Since I was blowing dry my hair, and then flat ironing it, I don't see this tool causing additional damage to my hair but I will update if that happens. I suggest a good heat protector product to use before drying to prevent future damage. All in all, I'm happy with this purchase. It's cut down drying time by quite a bit.",4,0,B01LSUQSB0
"This tool is so good at leaving my frizz-prone hair smooth and full of volume. However, it is causing a lot of hair breakage. I use a keratin anti-breakage shampoo and a heat protection spray before using this to dry my hair and still it causes so much breakage. I've tried using it on the lower setting and tried to roll it gently through my hair. Nothing I do stops the breakage. I'll have to stop using it.",4,One,B01LSUQSB0
"This is an amazing product!! The ONLY reason I didn’t give it 5 stars is that it really did some damage to my hair.

The temperature can be controlled, so it should be preventable. However, it is SOOO effective at speed drying hair on high heat, that I found myself consistently using it on high heat to shorten my getting ready time in the mornings.

The barrel is very large. It made styling my hair really easy. Just be careful of the heat! I literally had to grow my hair out in order to get rid of the damage I’d done.",4,One,B01LSUQSB0
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 I was hesitant to try this but after reading the reviews and watching the YouTube videos I decided...what the heck. I am so glad I did! It is amazing!! My hair is about 5% gray (which I color) with some minor thinning and an uneven wave that gives me lots of body but requires serious taming. See exhibit A. I went from towel dried to out the door in less than 10 minutes, no exaggeration. I didn't use any product and my hair came out straight, shiny and looks like a salon blow out. I took the video at the end of a long, cold, and drizzly weather day and my hair still looks great. One thing I would change is the heat settings. I feel like the high setting is too hot, hence the 4 stars. I wish there was a temperature in between medium and high. Moving forward I will use heat protection. I am super excited that I tried something new and cut my hair styling time in 1/2. All in all a great buy!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0

Where has this item been my whole life? I’m in amazed! I loved it so much I came back to buy a second one while it was on sale! 10 out of 10 recommend! It’s that’s good.

"Product update: I only use this twice a week and the pink tips are melting off the ends of the bristles so getting hard to grasp the hair. Also, end gets super hot so had to buy a glove to protect from the heat. Will have to find another brand.

Love this product! Takes a fraction of the time to dry my hair, like 5 min. Gets down to the roots to straighten out the frizziness that my flat iron couldn’t do. I use both hands to use product but no biggie. It’s better than using a blow dryer and brush then flat iron. Makes my hair soft and bouncy. Can’t say enough good things about this product.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I wasn’t totally sure this would work for my curly hair but it did! Reason for 4 stars is this thing is very loud when it’s on high, sounds like a power tool and wakes my husband up in the morning😬 it also gets very hot on high and you have to be careful where your placing your fingers on the end of it. It’s a lot quicker than blow drying and then straightening though! Use to take me at least 30 min to blow dry then straighten. Took me 12 minutes total with this! I was hoping this wouldn’t be too another hair tool that would just sit under my sink and it definitely won’t be!",4,2,B01LSUQSB0
"I will never use a blow dryer again! I love how straight and smooth my hair comes out with this product. I am a Latina women with curly to wavy hair and this product works well!! I can honestly see it working with all hair types. I’m a picky shopper so I was impressed. I still flat iron my hair after because I’m meticulous about having shine in my hair and it looking perfect. However because of this product what use to take me 2 hours to do my my hair now only takes me 1 hour. My hair is straighter, smoother and last longer straightened. I am able to flip my ends with holding the handles of the brush. I love how light weight it is and that it doesn’t get stuck in your hair. I want to buy this product for every female in my family.

"This blow dryer is all over the internet for a good reason! I seriously take this with me everywhere I go and here is why...

Product Name: Revlon One-Step Hair Dryer & Volumizer Hot Air Brush, Black
Amazon Seller: REVLON
Price: $56.99

PROS:
- The number one thing I like most about this dryer is the brush + blow dryer combination. There is hot air that comes out from all sides of the brush. This allows the hair to start drying as you brush it. It is also much easier to use as you do not need to hold your brush and dryer together.
- I absolutely love how this brush has a 360 hot air system, meaning that there is hot air blowing out of every opening. If you have blow dried your hair before with a blow dryer and a brush, then you know that you can only apply heat/hot air to one side of your hair. This brush allows you to blow dry the front and back of your hair strands at the same time which makes the blow drying process much easier.
- Unlike a hair straightener, this brush does not damage your hair as much and if done correctly, you could achieve almost the same results as a straightener.

CONS:
- This tool is not small. It is a little bulky. However, if you have traveled with a regular size blow dryer, then this brush is almost the same or a smaller size.
- The brush gets VERY hot. While blow drying, you will be tempted to touch the brush for motion control. You might want to use one of those heat protectants gloves while blow drying your hair.
- For anyone thinking that you can just brush your hair with this brush and it will magically give you a full styled head of hair, then this is not for you. This brush requires the same technique as using a regular brush and a blow dryer. You have to wrap your hair around the brush and go over the hair strands multiple times.
- This brush works better on semi wet hair than completely wet.

OVERALL THOUGHTS:
- As if you could not already tell, I LOVE this product and would highly recommend for anyone who styles their hair on a regular basis like me.
- I give this product a 5 out of 5 stars for functionality, practicality and overall results after styling.

"Wow, I wasn't expecting this to work so well! I have medium coarse, wavy (poofy) natural blonde hair that's been damaged from bleach since I tried an ash/platinum blonde a few months ago.

I feel like this dryer smoothed my hair while it was drying it and left it shiny and silky, but not flat. I used to blow dry my hair and then have to flat iron it to get it to smooth out, but it always looked deflated and flat or frizzy and dry.

This wand was pretty easy to use. It's a bit bulky and REALLY noisy, but you don't use it long so I guess that's the trade off. I towel dried my hair, combed it out, and separated it into a few big sections. Then I just ran this wand from underneath slowly and it dried my hair really quickly! My hair is usually super resistant to blow drying and it takes forever to dry. I was worried it wouldn't get the roots dry enough, but that wasn't a problem. It works great!

I'll definitely be using this instead of my hair dryer from now on.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I have only used it once, so I can’t speak to the longevity issues people have had, but in my opinion this is a Godsend. I tore the rotator cuff in my right arm a few months ago and have been unable to style my hair as a result. I can’t reach over my head or behind my head, which makes straightening my long, wavy hair nearly impossible. First time with this tool, I got a salon quality result. I did use my right hand a little, but even with one hand I could have achieved a very nice finish. I only wish I had bought this as soon as I injured myself, I could have saved a lot of money on blowouts and saved myself from frizzy hair while recovering from surgery. Fantastic product.",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"Overall I’m very happy with this product! Pros: it left my hair soft and fluffy but with absolutely no frizz. There was no need to flat iron after drying. I also love the speed/temperature control. Cons: I have relatively short fine hair and it took a LONG time to dry, even clipped into two sections. My arms got tired, so long or thick hair would be a TASK! The high setting was SUPER HOT. I ended up using the Low setting, which took longer but didn’t burn my hands. I also had a hard time drying the hair close to my natural part because the brush is so large, when you roll up the hair is is a good inch away from my part. Very happy overall. Love how soft my hair looks and feels. Maybe need to work out arms a little more....",4,0,B01LSUQSB0
"The drying power is so incredible that it fried my hair to a crisp!!! First, second, maybe even the third time, I thought hey my hair looks pretty good.

After continual use, I noticed my hair was breaking at the crown, and the ends were turning into straw.

I wash my hair every 4 to 5 days. I use coconut oil once or twice a month. This works for me and I am happy with my routine. I also use a heat protective spray. Unfortunately, the spray could not contend with this product.

I may have used this brush a little over 10 times.
Today, I have chopped off 12 inches of hair to renew my locks.

I don't know if I had a defective unit but the cool feature was warm at the least. The low and high seemed to be the same temperature and speed.

When I would use this brush, my head got so hot that I would start sweating... this is not what you want while drying your hair.

Anything that cuts drying time down to nothing, is probably too hot for any type of hair. Also, no where can I find the temperature of this brush.

I would not recommend this brush. I wish you better luck with your hair.",1,One,B01LSUQSB0
"so i broke my wrist (the story is in another recent review) and it made it super hard to do my hair. i blowdry my hair straight (its wavy) and then straighten it a bit, usually. but my blowdryer was heavy, and it was impossible to even hold a hairbrush on my broken side. i tried to figure out how to prop up my blowdryer but it didnt work. then i thought of this. this thing is great. THE TRICK THOUGH, is you have to mostly let your hair air dry first. or blowdry it first till its like 2/3 dry. air drying worked fine for me. even though is dries wavy, this gadget straightens it out in the end. i barely even have to use a straightener at all now and sometimes dont, which im sure my hair appreciates. i use it on high, which BE CAREFUL cause touching your hair will BURN YOU SO BAD. this thing is HOT. also make sure you clean the hair out every few uses or it smells like burning hair.",4,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I bought this dryer because I am the most uncoordinated person!!! I can’t seem to brush my hair and hold the blow dryer at the same time... I know!!! Ridiculous!!!
Now my older son grew out his hair and he likes when I blow dry it (it’s sweet! It’s our time together and he looks forward to that every night! Can’t say I mind!!!)
I absolutely LOVE this dryer brush! Best thing ever!!! Easy to use. There’s a cool setting and 2 hot settings, brushes smooth through the hair, doesn’t tangle your hair... BUT BE CAREFUL!!! The top of the brush gets SUPER HOT and will BURN YOU if you touch it. Other than that... it’s truly a fabulous dryer brush! Great quality. Light, great grip & no coordination needed!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"To start: I have VERY long thick hair that holds water after being washed. Even though I pull my hair up in a clip and let it sorta hair dry for a few hours before blow drying it this item didn't work for getting my all my hair dry.

To explain: It worked great for the front of my head but the back wouldn't dry with this as the hair power wasn't enough. I heard that for some people it took less time with this but for someone like me with long thick hair it took too long and I still had to finish drying the back of my hair and roots with my regular blow dryer. It does give good body and a little bit of a curl effect to the ends of your hair.

If you have thinner hair and hair that doesn't hold water after washing it then this might be great for you. I ended up getting rid of this and upgrading to a T3 Blow Dryer and that takes me about 5-7 mins to do all my hair.",4,0,B01LSUQSB0
"This is a wonderful tool as long as you don’t use it too often and get regular trims. It seems to make people lose hair more than other hair driers. However, after six months mine is completely dead and won’t turn on. Do not recommend this brand.",1,3,B01LSUQSB0
"Very noisy on high setting. I would actually say it might cause permanent hearing damage so consider using ear plugs. Very slow to dry hair as compare to a traditional blow drier; just doesn't move as much air. Can make your arms tired raising your arms up so much to use it. Hey, but it looks cool!",3,3,B01LSUQSB0
"It's not often a product exceeds my expectation, but this one did. I watched a bunch of reviews and was still not sure it was going to work well for my hair, but man was I pleasantly surprised. It heats up fast, covers a large surface area of hair and doesn't get tangled. I get blowout quality in less than 5 mins and don't have to go over it with a straightener. This pic isn't the best because I blow dried it before bed rather than to go out, bit I think you can tell how smooth and shiny it is.",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I have very thin fine hair. I normally use a round brush and blow dryer for my blow out to get some curl, definition and lots of fluff and body. I was excited to try this because it would simplify things. Doesn't work for me. The barrel is an oval instead of round and it's HUGE. If you have thick or curly hair it might be nice for smoothing. It just makes mine flat. I can get 3 times more curl and body with a regular round brush. Just doesn't work for me - disappointed. Wish they made one maybe smaller?",3,One,B01LSUQSB0
"My blow outs take forever with a hair dryer and round brush and my arms are tired and I dread them.
Saw this, saw all the good reviews, worries my wavy hair wouldn’t dry right or straight, still be wavy in spots, etc not the case. I’m sold.
Takes so much less time and my hair is shiny and not over dry or fried. Still takes curl or beach waves from a wand afterward, something I was worried about but turned out to be just fine!
Bottom line- if you’re used to blow drying with a brush in the other hand this is so much better. Just get it.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I was skeptical about this product because it can’t be that easy. BUT it was! I used my Kitch scrunching right after the shower for about 20 minutes and then used the Revlon hair dryer and it took minutes to do my hair! I have medium length thick hair and it did awesome. Not frizzy at all. Love this product!

Follow up: used it twice and it stopped working completely when I went to use it the first time. Got really really hot and started smoking. Pretty scary. Called the number for Revlon/ Helen of Troy and got some amazing help and have a replacement on its way to me. Not sure what caused mine to overheat and just refuse to work but hopefully it was a fluke because this thing is amazing!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"If you have fine or thin hair this product is not for you! I have lots of hair, but it’s quite fine and because of that this dryer brush would dry my hair too fast even on the lowest setting. As I’m working on one section of hair it get so hot that the hair on that side of my head gets try before I have a chance to style it. Also, after a few uses I saw lots of damage to me hair because of it. My hair was breaking off practically.",1,One,B01LSUQSB0
"Cons: HUGE and super awkward to hold
Didn't save time
Damaged hair
Loud
Pros: dryed and straightened / smoothed hair at once
Moderate volume added to hair

Got it over the hype. Not worth it in my opinion. I have medium length fine wavey hair. I was disappointed in the drying power. It seemed to take longer to dry my hair and get the middle of the back of my head actually dry. The top has a tip to hold and use to help you maneuver, however it was tiny and awkward to hold. It got very hot very fast. I wish I could have had the option to take the brush off to use as a rough dry blow dryer and then use the brush to go through my hair.
I'm sticking with my traditional blow dry and round brush method.",3,0,B01LSUQSB0
"If you are challenged by blowing out your own hair, or if you don't have a lot of hair, this might work for you, but for me, a blow dryer and round brush heeds much better results on my thicker shoulder-length hair. I timed it and this takes equally as long to dry as using a regular blow dryer. It's very loud and not as powerful as the better blow dryers out there. Also the blowouts don't last as long: the volume was great the first day, but my roots flopped on the second and third",3,One,B01LSUQSB0
"This hair dryer was great until it broke. Like many others, one day it started making a strange noise, emanated a burning smell, and spewed smoke from the inside. Happens anytime I turn it on now, so it's unusable.

I still haven't called Revlon for the return, because who the heck has the time? Annoyed that I have to go through this process, but I paid a decent amount for it, so I may as well pay a few more bucks for a new one.",1,2,B01LSUQSB0
"I love how this does what it says it will. I have long, very thick hair, plus I have a disability with my hands, they are weak. So drying my hair nicely and somewhat straight hasn't been something I could do for maybe 10 years. I've been going to Great Clips for a wash and blow dry for years, but with Covid, that stopped. My hair frizzes out after washing, like Roseanne Rosanna Dana. This hot air/brush enabled me to dry and straighten my hair perfectly. It wasn't fast, but that's OK. It worked and that's what counts. I LOVE this product.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"My husband saw this and told me he thinks I should try it . Honestly somone with curly wavy hair that sometimes straightens it I have tried so many products and after blowdrying always end up looking like a lion 🦁 I read the amazing reviews and skeptically bought it and OMFG I AM IN LOVE 😍 🥰 what are you still doing reading reviews my hair felt so fricken soft took half the time and its not a frizzy mess.

I want to be Oprah and be like you get one and you get one and you get one because this thing made my hair feel and look Amazing !",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I have natural curly hair and my whole life it’s been a pain to style! From childhood to becoming an adult I would spend 3-6 hours doing my hair! If I wanted to straighten it, say goodbye to your day and night! I even had my hair chemically straightened all through high school but I still suffered with excessive hours of styling! After having my son I went natural and hardly ever used heat on my hair as it just was way to time consuming! I work in the beauty industry and a few years ago this styling brush boomed and all my clients were raving about it but it was sold out everywhere! This past year I recommend it to my best friend, another curly girl, after she did a big chop to help cut down her styling time. After that we bother we’re in utter shock! She blew out her hair is 10 mins and it was silky and straight as if she took hours straightening it! So I finally gave in and bought it for myself! Honestly and truly this brow drying brush is magic! It dried and straighten my hair to perfection in less that 15 minutes on my very first time! Why wasn’t this around 10-15 years ago when I was spending 6 hours every Sunday straightening my hair!?? This is a COMPLETE GAME CHANGER! If your a mama, curly girl, or just someone that needs help cutting down your style time or styling in her general then you need this! Also AMAZON by far has had the best prices on this brush, as I waited and compared prices for far to long! Thank you Revlon for this magical styling brush!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"This is a great product and I’ve never been happier with a styling tool and how amazing my hair looks after using it, however, I just purchased my THIRD ONE in less than a year. After using nearly every day for a few months I notice more and more smoke coming from the bottom, if I don’t turn my bathroom fan on my smoke detectors will start going crazy. When this happens, I know this dryers days are numbered. Eventually the heating element starts acting goofy, like staying hot waaaay after it’s turned off, the sound changes, it loses power and it eventually dies. I’ve cleaned this product every which-way, got every hair and fuzz out of the blower and its life span is still cut short. I understand that daily use can cause wear and tear on a product but my standard revlon blow dryer from 2012 is still going strong so... yeah. Great stying tool, but be prepared to buy more than one.",3,0,B01LSUQSB0
"This works great!! I have been looking for hair dryer brush for months and couldn't make my mind up. Finally, after many talks with friends and hair dressers I bought this, and I LOVE IT. It cut down on frizz, sped up drying time, and doesn't give off the burnt smell that I was worried about. I have very thick coarse hair and dry my hair in layers, so this works great for me. Great purchase.",5,3,B01LSUQSB0
"I've had thin hair my entire life. I've never needed to use a hair dryer much less a dryer and round brush. I recently got hair extensions for when I got married and ended up falling in love with having thick hair. For those of you that have extensions, you know it is a must to dry them or they get frizzy, damaged, and slip. Unfortunately because I've never had a need until now... I never developed skills in using two hands to dry my hair. This hair dryer is a life saver. I went from spending an hour trying to dry my hair to about 20 minutes. My hair is smooth, my extensions and natural hair healthy, and my arms never tired. I've never had it tangle or pull my hair. I genuinely love this product.",5,2,B01LSUQSB0
I bought this for a gift for my sister after she fell in love with mine. She’s loving how quickly and easily drying her hair is now. She used to have to dry her hair and then use a flat iron to take the frizz and style a little more. Now she only needs to use this hairbrush dryer and she’s done in 10-15 minutes with amazing soft hair and beautiful styled curls where she wants them. She keeps telling me to “touch her hair” because of how soft it is. I was a believer already and now I convinced my sister! She’s now started to talk to all her friends about how they need to get one of these. It really is a great product!,5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I have been sceptical about all in one hair appliances... and (not literally) burned by multi use salon tools... but this one is fantastic! I have a lot of fine, thin hair that usually gets frizzy in the PNW; not many products or tools combat my hair issues. After talking with my stylist and wanting the blow out look that seems only a salon can provide, she recommended this one product. I've used it 3 times now and am surprisingly shocked after every use! It's really easy to use, I get very fast results, and look like I just left the salon. I do use Redkin's velvet blow dry gel, but that's it! No frizz, no fly aways, no more need for my round brush! This is a stellar product; it blow drys, adds volume, gives shine and cuts my hair time in half (if not more). I have already recommended it to friends! Totally worth it!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Wow! After reading so many positive reviews I decided to give this a shot. I have long and pretty thick wavy hair and have always been blow drying + straightening it for years. It typically doesn't take me too long, but I am always looking for a way to cut down on the process. After reading so much positive feedback, I decided to try this out and was really impressed! After letting my hair air dry for an hour, I was able to use this and go to really smooth and straight hair in just 20 minutes! I needed to touch it up briefly with a flat iron to fix some of my shorter baby hairs but I'm sure after a few more uses with this I'll get the hang of it.

Really love how my hair went from wet to dry and straight with no poof! Huge time saver and excited about this product! I was also really impressed with how hot it got, something I was skeptical about.",4,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I have a love hate relationship with this thing. This is the 3rd time I've repurchased it the last 2 I returned. This time I repurchased because I changed my hair products and thought it would help...it didn't. I'll make this short and sweet
Cons
-it will most definitely fry your hair so make sure you use a good heat protector
-loud and heavy
-lousy on MY hair when trying to use it on wet hair as intended
PRO
- I have found this absolutely incredible for touching up my dry hair. I will NEVER again use it on my wet hair but perfect for restyling and refreshing. Keeps me from having to reach for my flat iron.",3,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Holy Grail! My hair is coarse and thick, a slight wave too. It’s so hard to style I just usually let it go overnight and wake up with damp hair and then wear it up. This is strong and makes your hair sleek! I’m so impressed!",5,2,B01LSUQSB0
"I love how my hair looks when I leave the salon, but I can never get the look at home no matter how many tutorials I receive. I bought this on a whim seeing that it was volumizing. I see most people who use this have thick hair, but I have thin, limp, barely wavy hair that never holds a style, no matter what I do. I leave my home looking cute and arrive to work with flat, unstyled hair. So I tried this...and I love it. I let my hair air dry about 50-60%, divide into 4 sections, starting and the bottom of my hair and working up. Then I use the low setting and just blow out and back and set it with the cool setting for 1 minute...done in 10-15 minutes and it keeps it's volume!!! If I let my hair dry overnight, then I can blow it from dry on the high setting and be done in 15 minutes!!! Same results!!! Won't leave home without this!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
If I would have reviewed this after one week I would have given it 4 stars for its convenience. After using this for a month I noticed that it seemed to get hotter and hotter over time until one day it completely singed my hair. I actually had to get 2 inches cut off due to the damage to my hair. Not worth the trouble. I did give one star for customer service though as they refunded my purchase no questions asked.,1,3,B01LSUQSB0
"Love lhis brush/dryer combo. Until I saw it on Amazon I really never heard much about it. the price was good so I took a chance based on the reviews and product description. Glad I took a chance. Better than any dryer I've had. I only wish it was slightly lighter and I had more control over the cool/hot temperature (it gets very hot), but I have been able to manage it nicely. My hair is medium length above my shoulders, wavy and pretty thick and this dryer dries quickly and gives me a beautiful smooth look and nice shine. After receiving it I thought it would be too wide and bulky for my hair length but my hair clings nicely to the bristles and easy to handle. I would definitely recommend this brush/dryer combo.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Having frizzy, curly, medium thick/length hair, required me to purchase strong, hot hair dryers and flat irons. It took me so long to dry and straighten my hair. With this dryer, my hair is dried, straightened, and styled in less than 10 minutes. Now I no longer dread walking out into a humid day where my hair use to become big or bad. Don't get me wrong, my hair still gets frizzy, but not as much and not as bad. The dryer is easy to use even though the size is somewhat large. The top of the dryer does not get hot, so I can use both hands to style my hair. The dry time is quick, and I get volume and smoothness and I bit of curl or no curl at all. My hair is shiny. This dryer is a dream come true for hair like mine! I appreciated the video available to view before I purchased the dryer.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I have long, thick hair and quite honestly I used to NEVER blow-dry my hair before this product. It would take WAY too long (upwards of an hour and a half), and my hair was always left knotty and frizzy just being blown around in all random places. I love how this combines the brush and hair dryer into one tool so I don't have to worry about carrying both and always needing them on hand.

This dryer gives me the smoothest, softest looking hair in HALF the time!! I was SHOCKED the first time I used this and can't imagine going back to a traditional hair dryer. It's so easy to use and only requires you to go over the same piece of hair a few times before it's completely dry.",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I've used this thing 4 times so far. It is cumbersome, and awkward but I'm starting to get the hang of it. This morning my hair got stuck in it while I was brushing out the back of my head, that didn't end well. The barrel gets very hot and the top part isn't easy to grip so it was difficult to free the snagged hair. The cool setting is very loud, low is manageable, haven't tried high yet. It also takes longer to dry hair than a regular hair dryer. Not impressed so far, will update if that changes. It",3,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Very rarely do I leave a review. And if I do I sure don’t write anything. There is only one thing you need to know about me and my hair: I am lazy. Doing my hair for work consists of hopping out shower and putting it in a messy bun wet and calling it a day. I love how my hair dresser can blow dry and brush at same time but my arms do not move that way. I was not blessed with the girly girl swag. This thing right here.... miracle. I had FUN blow drying my hair y’all! It made it so smooth. So shiny. So manageable. No styling needed after this. It’s perfect and I love it. 100% recommend. It’s cheaper on here than target or Walmart.

Shoulder blade length wavy/curly hair that is always frizzy. Not today baby!!",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"It works like it should I suppose. Temperature is extremely hot- when I dry close to my head feels like it’s burning my scalp. Have to run it threw the same spots multiple times to dry it (I have thick hair.) takes me 30 minutes to go from damp hair to dry, so my arms get tired halfway through. Wasn’t as easy to use as I was expecting so isn’t something I’m going to regularly use as I’d hoped for. Volume also doesn’t hold any different from when I normally blow dry my hair. It’s not something I would or wouldn’t recommend. It’s just an extra tool to use when I feel like it, bc it takes time & technique to get it right. Overall it works good, but more for people with harder to manage hair.",3,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I'm growing out my thick, layered, shortish hair. The lower layer of hair is almost to my shoulders, but the other layers are about 5 - 6 inches. I didn't know if this dryer would work with my hair because of the large brush and my shortish hair. So I was thrilled when it was perfect for me!

Previously, I'd have a round brush in one hand, hair dryer in the other. Dry one area, put down the brush & turn off the dryer, section off another layer to dry, repeat. It took awhile to dry and style. Now I just use this dryer. My hair dries much faster - big bonus! The brush is great for blending the varying lengths well. It even does a nice job with my bangs. So fast, so easy. I no longer dread washing my hair.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"This is my first ever Amazon review. This styling tool is amazing. I am 54 and for the first time in my entire life, I'm happy with my hair. Every day is now a good hair day. I have very thick hair, medium length with layers, which has begun to show frizz from age and from coloring/highlighting, and it only takes me ten minutes to get a sleek, beautiful, salon-quality blowout with this. I find myself repeatedly going into the bathroom to admire my hair from all angles. For the first time in my life I am washing my hair every other day instead of daily, since I want to minimize the heat damage and also the style lasts into the second day. The dryer does get quite hot, but so far I have only used the low setting to style my hair, then I follow it up with the cool setting for a final brush-through. My husband even commented on how smooth my hair looks, no frizz at all. I feel ten years younger with this hair. Some of these reviews have said that their dryer died after a few uses or a few months, and if that happens I will hold a funeral for this one and order another one immediately. I can't be without this tool ever again, period.",5,2,B01LSUQSB0
"I have long fine hair that almost reaches my waist. Normally I drying with a round brush and dryer in sections. On average it takes 20 -25 mins to style and dry. With this product I did it in 10 mins! It didn't give me the exact look I get from my original way, which is more like a salon blowout, but my hair was shiny and smooth. Looks absolutely amazing. I might add that I did purchase the lange brand brush dryer when it was on sale for $100 and ended up returning it because I felt the results weren't worth the price. This product gave me the exact same results as the lange dryer at a third of the price. So worth it!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0

This thing is a game changer! I have thick, medium/long length hair. I was done with my hair in the same amount of time it took my hubby to bathe our baby. It DOES NOT take long to bathe a baby. I would have snapped a picture but I was in a hurry lol My hair was semi damp & it was smooth, dry, full & styled in about 10 min. Never would I have been able to have done that with other styling tools alone & in that time. This is actually the 2nd one I bought. My friend raved about it, I bought it.

"My biggest gripe with this is the cool setting which does not ""set"" the style that my regular blow dryer would. the cool setting has only slightly less warmth than the low setting. Seems to me the blow dryer turns the heat completely off and does a fantastic job setting the style. It is much larger than I thought it would be (my fault no theirs), and so heavier. I also was hoping for 1 instrument to do my hair-I have shoulder length to slightly above with fringe; I have to use a different tool for my bangs, a pain. Think I am returning it.",3,One,B01LSUQSB0
I am absolutely in love with this hairdryer! I am sure you have read or heard all the hype about it. All of it is true. It does it really good job of drying and styling your hair all at once. I have very fine here but a whole lot of it. Normally it takes forever for my hair to dry and often I will let it hair dry rather than dealing with it.

I have chin length naturally very curly thick hair in an angled bob haircut. The brush is able to grab my hair from the root and twirl it around for a quick bouncy dry. I DON'T EVEN HAVE TO USE THE FLAT IRON ANYMORE! I'M AMAZED! The cool tip at the top allows good movement as you spin you other wrist to work through your hair, and the cool air feature helps at the end of the routine! It's very easy to use!!!",5,2,B01LSUQSB0
"I’ve had this dryer for just over a year now and it just stopped working. I feel a dryer should last longer than a year but during that year I really loved this. It was easy to use and I ditched my traditional hair dryer completely. It left my hair soft and voluminous and in record time. The downside was that it gets very hot. To the point I see steam coming out of my hair like a flat iron. It did worry me how hot it would get (which might be why it stopped working after a year). Aside from that, I loved this hair dryer. I think I will purchase something else to see if I can get better temperature control but loved this little dryer while I had it.",4,0,B01LSUQSB0

It now only takes me 10 mins to blow dry and I have the smoothest, silkiest blow out. I would pay the same price for a professional blow out with the same results. But now I can achieve it after every wash! There is a learning curve, first time took me about 20 mins (drying by layer and less chunks at a time
goes by faster). This product is amazing and life changing!",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"Horrible! I purchased this to replace a conair drying brush after I snapped off the brush attachment. I thought this would be a good replacement, because it’s only a brush as opposed to my old dryer which also had a comb. There are also positive reviews on here from people who made the same switch. They either are not using this as their primary drying tool or have fine hair. I’ve been using this for almost a year and can never completely dry my hair. The hot air only comes out of one section, not the entire barrel. It takes forever and I usually give up halfway through. A traditional blow dryer and a brush works much better!",1,2,B01LSUQSB0
"My hair has a lot of volume and in warm, humid weather it misbehaves gets big and bushy. Not pretty curly just a wavy, fly away bush. This hairdryer absolutely works to control all of that. The result is a smooth and silky finish. Just be careful not to pull too hard when using the brush dryer as (I find) more of my hair comes loose than in the past. Be aware humidity will ultimately win and in a couple of days (I wash my hair approximately every four days) it will lose that smooth look and try its best to return to growing bush. Ample conditioner and good leave-in products are still necessary.",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I bought this a year ago and was excited to use it at first. I only used it about once ever two weeks (let me hair dry naturally a lot of the time). At first I was definitely impressed.

However, in the past few months it gets so hot that I feel like I’m burning my hair. Then to top it off there is a burning type smell and I’m afraid it might really catch on fire. Plus, it’s making an awful buzzing sound.

I guess there’s a reason it’s only $40.

So unfortunately I just threw it away.",2,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I have natural curly, shoulder length hair and this did a pretty good job of drying & smoothing. I still had to us a flat iron on a few spots, but overall, I'd say it was a bit easier on the arms than a dryer & round brush. It's HOT, so I only used the low setting with plenty of heat protection product. My biggest complaint is the switch. You have to use both hands to turn off/on, unlike hair dryers that you can control with your thumb. This, to me, is cumbersome, awkward and eats up time while sectioning the hair. I don't want to set it down while running because I'm sure it would burn out sooner. If I keep it, I may end up using it to refresh dry hair between washings.",4,One,B01LSUQSB0
"Have to use on low setting, which gets pretty hot. I’m scared to try this dryer on high heat! Used on my child’s hair (normal density, normal to high porosity, fine-strand, silky textured 2b - 4a curl & coil pattern). Had great results using the low heat setting on small sections.

I have Type 4 hair that’s normal to low density, high to normal porosity, fine-strand, very soft & bushy textured (combination 4a/3c & 4c coils) easy to relax without heat, using good enough tension on existing two-strand twists or using the banding method. Depending on their size, Bantu knots alone will straighten my strands. In the past too much heat wrecked my curl pattern so I had to cut it off and regrow my hair. Now, I only straighten hair to do length checks and trim ends evenly; using over-the-counter heat protectant and low heat settings to avoid damage and my hair always reverts.

High heat might be safer for people with courser hair (meaning thicker hair strands) that’s strong enough to handle it. If you have fine strands—especially hair that’s normal or lower density (number of strands per square inch)—the low setting works great in small sections. Its easy to use, quite handy, and way more convenient than using my paddle brush and regular hair dryer.

BTW, I decided to give this dryer a try and paid for this product myself (no free trials or discounts) after hearing Naptural85 mention using her Revlon 3-in-1 dryer on YouTube.",4,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Y’all.... my hair is wavy/curly, frizzy, dry, you name it. When I dry it normally with just a blow dryer, it turns into a HUGE lions mane. I rarely use a blow dryer and a round brush because it’s thick and I have about 3 peoples heads of hair so it’s not even worth it. This is after 2 passes through that section and if you have hair like mine, you understand how absolutely amazing and exciting it is to have something this easy to use and get these results! My entire head takes 20-30 minutes depending on how much of a rush I’m in, #momlife, versus about an hour normally! Plus, it makes it smooth enough that i really don’t even need the flat iron after but if I really want to, it only needs 5-10 mins versus about 30-45 regularly🥴 so all in all, about 25-40 minutes versus an hour and a half! WORTH EVERY PENNY😍",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Best thing I purchased in 2020. I had fine, straight hair with random waves and lots of frizz from straightening. I used to have to wash, condition and blow dry plus straighten my hair every other day at least to keep it smooth and manageable. With this I can go up to three days without that whole process of necessary (depending on workout schedule). It has changed my hair for the better. It no longer frizzes from heat damage. I finally have the hair I’ve wanted for so long. And it’s so much easier than a blow dryer in one hand and a round brush in the other.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"How this product wasn’t popular before is beyond me, maybe I’m just late to the game but I take this bad boy everywhere! I have basically taken 4 items out of my styling inventory with this one magic wand! And when I say magic I mean it... my hair needed 10 tools and 5 hair products to just look decent and with this I have the body I tried to achieve from shampoo and hair products, I have the curl and wave of a beach babe and I’m finally able to pay off debt with the jobs I have acquired from my new Revlon commercial hair! MUST HAVE",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"This product is incredibly easy to use and it has replaced my straightener and my hairdryer. The bristles allow for much faster drying time and it leaves your hair looking smooth and sleek. The blue and black color is really fun and bright.
My only concern with the product is that after you use it for a while and the bristles become hot they become Bendy when you placed them down on the counter. It still works but it becomes a little misshapen. Even despite this happening, I still would recommend this brush.",4,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I have seen so many raving about this product. It is easy to use and give yourself a “blowout”-quality style. No worries about your hair getting stuck in it. But if you’re used to a dryer with strong drying power, this isn’t it. I have very thick hair that holds on to water and I finally gave up and used my regular dryer both times I used. However I have used it to freshen up day 2 or 3 hair roots to give some volume before work. And if you have finer hair, definitely go for it!",4,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I have been putting off this purchase for awhile bc i have a perfectly good hair dryer already....but I am so glad I went ahead and purchased this! This product is so amazing! First thing you should know is my hair is thick and frizzy! It has natural waves in it too (not the pretty kind :/) My before pic was my normal day to day hair...let it air dry bc normally with my very expensive hair dryer it takes 20+ mins to dry with a brush. Its hot and exhausting. And then it would need to be straightened... aint nobody got time for that! When I used this product it only took 8 mins to completely dry my hair!! and no straightener needed! WOW! My hair laid perfectly, no frizz and just enough volume to it. The only product I used in my hair was some heat protector spray and diamond oil (from Redken). It was so easy to use too. I gave temp control 3 stars bc you can not control the temp. It has ""high"" ""low"" and ""cool"" settings only. This dryer does have a high temp it seems. So if you have thinner more fragile hair, I could see this not working as good. So if you are on the fence about purchasing....just do it!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Lovvve the volume this gives my hair! My hair is fine and limp, so a hair stylist friend of mine recommended this. I’m so glad she did! It’s making a huge difference in my confidence she gives my hair that boost it needs. It’s also super easy to use and softens my frizzy hair *while* it volumizes. It’s a must-have for fine-haired girls like me.",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"This product is honestly amazing. I am never one to write reviews on products, but am a huge review reader before purchasing (selfish of me, I know). That said, I felt compelled to review this product to hopefully encourage more people to purchase!!

The blow dry brush is absolutely amazing and so easy to use. You get out of the shower, throw your hair in a towel, lotion/do your typical routine and when your hair is damp (not soaking wet) you can get started with the brush. I have super curly and frizzy hair so I didn't think this thing would work for anyone that didn't have p straight and frizz-less hair naturally. I was wrong!! I section my hair into 3s (under, middle, bangs/top of my head) and get to brushing. There is no learning curve, you can run this through your hair just like a typical round brush.

You are left with shiny, voluminous and frizz free hair in about 20 mins (I have shoulder length hair so longer/thicker hair will obv take more time). The best part is it also lasts! I typically wash my hair twice a week and use this brush to dry. The other days of the week I simply run a straightner through anything that has begun to frizz due to weather/activity/etc and then I'm good as new. Seriously this has saved me so much time in the morning and has made my hair look and feel amazing.

My one piece of advice would be to also purchase the travel kit (or protective case) because the bristles can get bent if you aren't storing it correctly. Alternatively, if you have something that can suspend the brush (maybe a ring holder or a cup to sit it in) you should be fine as well. The key is to not lay the brush down on a hard surface just after you finish because the bristles are still hot and will eventually bend/get worn down. Otherwise, this is super easy to use, easy to store and easy to travel with. It cuts my routine in half and I would 10/10 never go back to a traditional blowdryer again.",5,2,B01LSUQSB0
It makes hair frizzy and not as perfect results as it initially posted,1,4,B01LSUQSB0
"First, I will say that this works on my hair, smooths it out nicely. BUT, it gets WAY too hot! It has damaged my hair beyond repair...I just had four inches cut off. It damaged my dressing table, without my knowledge. I have a runner on it, and it burned the surface through it, apparently when placed on it after using....it'll never be the same. Also, it has melted/bent its own bristles. There needs to be a temp control feature on this thing, as I couldn't even touch my hair for several minutes while using this.",1,0,B01LSUQSB0
"This is like a dream tool, so the fact that it only lasted 6 months (bristles melted since I twist it as I go along for tension to straighten my hair while using) and it literally just died this morning... like dead dead... makes me mad and sad. Now what!?? Do I buy another one and just keep polluting the earth by throwing it away every 6 months? This is a major bummer. I don’t even know what else to say.",1,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I am OBSESSED with this! I was very skeptical because I have very long, curly, thick hair that takes forever to blow dry so I truly didn't think this was going to work and my only regret now was not buying it sooner!! It takes half the time it does with my usual blow dryer, my arm never hurts and it looks so much better. Usually I have to touch up with a straightener but not with this. I cannot stress enough how good this works and hardly any frizz compared to my usual!! Very hot! Perfect for people with hair like me",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"This has completely changed my hair game. I was contemplating on getting the Dyson but I found a ton of reviews comparing this product to the Dyson. The reason I went with this hair dryer and styler is because I occasionally like to do anything to my hair. I prefer to air dry my hair after showers but this thing comes in handy for that day when I want a perfect blow dry look like the salon. Whenever I use it, people do notice and they keep complimenting on how amazing my hair looks. I am no expert, all I do is just blow dry my hair with this thing, and walla, I look like I went to the salon. Just to let you guys know, I have wavy hair that’s normal in texture. My sister has thin hair and her hair looks amazing when she uses it too. It provides a lot of volume especially for thin hairs. Always use a heat protective spray before using this product. I use the Oui conditioning spray. The outcome is beautiful!",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
Like most women I cannot say enough good things about this product . Beware of buying products that appear similar on line in most of the videos they show in their ads it's actually the Revlon blow dryer and not their knock off it is this one.. it is so easy to use and leaves my hair so soft and shiny without having to straighten it after blowing Here also doesn't feel as dry or course after using this product like it dies with a regular blow dryer I have hair that is almost to my butt and a is much faster to dry my hair with this verse is a standard blow dryer even sectioning the hair. But like any blow dryer use he protect meant as it does get quite hot not too high but hot,5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"After watching several videos of the ""how tos"" on this drying brush -- it's not as what it seems. You must first blow dry your hair about 75-80% before using this blow dryer brush, which to me, defeats the purpose of a blow dryer brush. After blow drying your hair, you may now use the blow dryer brush, however, to achieve the volume that you normally would with a regular blow drying and round brush, you must go back to the old school way of doing it with both tools. In addition to it being multi step process, the heat that it gives is a little too high and which can add damage to your hair as well. I would not recommend this product.",2,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I am so Happy!!! I am one of these people who use a ton of expensive product to tame my frizz---but now I use nothing- NADA!! I dreaded hair-washing day like the plague, but this dryer is the bomb. My hair looks silky smooth and I no longer use one single product to tame my hair. I wash, and use this dryer and it smooths my hair and I can flip the ends if I want, depends on my mood, but I can also keep it straight. No flat iron needed either. Only warning is it does get hot so be careful about touching where the air comes out. There is a 'cool' option too. I use that to lock in the curl when I flip the ends. I live in a humid area so this will be great for me year round.",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"Instead of blowdrying and THEN styling, THIS will do it all for me in 10 mins. I have thick and wavy shoulder-length hair that usually two people in the salon have to blowdry to save time. Plus, styling has never been easier. It comes out with volume and SO much straighter than I could do with a flat iron. I'm very happy with my purchase!

I've seen some of the reviews that say people are frying their hair with this...so I was hesitant to buy. Well, I didn't realize this is a hairdryer and not a styling iron. So, I'm not sure how they're doing that. I started with the low setting JUST IN CASE, and everyone should always use a heat protector whenever using any kind of heat on your hair.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"This is the first hair dryer/brush I’ve ever used, and after a little bit of practice, I’m able to get a decent result. It’s a very loud dryer though, and I use ear plugs when I use it. Maybe with more practice I’ll be able to do a better job with this brush, but right now I’d say that using a regular round brush is doing a better job of really smoothing out the top layer of my hair. I’m sure this varies with user skill as well as the type of hair you have. I have medium length Caucasian hair, dyed, and with some natural wave to it.",4,0,B01LSUQSB0
This item turned out to be defective. It went bonkers while I was using it. Only the second time I used it. I can’t even describe what happened - it scared the hell out of me. It made this crazy metal on metal clanking noise and started smoking up. I unplugged it right away. And the return window has passed. Very upsetting.,1,One,B01LSUQSB0
I really like this product. As a hairstylist I have been suggesting this to a lot of clients but didn't have a lot of experience with it firsthand. I have short almost shoulder-length hair. I get my hair relaxed two to three times a year. I was pleasantly surprised that it's smooth out my new growth! The brush part is a little bit big for my length of hair but otherwise I think this is a great product. The only thing that I would suggest is allowing your hair to air dry most of the way or use a regular blow dryer to dry your hair most of the way. This is a styling brush.. not a blow dryer necessarily.. so you can't expect them to do the same things without manipulation.,4,0,B01LSUQSB0
"After the first use I was determined to give maximum of 3 stars solely due to its loudness however, I decided to use it a few more times prior to posting a review and I'm glad that I did. The noise level is a bit high however compared to a regular hair dryer it is slightly quieter. Dries hair very quickly in either high or low settings. The high cool air cycle is my favorite feature...absolutely love not having to try to hold down the cool button on my hair dryer during the entire time of putting the finishing touch of setting the blowout and adding shine to the hair (which is what you achieve by giving your hair a cool air shot directly after drying it)",3,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Bought this product after my daughter raved about hers. I don't use it most days, however, because it takes longer than a standard hair dryer, and its pull on the ends of the hair can be enough to have a flattening effect on the hair on the crown of the head. If you have both devices, I would recommend, drying the hair near the roots first, with the hair dryer, and finishing off the ends with this item. It is certainly easier on the hair than a curling iron.

I hope the company will make another version with a smaller diameter brush, since the curl size is too large for my shorter hair, but, obviously, the bulk of the inner parts necessary to make the device work may preclude that.",4,One,B01LSUQSB0
When i first bought this product i honestly was obsessed with how quickly it dried my hair and how easy to use it was. However. I noticed my hair was thinning out a lot and i couldn’t figure out why. Finally someone else on my IG posted about there hair thinning after months of using it. I use well known brand hair products so i know it wasn’t from that. It sucks because this was sooo Convenient. But if you’re someone that doesn’t blow dry often and use every now and than go for it. But for everyday or other day use don’t recommend. Moroccan oil has the best blow dryer by far.,1,2,B01LSUQSB0
"The product may be fine, but my experience was not. My teenager found their Christmas present because it arrived unboxed or wrapped. Just a mailing label on the Revlon box. It was also left in the snow while it was snowing. I have a small indoor porch that would have kept the box from being damaged, instead it is half soaked. It is also an electric device so it could be damaged.",1,4,B01LSUQSB0
"This is a fire hazard waiting to happen! I’ve only used this product maybe 3 times? And today when I was blow drying my hair I noticed a funny smell... the motor must of blown out because it sparked and then my electrical socket started smoking!!!

I immediately turned it off and will be calling an electrician tomorrow.

Please please beware! Not worth your house potentially burning down. Just get the Dyson.

Never had an issue with the socket in all my years of living in my house so all the reviews are right!

I’d like a refund as well!",1,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I have very thick hair - and alot of it. My neighbor looked like she just had a professional blowout done and she told me about this product. Now I HATE blowing out my hair now , I get sweaty, my arms hurt and its sooo time consuming. Well HELLO TO THE MIRACLE OF THIS PRODUCT!!!. It dries your hair quickly, it is so easy to style and make your hair look like you just left the salon. I am in love !! I am thinking I may buy a second to keep as a back up just in case mine breaks or they discontinue it some day. I do believe it is a fairly new tool so no worries there. But I swear this was and is the answer to my hair drying/ styling dreams. Another UNBELIEVABLE thing is the price, $45. I believe and its worth every cent. Folks I can't say enough about this hair drying/styling tool.
If you decide to purchase you will be over the moon.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I read thousands and thousands of reviews before I committed to buying this brush. I couldn’t imagine (or believed) that I’d be able to do a hair salon blowout all by myself. Specially, after YEARS of trying to do so the old fashion way (not to mention paying $50/blow out). Well I’m here to tell you it works! I have been straightening my hair for many moons now so I got that process down. This brush didn’t really cut down the time for me but leaves my hair looking so bouncy and fresh. I’ve done it three different ways and the best way for me is to let my hair air dry until it is about 80% dry. If my hair is too wet, it takes longer and the hair still feels damp at the end. My hair is about midway down my back.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I was able to dry my whole head of long natural hair in about 40 minutes. I didn’t have any heat protectant on my hair, so I started out on high and finished on low. It is a bit hard to change the temperature, specifically if you want to turn it onto low: sometimes you’ll pass that and accidentally go to high. Make sure you are paying attention to the temp settings!

I didn’t have much breakage from it, and even more importantly, I didn’t have any heat damage, especially since I didn’t wear heat protectant.",4,One,B01LSUQSB0
"Good: dries fast, single step to dry & straighten
Bad: the switch is in a stupid location, making it impossible to change from high heat to cool while in process of using. But that’s actually irrelevant since the cool isn’t actually cool shot like other dryers...it simple is less hot at the same high speed.

Great for longer layers. The barrel is too big for shorter hair. I have to use my regular hair dryer on my bangs.",4,3,B01LSUQSB0
"I bought this because so many of the influencers I follow on Instagram absolutely rave about this. I was looking for a new hair dryer and was particularly drawn to this because I always struggle to hold the hairbrush and hair dryer at the same time to blow dry my hair smoothly. When I first got this, I liked it. It did a good job, dried my hair relatively fast. It was a little difficult when drying the top sections of my hair, but nonetheless, it did the job. Very quickly, though, it started making this intense, high-pitched sound when used on the highest setting, which of course, was my preferred setting. It got so unbearable, I couldn't use it. I live in an apartment with other girls and the sound was just too much, especially if I was drying my hair late at night. I never return products, but this one I had to. I've looked through similar reviews and others have had the same problem I had, unfortunately. I'm writing this review to warn others, because if I had known it would end up making such a shrill, awful, Banshee-like noise, I wouldn't have bought it. Basically, lesson learned-- read reviews before you buy whatever the influencers on Instagram are promoting.",1,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I was so excited for this. My friend raved about it, I bought without even trying it. My sister warned me hers sparked once and it broke her hair in certain places (she has long thick hair) but I figured it was just hers and her hair type. So I bought it anyway and loved it. Until I realized my hair had a lot of broken pieces. Again figured it was just chance.. NO! I don’t if it’s because I have fine hair but I now have hair 3 inches shorter than the rest of my hair. It looks like when a little kid gets ahold of their parents scissors and chops chunks of hair... I am so upset and so disappointed in myself for not listening. Do not buy! ESPECIALLY if you have fine hair!",1,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I have very thick hair..to the point it’s still damp in the am, when I wash it the night before.....This device is amazing! I’ve never been one to use a hairdryer, due to it taking forever to dry my hair, so I’d typically just let my hair dry naturally and as aforementioned, it would still be damp in the mornings....

BUT now, I don’t have to worry about that. I found this gem of a device! It still probably takes a little longer to dry than it should, however, I’m not waking up with damp hair any longer.

Device also does not tangle easily. I am very impressed! The main reason I ordered this was due to the rave reviews and not to even mention, the high amount of reviews that this device had.

Great item! Highly recommend!!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I have a young kid at home, which, for many women, means less than no time to get ready. I am one of those women. This is such a lifesaver so I can pretend I'm not a swamp creature every day. I have long hair, that's medium-thick. I get out of the shower, let my hair sit in a towel while I put on my clothes, and then just use this as any other brush...you can use it to give more volume by using it like a real round brush, which I have done twice and it works well for that, but mostly I just brush my hair with it on and end up with sleek, straight hair in 10 minutes. Fabulous. It is loud, but I don't care. It works, it was not terribly expensive, and I feel so much better having my hair ""done"".",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Love this blow dryer! I have very curly hair as you can see in the photos. One is my normal curls, one is what happens when you brush them out, and one is when I used this blow dryer to blow dry it straight. I was surprised how easily the bristles moved through my hair, they didn't pull at all and I didn't even bother brushing it when I got out of the shower. It dried my hair pretty quickly and my hair felt soft after, not fried. The only problem I had, which I think will go away when I've used it a few more times, is drying my roots.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"After reading all the reviews and ordering it, I really wanted to love it. It is a good product however it does not cut down on drying time like I was expecting it to. I have really thick long hair, and have tried it several times varying how long I wait before drying, using my hair dryer spray (helps to dry faster), etc. The only way to cut down on the time was to let my hair air dry longer, which doesn’t really save any time in the long run. I do like how easy it is to use instead of having to hold my hair dryer in one hand and brush in the other. I also like that it does help cut down on frizz. Overall, I do feel it’s a good product, I just think my hair is a bit too much for it to work as well as it does for other people.",4,0,B01LSUQSB0
"A lot of friends kept recommending this. However, I’m not a fan. I have long hair and it took FOREVER to dry. I bought this hoping my morning routine would go quicker but that wasn’t the case. After over 30 minutes I gave up. This may be great for ladies with short hair but I’ll save my sanity and stick with my blow dryer.",2,3,B01LSUQSB0
"I have very long, thick hair. This Revlon One-Step goes through all of my hair and does NOT TANGLE. It dries my hair quickly. Takes out the friz. Bristles are on softer side, don’t hurt. I can dry it straight or slight curl. It works for me much better than I thought it would and performs better than other products I have tried that are like it. It’s not difficult to use either despite its ginormous appearance.",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I have really been wanting to have a brush dryer that worked. I think I must have tried a few over the years (many years ago) and they all just kinda sucked. I happen to see an ad for this one...logged into amazon and saw the reviews and one click purchase it was done. I do not have curly hair but it is long and has some wave to it. This has been an awesome too!! It is so easy beacuse you only have to really be using one hand at a time. It definitely has a straightening aspect to it but I am unsure how it would work on really curly hair...it’s not an iron, just a drier. Love also that the end is not heated so you can grab that part while curling under the ends of the hair. My 2.5 year old daughter even loves to “help me out” by brushing my hair with this (always under supervision and on the cold setting). Also it is very easy to fit in a suitcase for the avid business or leisure traveler like myself. Very happy!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
I read so many reviews raving about this so I bought it. I have pretty wavy hair but it isn’t very thick. I found it took some time to do my whole head and it still wasn’t able to get all the waves close to my head. I prefer my regular blow dryer over this for after the shower. But I do like this after my workouts when I’m basically blow drying out the sweat. Even the cool setting is pretty strong and works well for that. It’s also great for mornings when I don’t wash my hair to give it a little extra body.,4,0,B01LSUQSB0
"First off, this dryer is amazing. So with THAT said, here is my ONLY suggestion for the next model: Those of us with short bobs need a smaller round brush (as it stands now, I have to blow my hair out and then use the flat-iron to ""calm down"" my oversized, 1960's bubble head hair (LOL!!) and because no one wants bubble head, with this existing size brush, that's what you get). I suggest interchangeable brushes -- the existing size brush PLUS a smaller size brush and I would even pay extra for it (as I'm sure others might as well).",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"This is probably one of the best products for the money I have ever used. At first it was a bit difficult but after the first couple of sections I got the hang of it. Works so much better than a roll brush and hair dryer and half the time and hassle. I also usually have to use a straightener as well to get it to my preferred styling. I have 3A/3B type curls and it gave me a great blow out look and made my hair feel like silk. You will need to use a heat protectant due to how hot the high setting gets and be careful around your ears, I almost burnt one of mine for letting the heat sit too long while drying my hair. It is loud, which is the only down side to the product. But I would buy/recommend this to anyone.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I have waist length curly/ frizzy hair that normally takes a while to dry with a regular round brush and dryer. My arms get pretty tired by the end and the results never really seem worth it. This worked great! It was much quicker and my hair came out much smoother than I would normally be able to get it (especially in the back). My arm did get tired a bit, but much less than with a usual dryer. I did try to use my left hand to hold the tip of it to take some of the load off my right arm and that was not a good idea. The tip gets really hot. I ended up using the heat resistant glove that came with my flat iron and that solved the problem. An unexpected bonus was that I didn’t get hot while using this. Usually, by the time I’m done drying my hair I feel like I need another shower cause I’m drenched in sweat. I guess because the hot air blows directly into your hair instead of all over you this was much more pleasant to use. I don’t use a hair dryer in the summer because I can’t stand that hot feeling but I think I will be able to use this no problem. I’ve honestly never been that impressed with any hair tool, much less a Revlon one. I really wanted a Dyson dryer and now I’m not so sure I do anymore.",5,2,B01LSUQSB0
"I am over 60 years old. My hair is shoulder length, thick, very fine and straight. This is easier to use than I thought it would be. It is large but not hard to handle. I have used it four times now and have a handle on how to use it best for my hair. I use to use a hair dryer and flat iron. I get MUCH better results with this. My hair has never looked better. So smooth, no fly aways. And it is so shiny. The smoothness and shine lasts. With a flat iron my hair never looked as good the second day. It really does dry your hair much faster. My hair is thick and holds on to water, I can get my hair dry and styled in half the time now. It is hot and my cheeks get red, but I don’t get over heated and sweaty like I do with a hair dryer. I won’t be going back to a hair dryer again. I highly recommend!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I blow dry my hair daily. I've never had any issues. I bought this product because I thought I could get volume. False.
It looked like I blow dried my hair and straitened it. So it was super flat and no volume. It looked nice though so I continued to use it. Unfortunately, I started to notice my hair felt dry - which I have never had issues with. I realized it was also breaking my hair. I stopped using right away! If you could control the temperature it might have potential.",1,One,B01LSUQSB0
"Pros:
1) Easy to use (I could never get the round brush and hair dryer routine down and this made it extremely easy)
2) Every time I use it I get compliments on how beautiful my hair looks

Cons:
1) The highest heat setting gets extremely hot to the point where it burns your scalp
2) after having this over a year now and using it maybe 4x a month, I’ve noticed the front part of my hair, near my forehead where my hair is the thinnest, becoming super thin and patchy.

ONLY use this dryer on the low setting because after repeated use, it will damage your hair and cause your hair to thin",3,One,B01LSUQSB0
"For reference, I have fine hair, but a lot of it. I have a ton of “halo” frizz and damage from heat and color and let me tell you this made my frizz almost nonexistent. I usually have to drown my hair in oil to tame my frizz (which makes it look oily and flat which I hate) and straighten it and or curl after blow drying but literally did nothing but use this and it looked Amazing. Best hair tool I’ve ever purchased! Would be easy to throw some curls in after as well but it so smooth and straight but with body that it looks like I spent a lot longer on it than I did! Also did take way less time, maybe 10 min for my long hair. I do recommend a heat protector blow out spray (even a cheap one will do) but you can really use any product you’ve had success with and it only makes it look that much better",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I have a large amount of hair and drying it was always a nightmare. I also have some arthritis in my hands and this product has been a relief. Now what took me over an hour to dry,takes half the time. And because I'm not holding two things (round brush and hairdryer) my hands don't suffer. Truly can not recommend it enough.

If I want to take even less time drying my hair, I will wash it at night and put it in a towel turban and then dry it in the morning. takes about 20 minutes. My hair is long,thick and I have a lot of it. I do have to pass the flat iron on my hair to make it super straight even after using this product. Regardless, even with doing that extra step, I still take 20 minutes to do my hair.

I would recommend to use a heat protectant because it does get really hot. Also, I wash my hair twice a week and I always use a hair mask. I have not seen any heat damage so far.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Pros: The results on long wavy hair were amazing. No frizz at all. Looks as close to a professional blow out as you can get for the price (which is great)! Cost friendly..... You really get a lot for the money.

Cons: The handle is a bit large and bulky, making it a bit awkward to maneuver. The brush doesn’t not reach easily reach the roots of you hair so it takes a bit of work to dry and shape the hair near your head. I suspect this gets easier with a bit of practice.

Overall: Amazing product for the price! Would definitely recommend.",4,One,B01LSUQSB0
"Because of the pictures, I was under the impression that this straightened hair as it dried it. But no definitely not. I have thick curly hair and yes it dried it okay, but left it a big, poofy, frizzy mess. So I still need to straighten it. Waist of money for me because normally I blow dry my hair, running a brush through it to straight it, then use my straightener afterwards. When i use my basic blow dryer and brush, my hair comes out less frizzy and more straight. If you just want this to dry and frizz your hair then it’s for you, otherwise, your regular hair dryer will work just as good!",3,0,B01LSUQSB0
Excelent product until it was burn off. It lasted only about 3 weeks,1,10,B01LSUQSB0
"*starry eyed* Where have you been all my life, you hunk?!
Remember weird hair trends like toothy headbands, stick straight locks and crimping (low point)?! Due to these myriad of terrible hair decisions I have made, I'm striving for a more classic look which I like to describe as ""I woke up and did my hair on purpose"". If you are wanting to look adequately attractive without putting in too many hours (CUZ CRIMPING TOOK HOURS), then this dryer is for you! It actually worked better than my roundbrush and dryer that I've grown doing.
You can even do this one handed! Finally you'll have an extra hand to do the things you love like bake bread and take up smoking...
HOWEVER, be warned- the hot setting gets REAL hot, so use heat protectant and go have a great hair day!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I wanted to love this, but I don't even like it. It's super easy to use once you get the hang of it, but it just doesn't do much for me. I have a lot of long, thick, wavy hair so I wasn't expecting a game changer, but I was hopeful it would at least do something...it did nothing. It took forever because I had to section my hair into such small pieces to get it to work. When I use a regular round brush/blow dryer combo, I can use larger, thicker sections so it's easier/faster. Also, it's terrible around the root area, probably because it's so big & unweidly, it just doesn't do much for all the effort.",2,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Love, love, love this hair dryer! Had it on my wishlist and my husband bought it for me for Christmas. Used it next day and it literally took me 5 minutes to do my hair. I habitually leave the house with wet hair because I'm in a rush and too lazy to take the time to style my hair unless it's a special occasion or I need a pick me up and have extra time. I have medium length, medium thickness hair. This was super easy to maneuver and left a nice sheen to my dark hair.
I also used this on my two daughters' super thick, wavy hair. It worked fine, but I was not as proficient using this on another person's hair. I think it will take more practice for me to get used to using it on someone else.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
I purchased this product late Sept. and tried to use it on my long bob late Oct. but it did nothing. I work nights at a hospital so it's often takes me a while to try / do things. I started the process of returning it but came down with Bronchitis. I felt better and was able to move around but my return code had expired the 12th of Nov and I was barely going to go return it the 14th. Now I'm stuck with something that does not work and I paid $4x.xx and has since been on sale for $29.xx twice. What a waste of money.,1,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I am a complete dweeb when it comes to styling my hair. I like it to look good, be smooth, and have body but I do t have a lot of patience or skill to usually make those things all happen.
Enter this magic tool and all my hair goals have been achieved! It really does make my color-treated hair feel soft and smooth with very little product, and so much body and bounce. This is the first time me using a hair tool has warranted people asking me if I’d been to the salon for a blowout. It’s very easy to use and does not tangle or get caught in my hair, au contraire it glides through and smoothes away any frizziest or fly-aways. The only negatives are that it is HUGE and really really loud. Other than those two mi or inconveniences, this is a fantastic item and I would recommend to anyone who wants pretty, soft, shiny hair.",4,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I cannot say enough good things about this hair dryer! It is the holy grail dryer I have been looking for! I took a few weeks to write this review because I saw some of the reviews said that the dryer died out on them, but for me--so far so good. I have naturally wavy, fine hair, but a ton of it. Many years ago, I used a Connair dryer which gave me all sorts of frizz and took an hour for me to dry my hair. I switched to a $200 professional dryer which cut my drying time down to 45 minutes and gave me less frizz (using a round brush to dry my hair). But drying my hair was so time consuming I only did it once a week. I saw an advertisement for this dryer on Instagram and decided to buy it via Amazon. It did not disappoint! I dried my hair in 20 minutes. TWENTY minutes! (insert: angelic singing) It was so fast and easy! No more achy arms from holding up a dryer and trying to wrap my hair around a round brush! And it was straight, frizz-free and looked like a got a blow out. I feel beautiful! Ladies, do yourself a favor--if you have curly or wavy hair that takes forever to dry, give this dryer a try. It's so amazing; I already bought it for my bestie too who has similar hair texture and length. One thing, this dryer gets HOT so make sure to use a good serum/leave in conditioner that protects your hair from heat. I use the drybar Hot Tody. I've never had sleeker hair. I saw other reviews that the dryer was smoking but its actually your hair releasing steam from the heat. It happens at my hair salon when my stylist dries my hair too.",5,2,B01LSUQSB0
"I was influenced to by this after so many people raved about it. I will say, it does a good job of drying your hair quickly (if you let it air dry for a bit first). I personally have very fine and wavy to curly hair, so I do find that this makes my hair even more frizzy than when I use a regular blow dryer. I still have to flat iron or curl my hair after using this, so it's not the one stop shop I was hoping for. Maybe if you have a more manageable hair type this would be the perfect solution for you!",3,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I love this product. It gives you a salon blow out and home. I have long, thick indian hair that is naturally wavy, curly, bent, has a mind of its own, you name it. This makes my hair look sleek, beautiful, and it feels SO so soft. Two things though: i've had this a little under a year now, and when I turn it on, it gives off a horrible burning smell for a few seconds. I suspect it might be my own hair trapped inside. And two: the motor sounds louder and louder every time I use it now, and some of the bristles are bent after a lot of use. I think this may be just natural wear/tear, and i'm probably going to buy a new one anyway because I literally can't live without this tool now that I know what it can do!",4,0,B01LSUQSB0
"My hair doesn't end up burning in the back end like a hair dryer. It combs out the hair nice and smooth. The heat is right for the method and my hair is smooth after drying, not all tangled. I have waist length, stick straight, thin hair, but lots of it and this works really well. I'm not going for straight hair, but that's what I've got and it makes it smooth and dry and combed out with a soft end. I've never been able to do the round brush hair dryer mess. I don't have enough hands, so this takes care of that for me. Time is cut down. My only negative thought is that the handle is kinda wide for my hand, but the dryer guts gotta go somewhere. It doesn't hamper use.",4,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I originally saw this on facebook being sold by a third party. I decided to see if a reputable company had something similar and Revlon did. I lack coordination to work a brush and hairdryer. With this, I went from spending 20+ minutes on my hair and ending up with frizz out the wazoo, to 10 minutes and a sleek finish. You can use this to straighten or produce gently curls. I even use it to get that blown back look. My grandma liked it so much she's growing her hair out so she can buy one.

Only disclaimer, it is pretty heavy. Not so bad that you need hulking muscles but heavy enough that your arms may get tired after a bit. I also recommend turning it off between sections because it will travel when you set it down. So far it has survived several tumbles off of my vanity.",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"Bought the Product and in the first usage it stopped working and most probably the motor inside the product got burnt.

Since, I have imported the product, I am not getting any customer support as well.",1,41,B01LSUQSB0
So I hardly ever review an item but after seeing this all over the place I had to try it and I LOVE it. I’m a stay at home mom of 3 and I hardly get time to do my hair I’m always a mess. I recently cut my hair short and I loved the blow out look my hairdresser gave me and this “hair dryer” gave me that same look. If you are used to a super straight sleek look you will not like this product because it does Add a ton of volume to your hair. It is loud but my 4 month old slept right through it. I usually shower at night so my hair will dry naturally and I straighten it if I have time. I absolutely love this product but I do have short hair it’s about to my chin but it’s super thick and takes hours to dry normally. With this maybe 10-15 minutes from getting straight out of the shower.,5,0,B01LSUQSB0
I have curly hair and this makes straightening a breeze. However you have to be sure to use a heat protector and I’m expecting the motor to go out any day even though I’ve only had it for a couple months. It absolutely cannot be turned on high which I tried to do once and it smelled like it was burning up. Also felt like it was burning my hair. my hair is thin and short and so I am able to dry it pretty quickly on the low setting but cannot use it on my daughters hair which is thick and long because it would take an hour to dry.,3,0,B01LSUQSB0
"As an African American woman I was definitely skeptical. I got this for my daughter for Christmas because she has a hard time drying her hair because it is so thick. I really didn't think it would work. Let me tell you, she was able to dry her hair in less time and without all of the frustration. Then I used it and was hooked. She doesn't want to share so I guess I'm buying another one.",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I've had this for about three weeks now and I still have yet to find a technique that works for my hair. I have naturally curly hair that I like to have straight and I've noticed it's more difficult to use on hair that's not naturally straight or wavy. My hair gets frizzy and flat when I use this, not sure how people are getting so much volume. I also have lots of babyhairs that make it difficult to style without burning my skin. I am constantly trying new techniques to get the results I want but it's a challenge not to grab my blowdryer and straightener and do it myself.",3,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I am not the person to write reviews but I felt that I had to let people know how much this product is going to change my life. I have extremely thin hair and I've kept it pretty short for the past few years (shoulder length or slightly above). It's also VERY curly/wavy so my usual go to is BB Creme and a diffuser and out the door. However lately I have been feeling very bland and have started to straighten my hair more with a flat iron but was disappointed in the effect. I then tried the brush straightener and was even more disappointed. Due to my thin hair the straighteners weigh it down and give me 0 volume and it's usually pretty oily but the end of the day. I used this Revlon One-Step Hair Dryer for the first time this morning on my straight out of the shower hair and OMG do I feel fierce today! It was so easy to use, because trust me... I am NOT coordinated enough to do the round brush and blow dryer scenario. I have volume at my roots, my hair feels light as a feather and not weighed down, my ends for once in my life feel soft and full instead of crispy and hard. Whenever I get a blow out like this from my hair salon I can easily do dry shampoo for 2 days so I am eager to see if the same thing happens with this product. This is seriously a freaking game changer for me and it feels amazing.

My routine for reference: shower and use normal shampoo and conditioner, TRESemme Thermal Creations Heat Spray, Revlon One-Step Dryer, TRESemme Smooth Hairspray. Took me maybe 20 minutes max for shoulder length naturally curly/wavy hair! Amazingly simple.",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I loved it until it quit on me. This was a great styling tool, but only lasted about six months (I used it 1-2 times per week, and rarely on very wet hair.)

If you had asked me to rate this a month ago, I’d have given it 5-stars, then it quit in the middle of doing my hair that’s all she wrote. Major bummer! Way too much money for a tool that didn’t last.",2,One,B01LSUQSB0
"Game changer! I’ve never been able to achieve a blown out look on my own, my hair always looks fabulous when I get it done professionally but I’ve given up on trying to separate my hair and blow dry with a brush and dryer. I just could never manage the coordination. Flat ironing my hair just made my hair flat and blah. I was skeptical about my ability to achieve a blown out look with yet another beauty tool but I decided to give it a try with the recommendation of a friend. If I can do it, anyone can! I have long thick hair. My first time drying damp/wet hair took me about 20 minutes! And it looked great. Plenty of YouTube videos to learn tips and tricks.
Like any hot styling tool, you run the risk of burning your hand or scalp so obviously you need to be careful.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
I love this!! I’m a person that air dries my hair because it’s so thick and long that it takes forever to blow dry. So this is really nice to have. It only takes me like 10 minutes to dry and blow out my whole head vs a blow dryer and a brush would take more then 30 minutes. My only 2 complaints would be hair wraps around the brush and it continues to heat that hair and kinda smells like it’s burning. But only the hair that’s coming out like a normal hair brush. And two it’s louder then I thought it would be.,4,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I bought this tool to replace having to use two hands when finishing off my hair with a round brush and a hairdryer. I saw some reviews that said this dryer doesn’t really dry well but I dry my hair with my regular hairdryer to about 80% and then use this tool on the low setting to finish it off. It works perfect for that. I find the low setting to be a little too hot so I work quickly. The cord is too short so I returned it and bought a Hot Tools version which I’m sure is made by the same company. It works exactly the same but costs more. If you want spend less, buy Revlon’s version. If you want a longer cord, buy Hot Tools version. They are identical.",4,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I watched many YouTube videos before deciding to purchase this. All the reviews were so promising. I have LONG, THICK hair—we’re talking down to my waist and hair bands breaking when trying to do a ponytail. I love the blown out look but have never had the patience because my hair is so long and thick. This dryer provided the “blow out” look to my hair working I’d say 20 minutes. I don’t know if I’ll ever go back to the dryer/flat iron approach again. ***Please be advised that there is a knockoff version available on Amazon for $20 less, but it’s not worth it according to video reviews. The knockoff does not have the cool tip so in order to not burn your hand, you have to wear the glove. I found that I used the cool tip the entire time I dried my hair. Just spend the $60–it’s soooo worth it!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"This tool is great for blow drying hair for a smooth sleek straight style. It cuts the drying time in half!!! I have very thick wavy hair, and when I use this tool I am out the door with beautiful hair in no time. Others have complained of breakage and too drying to the hair. This tool should not be ""held"" in one place with the hair wrapped around it. It should be run through without stopping so as not to damage hair. You wouldn't hold a blow dryer in one place for an extended time now would you? Highly recommend this tool, I have had it for over a month and find this is my dryer of choice!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I went to two local big stores for products and the price was almost twice as much as Amazon for the same brush. Arrived quickly with Prime and love the volume and shine this adds to my 66 year old hair. I just got a fairly short bob with hair coming just below ears and layered in the back. It still works on my hair and adds so much volume that I feel like my hair stylist did it. I use a Chi heat guard spray, add Guts mousse and then hair style extender cream by Living Proof and my style stays in! Love this and at this price it would make great presents for relatives and friends. My daughter introduced it to me and I love how her long hair looks styled with it. Can't go wrong.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I've seen tons of awesome reviews and ""You have to get one of these"" type posts in several Facebook ""mom groups"" that I am in. I bought it on Prime Day 2020, but was a little underwhelmed at the results compared to my normal blow drying with a brush.

Don't get me wrong, it does smooth out your hair when you blow dry, but it is a little heavy (especially compared to blow drying with a brush), and I still felt like I needed to run a straightener over my hair--just not as much as if I had only used a dryer/brush.

If I can ever remember to take pics, I'll upload those. Still worth the price of $30ish when I got it on sale. I don't know that I would pay full price, though.",4,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Tom’s wife here- this is amazing! I have very thick, long, coarse, curly hair. I got a Brazilian blowout which helps but I still needed to blow dry straight. A blow dryer and a brush is such a pain in every way. I saw this, read the reviews, and bought it hoping for the best but not holding my breath. It delivers! Cuts down on drying time sooo much. Easier to operate than two things at once for sure- saving my arms and frustration level for sure. I dii I d not find it any louder than a blow dryer either. The only con is that the handle is large and I have small hands but that’s not a huge deal. Overall completely satisfied and would recommend to anyone 🤗",4,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I have been wanting one of these dryers for a bit, and it had been recommended by a few friends. Unfortunately, I got a defective one. It smelled odd when I first used it, but I thought it was possibly a new use smell. I've since used it twice more and the smell has gotten worse. I'm a few days out of the 30 day return window and Amazon won't replace it. They would return it minus a restocking fee, and then I'd have to buy it again for more money since I first bought it on sale. All in all, I'm pretty disappointed. It seems like a solid hot air brush, and I just got a defective one.
I found a few other reviews that mention a burning smell, as well. So, if you smell anything weird when you first get this, learn from my lesson and immediately send it back.",1,One,B01LSUQSB0
"It died after 30 seconds of being on. It was extremely hot so I thought letting it cool for an hour would help, but it didn’t, still wouldn’t turn on. I ordered a replacement and that was lost in shipping so I had to cancel that one. You’d think they’d send another replacement since they lost my replacement, but no, I have to reorder it again. Not sure if all this is worth it. Very frustrating.",1,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I got this as a Christmas gift and I've used it for a month now. I LOVE this product but BEWARE!!! It is very loud!!! I've noticed a ringing in my ears ever since I started using it. I usually put a wad of tissue or toilet paper in my ears before using this product but I'm going to buy some actual ear plugs. I love how my hair looks after using it though so it's worth it to wear ear plugs. I have thick, wavy, and course hair. My hair would be so frizzy after using a typical blow dryer that I'd have to use a flat iron to smooth it out. This product dries my hair so fast, leaves it nice and smooth with a little wave, and gives nice amount of volume in half the time it would take to blow dry then straighten. I gave it 4 starts only because of how loud it is. Otherwise, I would give it 5 stars.",4,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Every white woman on instagram has one of these so I really didn’t want to be like Basic Barbie and get one: HOWEVER, it’s totally worth it. I have thin, wavy hair and when it dries, I look like I’m Belatrix LeStrange. This makes my hair super soft and manageable, not to mention it takes 15 minutes to do my whole head!!",5,2,B01LSUQSB0
"At first try, I was close to returning it, but on second chance I am keeping it. The first time I tried it, my hair was still very wet and then looked crazy and matted down. That being said, you can dry your hair fully with this, but I reccomend to air dry your hair to about 85% then use this dryer. Very easy to use. Drying power is great and good temperature control.",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I am painfully lazy when it comes to my hair. Up until buying this hot brush I didn't own a hair dryer or flat iron for the past 2 years. Air drying my hair for the past 4. I wanted to change it up, but I knew myself and I knew that if I was going to do anything to my hair it has to be easy and quick and feel part of what I already do. I already brush my hair, so this just adds another feature and it is the HOLY GRAIL. I sent a picture to my best friends and the women in my family and just saying, I should have a promo code because three of them bought one. They didn't even recognize me.
PROS: My hair felt and looked like I went to a salon in 4 minutes. The wand is so easy to run through your hair wet. I have very wavy thin hair so it tangles easily and I didn't experience one snag while styling my hair. It doesn't feel like an extra step or a hassle for my fellow lazy ladies.

CONS: I don't have any cons other than the brush being a lot larger than expected but now I don't mind that because larger surface area=quicker styling and drying.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"As someone with very long, thick, and curly hair, I always dread having to straighten my hair. It usually takes me a good 2-3 hours to straighten, but not anymore, all because of this brush! I purchased this product on March 1, 2020, and have used it countless times since. I personally don't straighten my hair more than a couple of times a year, but when I do, it is much easier due to this product and saves me half the time. I also do many people's hair, including my mom, friends, and relatives. Their hair is much thinner and shorter than mine and has a wavy texture so it is much easier to deal with. I always use this product before heat-styling anyone's hair, whether straightening or curling it, and it makes it look so much better and saves me tons of time! As I said before, my hair is a lot harder to deal with due to its texture, length, and thickness, so the brush does not work as well on it. It will get rid of the curls, which helps a lot when I straighten it, but it will puff up really fast afterward. With the hair of my friends and family members, it will take me about 10 minutes to blow dry and then only 15 to straighten, usually taking no more than 30 minutes! With their hair, I will go over each strand with the blowdryer 2-3 times, depending on how big the strand is, and then it will flatten in about 2 times with the straightener, which is extremely efficient. All aspects considered, I would definitely recommend this product, it has saved me a large amount of time and energy!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I love the look of a fresh blowout, but I don't have the limitless budget or endless hours ahead of work to sit in the salon chair every day and get it done. This is a HOLY GRAIL hair tool. I like to rough dry my hair for about 5-8 minutes before hand, but then I quickly section it off and pull this tool through and I have the rich lady hair of my dreams within 10 minutes. I will never have a bad hair day again!

It is the perfect quick fix to make you look polished and like you tried, even though it is quicker than fully blow drying + straightening. I'll sometimes add some curls to it after to give it a beachy vibe, but most days I just run it through and go. My only complaint is on the ""hot"" setting, it is a little loud and has a slight whistle to it, though I'm willing to ignore that for the 10 minutes I use it for. You'll never look too ""done"" with this, or undone, alternatively. It strikes the perfect balance of effortless and quick. I am SO happy I bought this and it ended up coming via same day shipping. Can't beat it!",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"Love this as an all in one hairstyling tool. As someone that would dry and flat iron my hair everyday, this certainly cuts down on the time it takes to do my hair every morning. I have super thick wavy hair that usually takes 15-20 mins to do. This bad boy cuts the time in half. I was also surprised to see that it actually did look like I had a blow out at the salon😀. The only down side is you really do not have much control over the temperature. Definitely will want to use a good heat protectant so as not to fry your hair!",4,One,B01LSUQSB0
"Great product!!! Love it!!
I have extremely curly hair. Blow drying with a hair dryer and a brush was intense workout and a very time consuming process. Having curly hair it was a pain to balance both. With this Revlon one step hair dryer it has cut my blowout time by 80%. First time using this products you will get the burnt air smell but it doesn’t last long. It’s thick and a little heavy but worth it. I don’t need to part my hair to blowout any more. I can just comb it using the brush and get the same result. It does leave your hair a little frizzy by the roots but apply some thermal cream to your roots before blow drying it helps or use some shine or anti frizz after blow drying it. You won’t be disappointed with this product. I am amazed how much this has helped cut my home blow out sessions. No need for blow dryers or flat irons when you have this.",4,0,B01LSUQSB0
"This is great! I don’t think I will ever flat iron my hair again. This makes my hair so shiny and pretty. One thing i did notice is that if you use the highest heat setting it can produce a little smoke, im not sure what thats about. I really wouldnt recommend using the highest setting though. I use the low heat setting on damp hair to dry it and once its mostly dry i go over it with the highest heat once or twice to smooth and defrizz. I’ve also noticed that I have to be careful in how I angle the brush otherwise my hair gets stuck on certain parts of the frame / edges and hurts and cannot get loose. Being careful and aware while you use this is a good practice. But, i get beautiful blowout hair in less than 40 minutes from wet, which is a great improvement for someone with curly hair who originally had to air dry or blow dry hair, then flat iron, and the process would take an hour or longer. This has really given me the choice to have pretty hair whenever i want",4,0,B01LSUQSB0
"OK i NEVER write reviews cause i’m so lazy. I have curly hair 3A. and i’ve damaged my hair so much from straightening it, which is why it’s so short now </3, so i decided to stick to blowing it out instead. (idk i’m
not a scientist) BUT i watched so many reviews before buying this and it’s amazing.

PROS:
It’s easy to use
Easy to style with (u can see the curled ends which BTW last me like 3-4 days)
It doesn’t take that much time (takes me 30minutes?)
Leaves my hair feeling silky and nice c:

CONS:
heat control. there’s only 3 settings. and the high heat setting is suppper hot so be cautious and aware not to fry ur hair!
Kind of big so hard to get ur roots super straight

personally, i start off by combing my entire hair flat against my head with it on a cool setting, with my hair already about 80% air dry. then i section it off into pieces, go on cool through the pieces then use high to finalize and curl the ends. at the very end i put a silk wrap on it or beanie if i’m lazy (i’m not a fan of sm volume cause my hair is so thick already) and this flattens it a bit (so i can avoid using the flat iron)
first time i did it... took me maybe an hour and after a while the time has gone down since i got the hang of it :)

hope this review helps someone out there :3 this is ur sign to buy it! ^~^ worth the price for sure",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I am not a hairstylist or cosmetologist, so I can say with certainty that this is a great product for everyday people who want that “fresh out of the salon blow out” look. I have tried to use a round brush with a blow dryer tons of times and it never looks right and takes FOREVER! My sister-in-law recommended this to me, she has thin blonde hair. I thought it would work for me because I have thick brunette hair (bleached). But to my surprise it not only works but it cuts my dry/style time down by more than half. I love this product more than my makeup.

The only thing I recommend you also need to use this product is a heat style glove. I use the highest setting and with the steam of my wet hair it almost burned my hand holding the other side of the dryer. Otherwise I use this everyday on dry hair to spruce from the day before and after putting on olaplex 6 and 7 after a shower.

My photos are a before and after using the revlon one-step dryer. The first photo is a quick dry of the roots after a shower, leaving the ends still damp.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
I happened to find a review in a popular magazine whether the One Step Revlon dryer was worth the hype. I agree with the article that it is! I use it every day now over my other favorite blow dryer. .I usually use all the dryer speeds depending on how much a hurry I’m in. I really love this dryer brush. I watched a you tube video on how others mastered this brush. If you have short hair it might not be for you because the brush is quite large to wrap your hair around— but if your hair is shoulder length or longer you will love it too.,5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"GUYS let me tell you - I am not one to do my hair, get it styled or style it myself for that matter unless I go to the salon to get it done. That is just me. I got this for Christmas and it has been my LIFESAVER for work. I used to sleep with my hair wet or just air dry it and it always left my hair feeling coarse. If I dry my hair with this product it will leave me with salon straight hair for days! I don’t even have to wash my hair as often anymore!!! Using this has definitely opened the gateway for my to invest more in my hair. HIGHLY RECOMMEND! I work full time, go to school full time and I have a 1 year old. This product has literally saved my hair!!!!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"OMG! So my stylist recommended this. She said only get this one bc the Revlon is the “ only one that really works)....

This was the first time I used it and the results were perfect. Looks like I went to a blow out bar. I have A LOT of hair. It never got tangled like a roller brush does. I was completely done in less than 15 mins. I’m going to get rid of all my other styling tools. This is a must have!",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"At first I was in absolute love with this dryer! It made my hair look so full, shiny and voluminous! But shortly after, the bristles began to bunch together lost their shape and stiffness. They are all bent and sideways now, and I've only had this dryer since December!! Last night it started to smoke and make this clucking noise, it became too hot to hold and stunk up the room because it also smelled like something was burning. Clearly isn't the best quality, it barely lasted me 3 months! I loved the results so I wish it would have lasted longer, but I would recommend against getting this. Put in some more money and get a better quality volumizer that'll last longer!",2,0,B01LSUQSB0
"This was literally delivered as I was stepping out of the shower. Perfect timing!
I have color treated hair and even round brushing it I still notice frizzy ends. Honestly this dryer shocked me on how well it worked. And look! No frizzy ends. Simply put? Awesome!
However I wouldn’t call it a volumizer because my hair is very flat after drying. However I didn’t use any products either.
I HATE the on/off handle because you literally have to let go of your hair to change the speed or temp. The on/off switch is “chapstick” style. Twists at the bottom. I much prefer the push on/off style. But all that said I’m giving it five stars because my hair is soft and shiny and not frizzy. The brush part doesn’t even get tangled in your hair. It actually feels really good. The back of my hair is a stacked cut so it’s shorter but the brush grabbed right on. I would call this a must have for 2019. A great value for the price.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I had no idea I would like this so much… I have never been skilled at blow drying my hair using a round brush. I would just blow dry it, it would be crazy and then I would have to flat iron it. Washing my hair was always such a chore because of what I would have to do afterwards. I saw this and I read all the reviews and decided to give it a try. It is the best thing, hands down, that I’ve ever bought for my hair. I tell everyone about it. I almost got a cheaper, generic brand because I had such low expectations, but decided to just get the Revlon. Definitely worth it.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I wanted to like this as I bought it based on influencer reviews and watched like 10 youtube videos before pulling the trigger. However, it just didn't work for me. I am Asian but have very thick frizzy hair. Usually I get the japanese straightening treatment, but since I was pregnant, I couldn't do it, so i thought this would be a good idea. However, it took super long, and it got so hot that I started sweating and felt like I needed another shower ha! I had better luck using a John Frieda frizz serum and just blowdrying with a traditional hairdryer + brush combo. Returned it as it wasn't for me, but it might work for some others!",3,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Why did I not buy this sooner???? My mom has an expensive version of this and she’s been telling me to get one but I wasn’t gonna pay what she did for one. Saw this on Buzzfeed and the reviews intrigued me, and the price wasn’t bad, so I thought why not?
I LOVE this thing!! It’s cut my drying/styling time in half and my hair is so smooth! And looks so much healthier! It took a couple times to get used to using it, but I’m telling you, it’s soooo worth the price tag. You won’t regret buying this.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I have seen people rave about this on social media for the last year, and finally decided to purchase one when it went on sale. I have naturally straight hair which is pretty easy to fix, so I was not sure if I would actually need this. However, the first time I used it, I realized it was totally worth it. I have not yet tried it on fully wet hair, but it is an awesome way to revive hair that is not freshly washed. I sleep in a ponytail and wake up with flat hair and a ponytail crease. With this, I used a little dry shampoo and ran this through my hair in sections, brushing upward from underneath for about 5 minutes, and it looks like a fresh blowout. Very impressed!",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"Upon receiving the item I found the packaging rather torn up and 're-taped' as shown in the picture but just thought it was poor packaging. The brush was loosely placed in the box separate from the coverings in the box. I realized the brush handle had white marks on it and still just made myself think it was poor packaging/handling because i was dying to LOVE this. But then I saw the hairs. I pulled most out before i remembered that i should take a picture. I am a brunnette and these where blonde, some ombre, hairs. I am beyond disgusted and shocked that I would receive something so obviously used like this.",1,One,B01LSUQSB0
"Pros:
Super quick dry
Leaves hair really shiny
Lots of volume

Just an Observation
I have a short bob, and my hair wasn’t really long enough to properly use this. I had to go back and flat iron it after.

Cons
The place where you would natural rest your dominate hand is the same place where the temperature dials are, so you constantly hit them and the temperature changes.

Do not hold the device like you would a curling iron with both hands. Your non dominate hand will get burned.

The cold setting didn’t feel cold.

Meant for medium to long hair only.",3,0,B01LSUQSB0
I absolutely love this blow dryer!! But the reason why I did not give it a 5 star review is because when you turn it onto high the sound it makes while doing your hair is very loud. But if that wasn’t there this would get a 5 star review! I received it today and had to give it a shot! I love that I do not have to use my straightener after blow drying my hair! My hair usually takes awhile to blow dry my hair and with this it cuts the time in half! I have recommended to my friends and most of my family has one!,4,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I have medium length hair, a bit below my shoulder, and was excited about this product. The tool is pretty heavy and clunky to use, I found my arm getting tired before my hair was dry. It did not add much volume but did put a nice curl into my ends. Unfortunately with curl and dryness came a bad case of static electricity. I use a good shampoo, conditioner, leave in conditioner and heat protectant, before using this tool. The heat settings, there are 3, are too hot, even the cool setting. My hair did not tangle using this as the teeth are far enough apart. I can see how this may be better for short hair, but I am not impressed at using it on medium to long hair.",3,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Overall I liked it. Pros… It eliminates the need for a flat iron for me. I have pretty thick hair and usually after blow drying I have to flat iron. The round brush makes my hair very smooth. Cons...The high setting is very, very hot and very loud! It has a high pitch squeal in it as well that is not great for your ears long-term. The temperature is so hot that holding one end of the dryer at times can burn your fingers. You must be very careful. It’s also a little heavy do use for the amount of time that it takes to fully blow dry my hair. My hair is down to the middle of my back.",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"WHERE HAS THIS BEEN ALL MY LIFE?
seriously the best blow out I've ever had and I did it myself!!! It took my 15 mins to do my whole head and I have long thick hair.
The only thing I dont like is how Insanely hot it gets
Hack: use high setting to give ur hair a once over and partially smooth and dry then divide hair and finish it on low",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"Omg I love this dryer! I hate blow drying my hair...hate it!! I'm not coordinated enough to hold a blow dryer and a round brush so I end up looking like my hair exploded on my head!! This has been a game changer! I have AGA so I'm losing my hair. This gives me good volume and leaves my hair soft! I lose no more hair than brushing it and leaving it to dry in a bun. I use the low setting and it gives me enough heat to dry my hair. I have long hair (middle of my back) and thr low heat setting is good for me. The heat doesn't irrate my skin. It is a bit heavier than a regular hair dryer but way easier to use!! I've used this on my 5 year daughter and she loved it! It has a cold setting to use after you're done drying your hair. I would like to see this feature push out somewhat colder air but not sure if that's possible. Overall, this is now a permanent staple in our home!!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Well, I understand the hype now. I have wavy hair and usually I will blow dry, then use a flat iron to smooth it out. This was way quicker, although I was a little worried about the temperature and with no indication of how hot it was actually getting I just worked quickly. I have hair just above my shoulders which I prefer to be straight, but that was almost impossible to achieve without a curly bevel on the ends, even if I just got straight down. Maybe it takes some more finesse or practice. Overall I like it, and it will be convenient whenever I travel again.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I have thick, wavy, frizzy very coarse hair. (blonde pic is what my hair looks like without doing anything to it...just wash and go. The red head pic is after using this product only) I change my hair color often and so therefore that has also taken a toll on my hair these days. I usually have to dry it, flat iron it then curl the ends to make it look half way decent on most days (the humidity in the air here is not my hairs best friend either). I did not have high expectations for this product but was hoping that it would stand up to all the positive reviews and so I took a shot and bought it. Oh...am I ever glad I did! All I had to do is wash and dry my hair yesterday, nothing else! It looks/feels soft and healthy. I even woke up this morning expecting my hair to be its crazy self and nope...straight and soft! I highly recommend this product. One piece of advice...do your hair in sections. Yes it takes a little longer but will give you amazing results 😊 You will not be disappointed!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"As someone who never mastered the skills to use a curling iron, flat iron, and barely a hair dryer, I am over the moon with this tool! I have fine hair and had long ago resigned myself to air-drying my hair (not the best look but I work in a lab). Now, in just a few minutes, my usually quite damp hair is dry and glossy and styled. I have already received several compliments on my hair since my first use (jeez, was my hair THAT bad?). I have now pack bonded with my hot air brush and am considering naming it.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"So far so good! I’m not sure if they have tweaked the product in the last year or so because I have had no problems so far. Quite honestly, I don’t see myself ever going back to a regular blow dryer. It’s powerful, fairly light weight, and I don’t have to juggle a dryer and a round brush at the same time. My hair feels a lot softer and looks less frizzy as opposed to using a regular dryer. I used to have to straighten my hair in some areas after drying but with this product I can just go! I’ve kept the box just Incase it randomly stops working (as other reviewers have said in the past), but as of right now I’m loving it! It does take practice to learn how to hold the brush in the most comfortable way but once you get it it’s a life changer!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I am still learning how to use it, but so far, i love this!
I can dry my baby fine hair, without it feeling fried and breaking!
I got a new haircut (shoulder length, with defined layers) and this is the perfect tool to give me the new hairstyle i wanted.
I'm an 80's kid, so I'm used to lots of pouff and tons of hairspray.
With the right styling products (fructis root amp, aussie leave in conditioner, fructis freeze n shine hairspray) i have a little pouff, a more stylish hairdo and lots less heat damage to my hair!
So glad i took the plunge and bought it!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I purchased this because of the reviews saying you would get a salon blow out finish and they were right on the money. I am over 60 with long hair that is colored. The texture is frizzy and usually needs to be flat ironed to get it to behave, but honestly I used this today and my hair is smooth and bouncy.. just like when I go to the salon and the stylist does a blow out. I am very pleased.",5,2,B01LSUQSB0
"I am hair styling challenged - always have been. I have thick, coarse hair with just enough wave in it so that it doesn’t lie flat and shiny but not enough wave in it that I can throw some product in it and head out with that freshly-tousled look.

After decades of drying with a round brush and thousands of dollars of styling products, with the result being somewhat straighter-but-frizzy, I thought, ‘There has to be a better way.’ Flat irons made my hair too lifeless. Curling irons made it too bouncy.

Then I discovered hot air brushes. After reading tons of reviews, I figured I would try this one. I’ve used it twice and could not be happier. I finally have the thick, straight, shiny hair that until now has only been achievable at the salon.

There are a couple things I should warn you about. It gets hot AF on the barrel, so watch your little fingers when figuring out how to use it the first time. It’s also roughly the size of Thor’s hammer. You would think the combination of these two characteristics would make it a health hazard, but honestly, once I got the hang of it I had no trouble.",5,2,B01LSUQSB0
"I read so many positive reviews and couldn't wait to try this! This is seriously the best styling tool! It eliminates a blow dryer and flat iron. IT DOES IT ALL!!! My only regret is not purchasing this years ago when a friend recommended it. My hair is wavy and gets very frizzy when I blow it dry. This styling tool smooths it out so beautifully in 1/2 the time it took blowdrying and using a flat iron. If you are thinking about getting one DO IT, you will be in love!",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I mostly use this on Low, the other settings are too hot. This dryer is magic to my bangs! I have super thick wavy Mexican hair. It’s super long and hard to dry. I use this on my bangs and extra wavy areas after I blow dry my hair. If I use it without it blow drying first my hair gets too poofy. The only downside to this is it’s super wide in my hand and makes my wrist and hand sore if I use it too long. Sometimes I’ll take breaks in between. But it’s worth the hair magic!",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"My husband gave this to me as an early Christmas gift. I have a really good blow dryer and a pretty good straightener but im arms are always exhausted by the time finish my hair. With the Revlon One step dryer and straightener my hair is done in half the time and with only one tool. It leaves my hair so silk soft and still has volume and life unlike with a typical straightener. Ive seen some others on the market for double this price but no need to waste the money, you won't regret this purchase!!! Absolutely in love.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I was shocked when I saw how many great reviews this product had on here.

I’m not sure how many of these reviewers were influenced by the Hollie Woodward’s of the world but let’s add another one to that list - me.

Hot diggity dog this thing is AMAZING. The first time I used it I received so many compliments asking if I just had a blow out at drybar. My ends looked so fresh and healthy I imagine due to the round curling motion of the brush on the end. I will say it does get my hair super hot so I can’t touch the strand right after I dry it.

My only two opportunities for improvement I would suggest is 1) the packaging is sealed so well that it was a little difficult to get it out of the box! I ended up having to rip it open 2) it’s a little difficult to turn the knob from off to cool to low to high speed with one hand (if the other hand is being used to hold a section of your hair). With hair dryers that have buttons to press it’s pretty easy to hold the hair dryer in your other hand and press the button but I had to put hair dryer in between my legs or on the counter to turn the knob and then use. Not a huge deal just something different that I can absolutely get used too.

All in all, 10/10 would recommend and would buy again.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"My natural hair is wavy, long and very thick... after coloring it many times (some bleach too) it is now frizzy as well (yay me!) Straightening my hair usually takes me around two hours, blow drying they flat ironing . This magical device achieved that same result in 20 minutes!! And it's great for layered hair; gives you that salon-like blowdry..
Some notes:
I only use it on high.. be careful.. it does get too hot
The cool tip gets pretty hot after the brush is on for some time
Getting to the roots was the hardest I believe because the brush is too wide
Brush is perfectly wide for long hair..
All in all.. I give it 5 stars.. it's hot just like I want it, easy to use .. and does the job quickly",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Pros: dries my thick, medium- fine hair fast! I definitely see more volume and shine.
Cons: a) maybe it will take more practice but I find this dryer awkward and bulky to handle.
b) Also, I get loads more curl from my old regular dryer and round brush. The barrel of this dryer is oval so I find the flat sides iron out any slight curl the round sides managed to put in. I want more curl, not less! This dryer claims it can do that but I haven't figured out how yet.
c) Finally, the ""cool"" setting you'd use to lock in the curl or volume you just tried to make does not work on mine. There is zero temperature difference. A defect of my particular device, I suppose.
I would have returned this product but let the 30 day window lapse. Dang.",3,0,B01LSUQSB0
"First of all, this blow dryer changed my life. It’s so easy to use and makes me look like I’m fresh out of the salon. I would have given this 10 stars if I could - HOWEVER, the reason for the 3 stars, is because after about 3 months it started getting EXTREMELY loud, like I was using a power tool in the bathroom. Then today, after 6 months, it started making weird rattling noises and completely shut off and unfortunately has died :(

I am contemplating buying another because of how much I loved it. But will be pretty bummed if it craps out after 6 months again...",3,0,B01LSUQSB0
"This is by far the best hair dryer brush combo I've ever used. I have silky soft porn star hair! I feel like a bombshell everytime I use it. Not only has this drying brush brought me so much more self confidence, it's cut my ""getting ready time"" in half with how quickly it drys and smooths my hair. Which has made my husband immensely happy, and may possible cause us to have a 4th child, which I am debating on naming Revlon. Life changing dryer brysh!! I even bought my sister, mom, and mother in law one! Family affair!! Revlon, you've revolutionized me!!",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"Wow! I've only used this once and I wasn't really expecting too much from it. Way, way.... way back in the day, I had one of these when they were skinny and not so great. It never really did anything for my hair. I was expecting this to leave my hair dry, but frizzy and then have to flat iron it, but that wasn't the case. It dried quickly and left my hair smooth. All I had to do was add a shine enhancer after and I was good to go.",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I have thick wavy hair. Back in high school I would straighten my hair almost daily.. took me about an hour and a half to blow dry then straighten my hair. I was always in awe of the hairstylists when they could use a round brush and style my hair with a hairdryer. I am NOT skilled in blow drying or styling my hair whatsoever.

I recently stated leaving my hair naturally curly and using products and a diffuser to achieve this look. However I do prefer my hair straight, but had given up on this because it was too time consuming for me. On occasion I will treat myself to DryBar and I am in love with my hair. However, that’s 50 dollars a session so I only go on very special occasions.

I had been wanting to try this due to the rave reviews and I tried it for the first time today. I was able to achieve a look very similar to my blowouts at DryBar on my first try. (A little frizzer but not bad at all and I’ll take it, I’m not a professional). It took about 20 minutes total! (Faster than my curly days). I am in love with this product. If I can do it anyone can!!! I’d still go to dry bar probably on special occasions but now at least I have the flexibility to achieve a blowout at home 👏🏻 It is amazing. I am so happy.",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I bought this item prior to going abroad for 20 days in hopes of quick styling. It does indeed dry your hair fast and looks like a salon blow out. HOWEVER, I literally used it twice before I started smelling something BURNT and awful. It was actually kind of scary because I thought it was going to catch on fire. Thankfully I returned from vacation before my 30 days were up and could return this item. Otherwise I would have been stuck with this $60 (yes, it was $58 when I bought it) piece of nothing!!!! Save your money and the stress of having to return it.",1,One,B01LSUQSB0
"WOW! I’ve seen reviews and YouTube videos praising this product and being the minimalist I am I had to try it. A product that can dry and give my hair body/style at the same time, yes please! So, first impression, WOW. There are so many ways I could have dried my hair to give it more added body, but simply drying it without product gave it noticeable body and curl (depending on how I manipulated the dryer). I can’t beleive I used to dry my hair with a round brush in one and a dryer in the other- NEVER AGAIN. Great product for anyone!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"This hair dryer is amazing! I was really skeptical when a friend told me about it because it usually takes me a long time to blow dry my hair and then I would have to use a curling wand or hair straightener to get rid of frizzies or fly always. This hairdryer takes care of that in a shorter period of time! I’ve been so impressed! I have stopped using my expensive professional hair dryer!
UPDATE 7/2020 - Still love this hair dryer but over the last few months, it makes this high pitch, ear piercing noise when I am using it. It's super annoying and sounds like it may catch on fire, but it still works. It's just making a really annoying sound!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I really like this product and I do feel like it works well. I'm honestly not sure how people use this to STYLE their hair. I just use it to dry my hair to then flat iron. Beware, it can get REALLY hot and hurt your scalp so I tend to not dry too close to my scalp. I also think the cool setting is worthless... but I just use my regular blow dryer when I need the cool setting. Overall, it's really great and much easier for those of use who struggle to use the blow dryer/brush combo lol.",4,0,B01LSUQSB0
"If you have a natural curlier pattern - I'm talking 4A and up - do not expect this blow dryer to cut your blow-dry time down by too much. Don't get me wrong , it works very well BUT I have very thick, coarse, curly hair so detangling and sectioning is key. That said, this dryer - for me - worked best when I sectioned my hair into smaller sections when wet. The end product was virtually straight and the rots were amazing! Anyone with curly hair know it can be difficult to get the roots straight with a blow-dryer along.

I'd suggest this product to people who can patiently detangle and section their wet hair because it doesn't necessarily brush through knots well.

My new go to for wash day.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Update: 7/27/2019

I gave the dryer away. It is just way to massive around for my thin fine bob. I gave it to my niece who has very thick curly hair, I would not recommend this for thin hair.

I have a short bob type cut that usually falls below my ears. My hair is very thin and also very fine, it is also silver. I was hoping for something that would add volume. So far I'm not seeing that much difference. It does take a few days to get used to it so I'm hoping it improves. I think its okay but not any great improvement over using round brush and dryer. Very soft bristles tho, which I have to say is my favorite thing. Grateful it has a cool setting as well as a place to hold with both hands without getting burned. Overall a decent product but it wont work miracles",4,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Where has this product been all my life!?! I LOVE it. Let me explain - i’m a 51 yr old female with thick, course hair. I’ve always dread styling my hair even with the invention of the flat iron and smoothing products., etc. i bought this recently just overhearing my daughter’s conversation with a friend. So I jumped on Amazon and thought, well I’ll give it a try. This thing dried my hair quickly, and easily. And my hair looks like I spent hours on it. I spent about :5 and was done and happy!! Highly recommend!",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I just don’t understand the hype. I’m glad others are having such positive experiences with it but mine wasn’t too great. It took forever to dry my hair despite it being ridiculously hot and it didn’t make my hair as shiny as it is when I just straighten it regularly. It also didn’t look like a salon blowout even though I followed the instructions on how to use it to achieve that look. Literally just looks like I straightened my hair. Also, WAY too much smoke comes from my hair when I use this. It must be completely frying it.",3,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I caved and bought this after several women I know kept raving about it. It was the Treasure Truck deal one day so I figured why not. I have really crappy hair. It is extremely fine with natural frizz on the ends. Even my stylist says my hair is very difficult. I washed my hair and tried this bad boy out. Holy smokes. It was like I had gotten a salon blow out. It totally eradicated the frizz on the bottom of my insanely fine hair. I love it so much, I even pack and carry it in my suitcase on trips and that is a HUGE hassle. It weighs a good bit and takes up what room I would otherwise use for sneakers. (I travel professionally for work). The only caveat is that it gets very hot, but using a heat protectant on your hair and alternating the settings between cool and low and high will help. I highly recommend this!!",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"Would’ve rated a 4.5 if i could. I haven’t touched my straightener or blow dryer since buying this product. It takes about 15-20 min to dry AND straighten my soaking wet hair completely (my hair is very long, wavy, has medium thickness but I have a LOT of it). It takes my hair about 4-6 hours to air-dry after a shower, for reference.

Yeah, the metal gets hot, you obviously wouldn’t hold a straightener in the same spot for too long, so don’t try it with this dryer. This is still a hot tool, it can burn your hair. Since it’s also a brush, I would recommend cleaning it out every 2-3 uses to avoid burning the hair stuck between the bristles, and to keep consistent airflow. I get a faint smell of burning hair after turning it on occasionally, but that goes away after cleaning out the bristles.

I’ve had long hair my entire life, and barrel brushes have always been the enemy. Took some getting used to, I still get the whole thing stuck in my hair sometimes; I just turn it off and rebrush before styling again.",4,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I was looking into buying a Dyson. But as we all know, they are expensive!! I saw a lot of good reviews for this and thought I would give it a try. Honestly did not think this would work good because it is so inexpensive! But let me tell you, it does! I love this thing so much! I don’t think I have loved another tool quicker than this one. I would definitely recommend using it on the cool setting to protect your hair.",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"Loved the idea of a combination dryer and brush styler, HOWEVER, this is extremely awkward and heavy to use! The handle is about twice the size of the average hairbrush and the hairbrush end is 'weighted' so using it is a bit difficult. The heat is ample, the dryer 'works' as it should, but I do not recommend . I'd like to think the manufacture will correct this oversized wonderful idea. Go to Target and handle their display model before purchasing. Use clips to section dry/style your hair. It's a great idea that just didn't feel comfortable for my older hands.",2,0,B01LSUQSB0
"This is a handicapped persons dream!!! I look and feel pretty ratty everyday because I don’t have strength and control on my left side. Drying and styling conventionally is so hard. I have curly, frizzy hair. I just inboxed it, used it within a few minutes and I am done with shining real person hair by myself in about three minutes. This is s huge step forward towards independence and self worth. And even on my locked in days any loved one could easily use it to make me feel human without hair skill. This was suggested to me from my rare disease group and I am a truly truly thankful person!!",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I have THICK CURLY hair. Like ringlets curly. This product was recommended to me by a straight haired friend, and I never thought it would work, but- it is amazing!!!!

Honestly I dried my hair about 80% with my regular hand dryer, and then used the brush dryer to complete it. It does exactly what it says it will. Straightened my hair, gave me a little volume, and it was so much easier to use than the traditional brush/ blow dryer separate method. I am in love with this thing!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I am horrible at drying my hair. I have very dull straight hair and i usually let it just airdry and frizz up, making me look like a mess. I never blow dry it because I don’t know how to, I always end up tangling my hair in the brush and burning myself with the heat. My stepmom got this item and i decided to try it. The only thing i can say is, “WOW”! I absolutely love it! It is so easy use and so quick. My two cousins and my aunt tried it as well, all four of us have very different hair textures, volume, and type of hair, and they all loved it! I am super happy with this purchase! Also, i got it on Amazon prime day so i saved some money with that, awesome deal! I look like a mess in the picture haha but that was my first time trying it! My hair looks so shiney and silky, i am obsessed!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I have long, thick hair which takes FOREVER to dry and this has been a game changer. Even after being fresh out of the shower I was able to dry my hair in considerably less time than with a traditional hair dryer and round brush. The results are fantastic as well; my hair is smooth, soft and frizz free and has a great bounce after using the Revlon one step dryer. My only complaint, if you could even call it that, is that I wish there was another setting. The settings are cool, low, and high and sometimes high feels a tad warm. After spending hundred on high end hair dryers for them to only burn out after a year and take over and hour to dry my hair, this under $40 device is something everyone who regularly blow dries their hair needs!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"As you can see me hair is very wavy/curly and I have to use ALOT of product to try to tame it down because of the frizz. I have to say that I have attempted many times in my life to blow dry my own hair and it has been a giant frizz disaster after trying to dry which takes me about 45min to an hour unless I have it professionally done and by that I mean, I am Dominican so get my hair done which is not often because there’s a lot of arm muscle and pull that goes into it along with a Tubi/head wrap. This literally took me 15-20 minutes. I’ve try many other products from brushes to hair dryers with ceramics and ions Infused products and all of the fancy stuff to help with taming it down and make at least make it look somewhat ok. I have to say this is AMAZING! And totally worth money. The price Is great comparares to others out there or imitations and is very easy to use. 😊💕 love it!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
I purchased this product due to my friend raving about it. However after the first 15 minutes of using it on low it sparked from the main outlet plug in. Not are what the heck is going on. I contacted the Revlon company and asked questions. I am just waiting for reply. I'll update once it happens. From what I was able to see it was awesome I have thick wavy resistant hair. That takes me about 30 minutes to air dry then 30 minutes to flat iron or curl. This took about 9 to almost dry half of my head. I definitely do not recommend if its a fire hazard. Hopefully I get a replacement and it doesn't happen again.,3,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I wish I had discovered this tool years ago!! An ad kept popping up on my Facebook page for another brand, so I put it out there to a Facebook group that I'm in and I asked for opinions on the brand and tool itself. More ladies recommended this one over the $99 one that I was asking about. Took the plunge and bought it on a Friday afternoon, and it was delivered by Saturday afternoon. Used it for the first time Sunday evening and it's AMAZING. My hair is SO soft and it literally took 10 minutes from start (somewhat towel-dried hair) to finish and I have a LOT of hair (it's long, sits right at my bra strap). No more hair dryer, no more flat iron. DO use a heat protectant if you purchase it. The low setting is too low for me. I use it on high and it does get super hot.

Enjoy ladies!! It's a gamechanger!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Good temperature control and the top actually stays cool. However, everytime I use it my hair gets stuck between the tip and the brush side. It gets stuck to the point that I had to cut it. I put tape around it and will try to use it again because i don’t want to waste my money but it also takes a while to dry the hair.

Edit: I’ve been able to use it without my hair getting stuck after I put tape around the top. It is also VERY difficult to clean. The head does detach so the product/oil build up is ridiculous. My hair feels dirty by the time I’m done drying it.",1,2,B01LSUQSB0
"Amazing for my everyday routine, especially now that it has gotten cooler. Dries my long hair very fast and cuts down frizz very well. My only cons in it are it’s really loud. It’s kind of funky to actually hold with it being so large. I strictly use the low setting. I used the high a few times and it gets so hot it literally burns you and your hair. You can see the smoke as you pull it through. And you can get it close to your roots because it’s so hot. I will say after a few times of using mine in particular it started to make this high pitched squeal that I’m not super fond of. But with all that said, the pro outweighs the cons and I still love it. Completely worth the money.",4,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I’ve had my Revlon One Step Hair Dryer & Volumizer for about a year and it still works great and delivers a quick dry with a fantastic, smooth style. It is very loud and it does get hot, so you definitely need heat protectant for your hair, but you’d be using that with a flat iron anyway, so no big deal there. I just ordered a second one as a backup in case the first one dies. My only complaint is that when I clean it out, it is very difficult to clean the lint traps at the bottom of the handle as they are so thin and long. But I’m happy to deal with that for the huge amounts of time it has saved me in styling my hair! Couldn’t love this styler more! Highly recommend!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I’ve had this for a month and wanted to try it a few times before reviewing it. My hair is curly so it takes a bit of extra time than it might someone with straight hair, also leaves my hair a little frizzy but that might just be my own curly hair. But I like it. It removes the need for me to use my blow dryer and round brush in both hands, but it is pretty bulky and heavy after a while. It’s also hot and I have to watch my hand placement. All that being said though, I think it’s just a learning curve and I’m happy with it.",4,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I am flabbergasted by all the positive reviews! I have very straight smooth hair. I was really hoping this would help give it volume and a little curl, if not a little body. After giving it two tries, I am returning it. First let me say this thing is incredibly loud, much louder than my normal hair dryer. Also, it is awkward to use; it is heavy with a wide handle. My hair got caught under the plastic tip and it pulled out a chunk. It is also very hot. If your hair falls off the brush and you need to pick it back up to put it back on, it burns! Wish it would work wonders like it does for others but, it is a no for me.",2,0,B01LSUQSB0
"This drying brush is massive. It weighs more than my old hairdryer. I didn't read the dimensions. Personally it is hard for me. I need to use both hands to use it. It works well on most of my hair, but the shorter layers are not long enough for the brush. I feel like it dries my hair faster than the regular hair dryer. I do like the way my hair looks after. It feels soft, and looks shiny and healthy. The only thing that could make this better, is if it were lighter. A smaller brush head attachment might be nice as well. I would recommend this, because it does work well.",4,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I bought this “all in one” dryer thinking it would give me a voluminous blow out without the hassle. WRONG. I have medium thick, straight and long hair which typically takes me ~10-15 minutes to blow dry with a round brush (which I actually consider pretty long and tedious). So, when I saw this product, I thought my problems were solved. I was so excited; I read countless reviews and even watched tutorials and thought this was THE answer for me. Ha!!!! Quite the opposite. First and foremost, the dryer gets HOT, and fast. I had to turn it off in between sections of hair because it was burning my scalp, ears, and hands. You would think because of that ridiculous heat it would actually dry faster, but it didn’t! Y’ALL. It took me FORTY FIVE minutes to fully dry my hair. 4–5!!!! Not to mention, it had significantly less volume and style than when I just dry with a standard blow dryer and round brush. To say I’m shocked and disappointed in my results is an understatement. Unfortunately, I can’t return this piece of crap because I’ve used it, so it’s going in the trash. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY IN THIS PRODUCT. You will be sorely disappointed.",1,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I used this dryer 3 times. The first time it had a burning smell but did a great job on my hair. The second and third time it set off the fire alarm. Why did I use it a second or third time? Because I set it aside to return it, forgot To and forgot about the last time I had used it. Finally just tossed it. If you get one that doesn’t short out I suppose it could do a good job. Sadly, not my experience.",1,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I am sooo thankful for this product!!!! I have been upset for many years because I could not get my hair to grow as I would fry it right off with my straightener. Until I purchased this hair dryer! I didn't have much faith that anything could get me away from my straightener so I could finally grow my hair out but this product has blown me away! Literally lol. I have not touched my straightener since. I just wish I purchased it much earlier. It is worth any amount of money to me, if it was $1000 I would still buy! My hair has been finally growing like crazy. Not only does it straighten my hair and takes way less time than a straightener but the volume is incredible! I get compliments all the time. Love love love this product! It is also gentle enough to use on extensions.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I really loved this initially, however, it has completely destroyed my hair. I have thin hair to begin with which has become curlier over the last few years. My hair was primarily one length and now it looks like I have multiple jagged layers that have been cut into it. I didn't notice it initially but recently when I went to put my hair up I was shocked at how short some of the pieces were My hair literally just burnt off on the edges. Going back to my standard hairdryer.",1,3,B01LSUQSB0
"Ive been a hairstylist for over 6 years and after hearing coworkers of all hair types (curly, fine, thick, straight...) rave about this product I decided to finally give it a try. My hair felt like I had gotten a blow out! I didn't even try anything fancy like I would when blow drying clients. I just brushed through my hair nice and slow and was so impressed at how great it felt! This could be very damaging so a heat protector is necessary and its definitely not an everyday use kind of thing. But for special occasions or once a week blow outs I will definitely be reaching for this!",4,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Oh. My. God. I did NOT think this work work like this!!! My hair is curly. Not like wavy with some curls at the ends. Like cork screw curly. I used this on towel dried hair (not soaking, but not just damp). Y'ALL I DID NOT EVEN NEED A FLAT IRON AND I WAS FINISHED IN 20 MINUTES. I have armpit length hair, but my hair is fine, so Idk how this would be with this hair, but I'll never go back. It looks thicker, it's shiny, and soft. Can't beat it, beat 60 bucks I ever spent",4,0,B01LSUQSB0
So I would say the drying power on this thing is pretty good. I did try to use it when my hair was SOPPING wet and it took me probably twice as long as when it's towel dried. Straightening my hair takes 20ish minutes and with this thing it takes 10 to 15 minutes. It looks really nice. My hair looks sleek but not straight. It has bounce and life to it. I like my hair straight sometimes but with this item it just looks more natural. I can usually sleep after using it and not have to touch it up too much the next day. I really do love this and I'm glad I asked for it for my birthday!,5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"The first time I used this I hated it because it made my hair frizzy, not straight and beautiful. The first time I didn't put any product in my hair, I just went from shower to drying. But I decided to give it the benefit of doubt and try a second time. This time I added Hair Food Heat Protection to my wet hair and brushed in through before using the Revlon Hot Air Brush. The second time my hair came out smooth and silky and pretty straight, but not as straight as when I blow dry it with a round brush. BUT... it's super quick and since I'm working from home my hair doesn't have to be too too perfect, so I'm good with the ""somewhat straight"" hair I have today.",4,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Omg omg I'm so happy I purchased this. I have thick black Indian hair and usually, styling tools do not work on my hair as I would like them to; however, this product amazed me. It literally took me 20 minutes or less and I was able to achieve the results I had wanted. This is absolutely an honest review. Like me, there are many of you that rely on reviews of others before purchasing products and I promise you, this product will not disappoint you. Also, it is much cheaper on Amazon than other places such as Ulta (it was sold out there). Please please get this. I have never used a blow dryer because I don't have patience for that but I was able to get decent results with this product. I'm impressed Revlon!",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I absolutely LOVED this Revlon One Step Hair dryer & volumize Hot air brush!. I thought it dried my hair in no time at all. I end up having to return it, only because my hair is too short for the size of the brush. My hair is just about a 1/2 inch short of the bottom of my neck. This makes it hard to get any volume. I just need one that is just as good at drying hair but the brush is a little smaller. If there is one like that, PLEASE let me know. I would really like to buy it.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I have thick hair that takes a solid half hour to dry with a brush and standard hair dryer. Due to the texture I need nearly 10 more minutes To straighten it. First time using this product I had silky smooth hair in 15 minutes. This is the closest I’ve ever gotten to a salon-quality styling at home and it took little effort. It’s easy to use and my hair didn’t get tangled at all. I thought it felt a bit bulky at first, but it’s pretty lightweight and since it took less time to dry my hair than normal that turned out to be no big deal. My only criticism is I wish there was a medium heat setting. I used it on the high settling first and ended with cool. Low is just too low to do much with my hair. I couldn’t be happier with the results and highly recommend it.",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I have wavy, long, medium thickness, frizzy hair. I have been blow drying my hair once a week for most of my life. Even in the summer. ( with a traditional blow dryer a round brush) I have worked in high end salons in nyc for years, as a receptionist. (Not a stylist) I say that b/c I was taught how to blow dry my own hair. I have gotten pretty good at it by now. Even with learning with a professional, it was still at least 1hour process.
And then I discover this AMAZING one step dryer! I honestly couldn’t believe how well it worked.
Now the very first time I used it, I didn’t love it.. it takes a bit of practice, on how to hold it with out burning your hand. It gets very very hot! Once the section of hair is on the brush, how to hold it just right, to get to the root straight and smooth. That takes using it a few times.
But after the 3rd time I use it.. it was super easy.
It cut my blow dry time to 25-30 mins! and the end result is shinny, straight, smooth, bouncy hair... it’s exactly how I like my blowouts.. I hope this helped someone thinking about getting it! Trust me, get it! It works!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I was really skeptical about getting a dryer like this. My stylist used this exact one at my last appointment and I was sold.
I’ve only used it 3 times and all I can say is WOW!
I have thick, curly-wavy hair. I’ve never been able to master blow drying my hair with a round brush. I’ve always needed to use a straightener after.
But with this... it’s a one step process!! It has cut the time spent on my hair from 45-60 minutes down to 15-20 min. My hair has looked amazing each time so far and it lasts!
I was blessed with a lot of volume, so I was concerned it would give me too much, but I don’t think it has.
Only thing I wish is the temperature of the Cool setting would be a little cooler. Otherwise, I love everything about it!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I rarely write reviews for products, but this one certainly deserves it!! As a teacher and a mother of a 15 month old, time is precious. I have wavy hair and usually spend 45 minutes blow drying and using a flat iron to get my hair straight. My friends talked about this product and I decided to give it a try. I was skeptical at first because I have short hair.. but I am really glad I purchased this. It took me 11 minutes to get this look... ONLY 11!!! I couldn’t believe it. Not only did it make my hair smooth and silky, it also gave it nice volume that I normally can’t get with my other routine. This is like a miracle brush!! Get it, seriously.. just go and add it to your cart now! :)",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"The size isn't a problem unless you have short hair. The size actually helps get a lot more hair in the brush, which helps dry it quicker, but short hair might have a hard time really getting grabbed by the bristles. It has two heat settings. I usually use high and I can style and dry my fine/medium-long length hair within ten minutes and be out the door for work. I will say that using heat styling brushes do sometimes make your hair feel a little gunky after using them, but in my experience if it feels this way it is only because your hair is still not completely dry at the roots, meaning you need to make sure you focus enough attention near your scalp and also make sure your hair is done in parts. Other than that there's really nothing special to it and it works great! 10/10 would recommend for yourself or as a gift.",4,0,B01LSUQSB0
"Overall, this is a terrific product and does the job well. I have thick, curly hair and the drier enables me to either straighten it all the way or calm it down to be wavy without a puffy mess. A couple of things worth mentioning: I use a regular blow dryer to almost “dry” my hair all over before using this one to style. It takes less time to style then. Also, the handle is rather thick so it is a little hard to hold while using and sometimes your hand will accidentally switch the setting. The hot is HOT so be careful. I’m used to the dryer now and am enjoying it. I’m glad I got this one.",4,One,B01LSUQSB0
"Omg! Okay., first my hair is ethnic...very thick coarse and frizzy. I never use a blow dryer anymore (for over 2 years) and let my hair air dry and sleep on it so it will compact down and be easier to flat iron in the morning. WELL...I saw this and originally thought about it for my niece for Christmas to make school mornings faster for her...BUT after I read reviews and did some looking and checking I bought one for me too! I just used it for the first time tonight!!!! WHOA Amazing hair BATMAN! I was in shock honestly. It dried and flattened my hair in like 15 minutes. It’s smooth and NO FRIZZ! I am so excited for this hair tool. It’s seriously amazing. If my ethnic thick coarse hair is done in 15 minutes than HOLY FAST DRYING in 5 minutes with regular normal thickness hair types! Get it NOW! Love love love it! Pics attached...no makeup so don’t judge me....you don’t know my life HAHAHHAHA",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
Normally I air dry my hair and then straighten it the next day and that’s how I’ve done my hair for years but it’s just straight and blah. This definitely didn’t cut my dry time but it looks like I used a blow dryer and round brush so it does give it more life so I’ll take it. It is H O T! I had to leave the room a few times to cool off. But I wanted it on hot to get it done the fastest I could. I have thick wavy hair down to my mid back. Straightening my air dried hair usually takes me 30min. This also took about 30min on my first try from wet to dry!,4,One,B01LSUQSB0
"I love this so much I’ve ordered another as backup. I’ve gifted one, and I’ve told every friend about it. On towel-dried hair it takes me 7 minutes. Section off your hair and go. Silky and shiny just like the salon, but without the expense or scheduling. My hair even looks great the next day. Buy this!",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"Don’t even question yourself, sis. this blow dryer CHANGED MY LIFEEEEE. no more holding your brush in one hand and blow dryer in the other, stop & go to change your hand positions to get the right angle, shoving your blow dryer in between your legs to take a hair clip out to then continue stressing your dominant arm out that’s holding that annoying old blow dryer you been sitting on for years. what would normally take me an hour and a half (to blow dry, tame & semi style my hair) now takes me 25-30 mins.

TREAT YO SELF (it’s not even expensive, anyway.)",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I was really excited about this after reading the reviews. I have long hair and it takes forever to blow dry. I feel like this is better for people with shorter hair, not long hair. Here are my pros and cons:

Pros:
- It really does make your hair feel silky smooth. I didn't think mine it would but it did! Feels much softer than if I were to blow dry.
- Well...I guess that is the only pro I can come up with!

Cons:
- Does not shorten the amount of time to dry my hair. Maybe it is different with shorter hair but it takes the same amount of time with this brush as does my hair dryer.
- It also doesn't style my bangs well. Leaves them looking flat so I do have to get my hair dryer and circle brush out to style those. I also have to get out my straighter for certain parts of my hair, mostly around the ear area. So it kind of defeats the purpose since I still have to use both my hair dryer and my straightener.
- It also didn't ""volumize"" my hair. Maybe because I have too much hair or it's too heavy.
- The handle is WAY too bulky. By the end, my hand is cramping. It's just very awkward to hold.

I'll continue to use it since it was pretty expensive and it does leave my hair feeling soft. I wouldn't say don't buy it, just know that if you have long hair it still takes the same amount of time to dry. Just kind of bummed out that it didn't work out how I was hoping it would.",3,0,B01LSUQSB0
"This product is revolutionary. So prior to getting this as a gift, I didn’t own a hair dryer or a curling iron. Probably wouldn’t be able to efficiently use either of those anyways. I air dry my hair and it’s usually always pulled up, I might straighten it once every few months or so. Now I’ll probably use this every time I wash my hair. All I had to do was brush my hair, tooo easy. I tried to do the little curly things on the bottom, but haven’t figured that out yet. But my hair still looks amazing even when it’s used to just brush and dry.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I’m not one to write a review, but this brush has left me speechless. I have curly hair, it usually takes me 1hr to get my hair straight. 45min blow drying with brush and blower, 15min to flat iron.
I’ve tried many dryer brushes and non have been strong enough to straighten my hair on the first go, that’s why I chose to keep doing it the old fashioned way. Saw this brush at Target and been wanting to try it out, finally ordered it on amazon. And I am in LOVEEEEE, not only it reduced my drying time in half, but it does an amazing job. Left my hair looking like a salon blow, shiny, straight and with volume. My roots have always been a struggle and this brush got them done perfectly.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"This product was relatively easy to use and made styling my hair less complicated than using a separate dryer and brush. It does not dry very well so you have to wait until hair is almost fully dry. HOWEVER, after owning this product for 1 month and some days, it literally CAUGHT ON FIRE!!!! I have only used it a handful of times and this morning I plugged it in, turned it on and it caught on fire and burnt. Very disappointed.",1,2,B01LSUQSB0
"A friend of mine has been raving about this product. Skeptical, I purchased it. With previous similar brush/dryer combos, they were too heavy, not enough ""blow"", or my hair would get stuck in the brush. This is one PERFECT. Two settings for low and dry air, the cord spins along with the brush (so no tangling) and my hair does not get stuck in the brush. I will never use a regular blow dryer again!",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"This hair dryer changed my life — and saved me a lot of time. I have thick, curly (the unmanageable kind) and have spent the majority of my teen/adult years blow drying and then straightening my hair. Even with a normal blow dryer and a round brush, I could never get it to look like I just left the salon. This blow dryer changed that completely. I air dry my hair a little and then use this to blow it out and I’m done in under 15 minutes. My old process took at least an hour. Plus it makes my hair straight and bouncy just like I got it professionally done. I ordered one for my friend for Christmas. It takes some getting used to at first, knowing which way to dry the hair but you get the hang of it. The only thing, so far, is it can get a little hot. I found that using the glove that comes with other curling irons helps (of just a plain cotton winter glove).",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"This product has changed my hair routine in the best way. It works best on damp hair, so I either rough dry it bit first or I let it dry naturally for a half hour or so if I’m not in a hurry. Then the magic happens! It is quick and produces SHINY hair with lots of volume. I have fine hair, so this is something I could never achieve in my own or without a lot of product. The amount of compliments I’ve gotten since getting the revlon styler is insane and I know it works. My only criticism is that it gets too hot. I use it on the low setting and the hair still feels hot after I run the brush through. Very important to use a heat protectant.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"So I first saw ""the blowout brush"" on an Instagram ad. I'm always skeptical of IG ad's though and this is a perfect example why. They copy items like this one and then sell it for double the price or more. The one I saw advertised looked identical to this one but it was $100. I'm glad I searched amazon and came across this Revlon one. It really works as amazing as it sounds. I loved blowing out my hair with a round brush, but it took me 45 minutes and my arms would get so tired and tangled lol. This dries the hair really well and gives it great volume and flip, and takes less time. definitely recommend trying it out if you're considering because chances are you'll love it!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I bought the Revlon One Step hair dryer and volumizer and unlike other hair dryers or curling irons - this lasted less than a year with minimal use. 11 months after purchase and using it only 3 times a week, the gears started making this awful noise and then grinded to a halt. I've had hair dryers last several years and the same with flat irons and curling irons. The return window has closed, however I feel less than a year reflects a poor quality overall. I would like a new replacement.",1,2,B01LSUQSB0
"Very disappointed. It made my straight hair straighter, it did not volumize it at all. It is also very bulky and difficult to work with. I have been told by hair stylists that I blow dry my hair like a stylist, so I know what I'm doing. I have a lot of hair, though it is fine and straight. I can manage to get volume with a hair dryer and a brush quite well, and I thought this would save me time and effort. Well, no it did not. It has 2 speeds, low and high, which are very hot and bad for my hair, making it static - so it's not ionic as it claims - and it has a high cool speed, which didn't dry my hair. So a DUD for me all around and I'm sending it back. Might be good for curly hair that you want to straighten, but that's it.",1,0,B01LSUQSB0
"I love this device.....but of course Revlon had to exaggerate and call it a hair dryer, because.....Capitalism. It's an awesome tool for completing your style when your hair is about 80% dry (or completely dry, if you prefer). It's magic for adding volume and direction to bangs. It adds shine, smooths hair and add volume. Great styling tool.....but not a hair dryer Revlon.....give us some respect. (Although I guess technically you could dry your hair with this if you have 20 minutes to spare in the AM).",4,0,B01LSUQSB0
"it did not take much convincing from a friend to get me to order this. literally the best hair purchase ever. this round brush dryer is the easiest and faster thing i've ever experienced. it is larger than expected but it's gentle on my hair and the low heat setting is perfect. there's a knob on top hold to help twist the ends. i have medium length, colored hair and will never go back to my regular dryer unless i need to use the diffuser. please invest in yourself and make this purchase <3",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"A few friends recommended this to me and at first I was hesitant because they have slightly wavy hair that does not take anywhere near the time or effort I need to blow out my longish curly hair. My hair is not super thick and it normally takes me about 25 minutes from start to finish to blow out my hair. I thought I had good timing due to decades of practice, a blow dryer attachment, and a large round brush. I timed myself for my first use - 12 minutes from wet to completely dry! Very easy to use if you are used to drying your hair with two hands this simplifies things so much. You have much more control because it is all in one. I didn't think this would work as well as my more expensive hairdryer (although it is louder). I'm very impressed, I hope it holds up!",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"It was a great product while it worked. I purchased this in November and it has already stopped working.
It got a burning smell so I turned it off, let it cool and re-tried it after 10 minutes, no longer dries. Very disappointed as I really liked it when it was working.",1,5,B01LSUQSB0
"THIS IS THE BEST THING EVER!!!!!!!
LONG REVIEW:
So I have extremely long, full, dry (because of dying it blonde), heavy Dominican hair. Let’s start there lol. My mom is Dominican hair stylist. And all my life I’ve gotten my hair done by her (Yes, I’m blessed with that). But because of that, I never learned to pretty much do my hair. I just know the basic stuff. But blow drying it. For the life of me, I can’t. And every time I’ve tried, which I can count with one hand how many times I’ve done it. I would last around 4 to 5 hours doing it, I’m not kidding. Again, I have a lot of hair.
But this product has CHANGED MY LIFE!!! For the first time ever I was able to do my hair!!! And I did it. In probably 2 hours. It could of been less. But I wanted to make sure. It was the straightest it could be. I don’t live close to my mom anymore, so I did not have the chance to straighten my hair that often. And left it curly for months. Which with a bleached hair because of the blonde. Was not healthy at all. And it just dried my hair so much!

This product left my hair so smooth, dried it so quick, and left it straight how my hair used to be. My hair was still very dry, but it was not because of this product. But because of how damaged my hair is now. I would buy this over and over again. And has changed my hair care for life!

Also, I have recommended it to so many people. And they all have bought it. And are completely in love with it too. Definitely recommend for you to buy it.",5,0,B01LSUQSB0
"El cepillo supero mis espectativas, tengo el cabello afro textura 4c , desrrizado químicamente , las nuevas raíces eran mi preocupación , si el cepillo podía lacearlas o no ? Mi respuesta es Si , deifinitivamete el cepillo llega a la raíz y deja todo mi pelo hermoso , lo use en temperatura media , el único problema no sé si es falta de práctica es que mi pelo corto por el hombro , se me dificulta darle vueltas , entonces el peinado me quedo totalmente recto , supongo que para pelo largo esto no es un problema.",5,One,B01LSUQSB0
"It didn’t dry my hair as well as I wanted it to, which was fine because I don’t have the skill to use a round brush and a blow dryer at the same time. This dryer doesn’t have much variety as far as settings and temperature control are concerned. The main problem I had after a while was that when I first turned on the dryer on the low setting, it would start to uncontrollably blast and start smelling like smoke. This “low setting” was now much higher than the highest setting on the dryer. I have no choice but to declare this hairdryer a fire hazard and now I am looking for options for a new one because I’m not sure if I trust buying the same one again. I’m guessing that in order to cut corners, Revlon decided to opt out of having a QA department for this particular product.",2,0,B01LSUQSB0
"This is the most perfect tasting mint toothpaste to my buds; not too sweet or bitter. It does an excellent job at keeping my mouth feeling clean all day and has also noticeably improved the brightness of my teeth. It is great for use in conjunction with Crest's 3D Whitening Strips as it enhances and maintains any whitening effects. Love that the cap is a fuss-free mechanism as well -- it requires no twisting. I recommend the 2 pk 3.5 oz version of this product for travel as the size is more convenient. My only wish is that this toothpaste was SLS free, but hey, sometimes you just can't have it all. Looking forward to purchasing this product again when it runs out. GREAT stuff.",5,135,B01KZOTRG8
"I am a heavy coffee and tea drinker so I find myself using white strips periodically to take off surface stains, maybe once or twice a year. I noticed that I can go longer between whitening while using this toothpaste- that’s a big win. Does it totally replace strips? No. But it does work noticeably better than other toothpastes.",5,169,B01KZOTRG8
The label on the tube is obviously a copycat label. The colors are slightly off. I compared my store bought tube with this one. NOT CREST!,1,104,B01KZOTRG8
"I've been buying this toothpaste for a while now and continue to be impressed. It has always been my favorite, although I have tried the crest diamond white.toothpaste also, which I also love. This one is usually cheaper and this deal was cheaper than any Walmart deal. So I got a pack of 3 for a great price. Love this toothpaste! It keeps my teeth white, what more could a girl ask for!",5,126,B01KZOTRG8
"I used to never ever brush my teeth. I know how gross that sounds, but I started taking better care of myself-- but I had years of stains. I've barely used this toothpaste (for not even a week) and it's absolutely amazing. My teeth are noticably whiter and to top it off, my teeth don't hurt! The best toothpaste I've ever had.",,160,B01KZOTRG8
"My husband bought 1 tube @Walmart in the past. He expressed enjoyment. I grabbed a great Amazon deal buying a 3 pack. The flavor is a definite “radiant mint.” It’s toothpaste so in general I’d say it does what it’s intended to. I don’t have much to write re: “3D White” In my opinion these “whitening” toothpastes can’t resolve years worth of “natural” staining from any source, which forms on our teeth. I’ve tried them myself over the years. For what it’s worth this week my husband asked me to order a brand he used in the past. I don’t think I’ll order this again. I’m going with an overall 4 stars. It may become your favorite!",4,69,B01KZOTRG8
The cap does not close and the toothpaste is thick and difficult to dispense. No noticeable difference in the whiteness of my teeth compared to their normal products.,1,82,B01KZOTRG8

"I believe this is a replica and not original, this seller should not be allowed to sell on Amazon.",1,22,B01KZOTRG8
All 3 of the toothpaste products had been opened. Clearly it was used and as a toothpaste that is very unsanitary. Please be cautious.,3,20,B01KZOTRG8
There’s nothing offensive about this toothpaste but it’s just not great. It doesn’t give that incredibly clean mouth feeling that some do and I haven’t noticed any considerable whitening despite crest’s claims. Nothing terrible but I recommend Aquafresh or Arm & Hammer,3,24,B01KZOTRG8
I was sent a fake. DO NOT PURCHASE.,1,18,B01KZOTRG8
"DIRECTLY compared my current Crest 3d White in Radiant Mint that was bought from the store, the amazon product tastes TERRIBLE like a chemical of some sort. I have been using this toothpaste for years having bought them from the store, this one is FAKE. DO NOT PURCHASE.",1,11,B01KZOTRG8
"I get a lot of compliments on my teeth. My secret? Crest whitening strips and toothpaste! In the beginning of my whitening journey, I found myself using the strips maybe 2-3 times a week. Once I was happy with how my teeth look, I just used this toothpaste daily and nothing else. Now I periodically use the whitening strips 1-2 times per month to touch up and I have no problem with my teeth staining from coffee or soda. Haven’t used any other toothpaste in years! This toothpaste might not get the whitening done on its own, but it does a fantastic job of maintaining the whitening effects! Have fun whitening!",5,6,B01KZOTRG8
Fake garbage. I immediately knee something was wrong when the toothpaste was way too liquidy coming out of the tube. It didn't taste anything like the previous tubes I've received and upon further inspection the tube has several defects from low quality manufacturing that aren't on the previous tabs. The lot/exp date is also in a different spot that usual. I'm returning all 9 tubes and ordering a different brand.,1,7,B01KZOTRG8
"Good price and I dont have to go to Target. Works As advertised. It's toothpaste so it's mostly preference and now you know mine, dammet. Anyway I used to use this brand another flava but my girls teeth are so white and purdy I made the switch. Her mom says she ""white strips"" like it's dirty so it must be working.",5,10,B01KZOTRG8
This is the second time that I order the first one was super good but now they send me a different one and it doesn’t taste like the real one,1,9,B01KZOTRG8
"Made a huge difference in my teeth. I was embarrassed to smile and have some confidence back. I am going to do another one as soon as possible! The crest site says you can use 2 back-to-back so that is my plan. My mom also used one and got great results. Great product, no bad taste. No sensitivity at all and dramatic results after only a few days. These pics were taken in the exact same lighting conditions with no filters after only 2 weeks of treatment so the final result was even better! Professional whitening would have produced the same results but for $450 so these are definitely worth it!",5,5,B01KZOTRG8
"As a Dental Professional, Crest 3D Radiant Mint is the only toothpaste I use. With these three individuals tubes, you get a great price for a bundle of three. Yes, there are two label colors out there because Crest has changed their coloring to look for modern. The more pink labeling is the new label compared to the solid blue you might see. This tooth is the real thing & coming from the manufacture, it contains Sodium Fluoride which is great for strengthening the enamel you already have. The mint flavor is NOT overpowering and its delightfully fresh & not sandy. It's refreshing and worth it! I'm glad this is a value for your money.",5,3,B01KZOTRG8
"I saw some reviews saying it is a knock off and not the same because it is now in a different package. Yes it does look different, but you are also getting a smaller amount. Maybe the packaging changed because they are giving you a smaller amount or they can be packaged differently now for Amazon. I know Amazon does sell items from manufacturers in different packaging, and it is sometimes labeled ""for online"". I noticed it with kitty litter I ordered. It was suppose to be exactly like the one I would purchase at the supermarket. Was it like the one in the supermarket, no, so I stopped purchasing it on Amazon. I have no idea if the toothpaste is fake, but it does work. I saw results in one week. I use it at night and sensodyne in the morning. Before I used sendodyne, twice a day. As for the lot number and expiration date, it is written in white, on the red block, on the back. My toothpaste has ""0146"" for lot number, and ""MR23"" for the expiration date.",4,0,B01KZOTRG8
FAKE COPYCAT. Box looks very similar but tube is very different than Crest 3D White. Also no lot # or exp date on the back which confirms that is not a P&G product. Do not buy.,1,6,B01KZOTRG8
"Finally I found a toothpaste that advertised as foaming that actually DID FOAM! I had tried about 3 other brands that claimed to be foaming toothpastes, and none of them foamed in the least. I use a Sonicare toothbrush (purchased from Amazon, of course). Regular toothpastes are really heavy and don’t work as well as I’d like with the Sonicare. I end up having more clumps of regular, thick toothpaste (TP) in my sink than in my mouth. Not with the Crest 3D White. It foams beautifully, and my teeth feel squeaky clean after brushing. I’m sold on it. And it’s a great price, especially as compared to some of the newer foaming TP products which have much less volume. I have a problem with how some TPs taste. Some of them are so strong that I can almost gag on them. (This is a new development in my aging experience.) The Crest product isn’t pleasant tasting to me (no TP is at my age), but it is the most tolerable of any others I’ve used since my TP taste buds have changed so much. I also used to have to go to get my teeth cleaned every 6 months. I have a very dry mouth from rheumatoid Arthritis. This TP has kept my teeth from staining!! I have not seen a dental hygienist in over a year! (I should, but I have to find one first because I moved from California to Wisconsin. ). I’m sticking with this product!",,One,B01KZOTRG8
"I love Crest 3D toothpaste and highly recommend it. HOWEVER, the product I received from Amazon must be a fake or knockoff because it has an absolutely horrid chemical smell. Nothing like the real toothpaste bought in stores. Don't buy this from Amazon.",1,6,B01KZOTRG8
This is a COUNTERFEIT PRODUCT. don’t buy.,1,7,B01KZOTRG8
"This is my go-to toothpaste. It has a really nice and fresh mint flavor, and it seems to combat the stains from my daily coffee addiction. However, I have found that my teeth are a lot more sensitive after exclusively using this toothpaste for months. If you already have sensitive teeth, the whitening additives might be a little too much for you.",3,2,B01KZOTRG8
I like the white paste I hated this blue one. I feel it doesn't clean as well as the white past does. The paste I like is also Crest its the same whitening except the paste is white. Will not be purchasing again. The usual toothpaste that I use was out of stock hence I took my chance on this one.,2,2,B01KZOTRG8
"I love all of the Crest 3D products. I use the Whitestrips as well, but with this toothpaste you don't have to use the strips nearly as often. I drink coffee and red wine, and my teeth stay very white with these products.",5,6,B01KZOTRG8
I love this toothpaste so much I know when it’s not the real deal. This unfortunately arrived expired and in a different tube than it comes in at the store. Also woke up feeling like I didn’t brush my teeth last night (I did ) sufficiently grossed out,1,6,B01KZOTRG8
It was a fake. I’ve been buying this for the past ~ 5 years and this product design and taste is very different.,1,7,B01KZOTRG8
"I’m an avid coffee drinker and my teeth were looking a little yellow. After two days of use, I saw a difference. After three days, I saw a noticeable difference. I really scrubbed my teeth good, but man does it work.

My teeth are so bright now, I may consider being a plus size bald male model. Hey, it could happen.",5,3,B01KZOTRG8
"I honestly was skeptical on whether or not this product would do any “whitening”. I usually use regular crest gel toothpaste meant to prevent cavities, but I decided to try something different. I was amazed to see that after about 4 days of use my teeth were a bit whiter than before. Will continue to use this product to maintain it. A word of caution though for those who can’t handle mint or the “spiciness” of it, this is very minty, like 10x more than the average toothpaste. I don’t mind it though, in fact, I feel that it make my teeth more fresh.",5,One,B01KZOTRG8
"I bought this thinking it was the ""3D White Brilliance"" (so many products with almost the same name). Make sure you like to flavor before you buy. To me, this tastes exactly like the local numbing agent they use at the dentist before they use the novacain needle. (I have very negative associations with this flavor which make this toothpaste a no-way for me... I'll be donating the two unopened tubes.)",1,3,B01KZOTRG8
"Used this product for a long time and it works great, only problem is it causes gum, lips, and cheek tissue to slough off while you sleep so you have this layer of dead mouth tissue in your mouth when you wake up.

Our dentist says it’s a very common allergic reaction people are having to the gel toothpastes and recommended we switch to Colgate toothPASTE; we did and have had no more issues.

It sucks because we had just bought this 3 pack and still have 2 tubes left, but oh well.

It works and tastes great, but if you have this reaction, stop using it.",3,0,B01KZOTRG8
"I like everything about the product it performs as expected; after all it is toothpaste; how exciting can it possibly be. the attraction was the price and the packaging. I'm of the sort that likes to have extra everything; nothing worse than running out of toothpaste or any other staple you need daily. So I make my purchases in bulk and when I get down to the last of something it gives me a fair amount of time to replenish. Never know when someone may come over and need a toothbrush, paste or any other toiletry so you can give it to them w/o impacting what you have for yourself. Anyway I'll purchase more I still have two tubes and only half way through the first. .",5,0,B01KZOTRG8
I have been using this toothpaste for many many years and absolutely love it. I normally was buying this at Walmart for around 5 dollars for one but getting 3 for $9.99 is a fantastic deal. Used correctly this toothpaste will whiten and brighten you teeth. The mint taste isn't over powering and doesn't burn your mouth. I couldn't recommend it enough. Just try it and you will love it.,5,3,B01KZOTRG8
"While shopping on line for some toothpaste I came across this brand (Crest 3D white toothpaste, radiant mint, 3 value pack of 4 oz. tubes) on Amazon for a bargain price. I was impressed with the very quick delivery time and received the package in one day. I also like the minty taste of this Crest white toothpaste.

If you need toothpaste you may want to check out this 3 value pack of Crest Toothpaste.

"This is supposed to be 'toothpaste', not gel, and yet that is what if feels like when applying to my toothbrush and cleaning my teeth. It is not what I was expecting at all and the worst of it is, I got the 3 box set....so now, I guess I'm stuck with it. Crest, how about a basic toothpaste that is actually that and not a gel!",2,2,B01KZOTRG8

But that is not my go-to toothpaste because of the weird feeling in my mouth right after I finished brush my teeth, which I have never experienced with other toothpastes.

I will not buy it again anyway.",3,0,B01KZOTRG8

Good product but just doesn't work for me.",3,0,B01KZOTRG8
Do not use unless you want super sensitive teeth. Used it for a week and stopped after developed a sensitivity to water below room temp. 2 months later the sensitivity has decreased. didn't see any major change in that time. Not messing with whitening tooth paste again.,1,3,B01KZOTRG8

"I have been using this brand for about 4 years now, it does work, I used to make sure I alternated between this and a Cgate total care toothpaste or something safe for the enamel but haven't in a while.

"This toothpaste is enough I guess to clean your teeth (I'm not a dentist, so no guarantees), but it just doesn't keep breath fresh.

I don't have this problem with other toothpaste, just this one.",3,0,B01KZOTRG8
"This toothpaste does seem to whiten the teeth and has a very pleasant taste. I have downgraded it because the tube is so poorly designed. I have to constantly squeeze the product to the top, but my biggest complaint is the opening to dispense the toothpaste. It is impossible to spread a dollop on the brush without leaving a good portion of toothpaste around the opening. It has to be wiped off and still forms a crust. I estimate that 25% of of the product is lost to this flaw.",2,0,B01KZOTRG8

"Twenty years ago I had $400 professional tooth whitening by an excellent dentist in San Diego. My teeth didn't look any whiter (the dentist was embarrassed), and because of the cost and potential damage to enamel from repeated whitening sessions, I'll never have this done by a dentist again. Out of five varieties of 3 brands of whitening toothpastes I've tried, Crest 3D White is the only one that makes my teeth look a little whiter. I still alternate 3D white with non-whitening toothpastes to minimize harsh chemical effects that add up over a lifetime.

If you drink coffee or tea and really want to keep your teeth white, swish plain water through your teeth 2 or 3 times immediately after EVERY cup. It sounds like overkill, but you'll see how much stain you're preventing if you spit into a white mug afterwards. Because coffee is mildly acidic, wait awhile before brushing your teeth. Brushing immediately after drinking coffee is slightly harder on the enamel because trace acidity may still be on the tooth surface.",5,4,B01KZOTRG8
"I was super skeptical, read the reviews, and I have to say that after one week of using this product according to directions (twice daily for 2 minutes) that it works to whiten teeth! Now, they aren't Chicklet white, blinding white, which is fine. It's not a drastic difference, but my teeth are noticeably whiter and brighter than before. I recently had a professional cleaning and was considering the Whitestrips, which I've never used. After reading reviews and asking around, I decided I didn't want to deal with the side effect of sensitive teeth and give this a try. I will offer one point of caution...if you are a scrubber, as I am, and tend to brush hard and fast...don't. You will tear up your gums (as I suspect several of the low star ratings folks have experienced)! Lesson learned on day one. Finding that I must brush 4 minutes total a day with this product, I am diligent about brushing better, not harder. So, a bad habit is being broken, which is a good thing. My teeth have lost their mild yellowish cast and look bright, which is a good thing. They feel clean and look great, the product seems to work. My only question is this...is it the product or the fact that I am spending more quality time brushing and caring for my teeth that before that is making the difference? Could I get the same results by applying this routine with any ordinary toothpaste or baking soda? Well, I plan to continue with this product until it runs out, then I guess I will find out. Oh, also, I used my kids Firefly toothbrush timer light to time my brushing. That works fantastic. Push the button and go.",3,2,B01KZOTRG8
"Fake. Not real Crest toothpaste. It even smells strange. What is going on?!?! This is ridiculous, Amazon.",1,7,B01KZOTRG8
"For the price, this is a bargain, as these three tubes will last over 90 days. The feel is clean in your mouth and on your teeth. The whitening action is very subtle and not abrasive. After a month, you will maintain a whiter smile and fresh breath without feeling dry. This is one of those products that I buy over and over again when I run out.",,11,B01KZOTRG8

This doesn't have a strong mint taste so you don't feel as fresh as you normally do with other toothpaste. I feel like my teeth are whiter from using only this.

"I'm a hairy gal. Hormonal problems ruled out by my physician, it's just hereditary. My cheeks, neck, forehead, and chin are covered in a fine ever-growing peach-fuzz. If I cease shaving, I shall acquire a boat and thus forth be dubbed blonde beard. My mustache is darker and thicker, something I think a lot of women experience.

I have been shaving for a while with a men's razor (Gillette Fusion ProGlide for reference) and shaving cream but it just couldn't give me a close enough shave. ENTER SCHICK SILK TOUCH-UP! Holy Wow! I've been dry shaving my entire face and some of my neck with these and no irritation plus it is the closest shave I have gotten. No pulling or scraping like other ""mini-razors"". It's quicker than doing what I call a ""dad shave"" in the shower and I can see what I'm shaving because I'm at my makeup table and there's no shaving cream obstructing my view (I don't want to accidentally hack off the hair by my ears or forehead). Plus, I compared this to other (what I call) mini-razors and it's twice the size (picture for reference, the pink one furthest to the right is this product)!! Obviously I'm not new to the hair removal game. So very efficient for doing your whole face, easy for detailing those brows. There was a bit of skin buildup after scraping (it's called exfoliating, it's good for you because...it is) at my face but just wash off with soap and water and let air dry completely before you put a cap back on. I like to use a toner and moisturizer after shaving because I think that's what you should do after exfoliating.

At the end of the day, everyone's skin is very different. While I experienced no irritation, some reviewers suggest that using these wet or with cream works better. So you should probably patch test to see what works for your skin and don't scream at me if this doesn't solve your problems, make you rich, and give you puppies.

I love this product and hope that they sell it forever. It works on my peach fuzz, mustache, and brows. If I ever get word that they are going to stop making them, I will hoard them all.",5,"1,314",B0787GLBMV
"I'm a redhead with pale skin and light see thru hair on my arms and face. I'm a makeup artist and kept hearing from others about face shaving (dermaplanning) how it makes the makeup look better and skin glowy and decided why not, let's try it! And I'm so impressed! I wish I had a picture as I was using the tool how much white peach fuzz came off in small strokes! I loved the eyebrow tool, couldn't have shaped the brow without it! Its important to properly cleanse before using as you will be opening up your pores in the process for exfoliating, some of the reviews said they broke out and I imagine its bc they didnt properly cleanse. I washed my face and patted dry then used the product and rinsed with cold water and washed my hands with antibacterial soap. Then applied toner, serum and a high quality moisturizer. From research, they rec. Not wearing makeup the day you use this and gently cleanse and moisturize. So thats what I did! I dipped the blade in rubbing alcohol to sanitize after using. I don't know how some reviews said they cut theirselves with this tool, I was nervous to try this bc of said reviews but honestly no. Hold the tool at a 45 degree angle, make small strokes downward and hold the skin taut on the area you are doing. There's not way your going to draw blood. Good luck and give it a try!",5,"1,415",B0787GLBMV
"Super easy and satisfying to use, you’re literally scraping all of the peach fuzz and dead skin off your face.

Highly recommend.",5,653,B0787GLBMV
I regularly used the *tinkle* brand facial razors which I thought worked well but I just used one of these razors for the first time yesterday and OMG the amount of peach fuzz and to my surprise dead skin that came off was shocking and oh so satisfying. Will definitely be stocking up.,5,676,B0787GLBMV
"Love these. As I got older I noticed the thick peach fuzz. I hated it! I hesitated to use this product worried that the hair would come in coarse, but I was wrong. My aesthetician assured me that fine hair like peach fuzz would only grow back as fine hair...the very same. I did my research over the internet and the info was the same. Now I can say that I happily use it and have a smooth, peach-fuzz free face. And the best news is that the hair takes many, many weeks to grow back.",5,506,B0787GLBMV
"I've been using tinkle blades for several months but decided to try out this sponsored blade due to the many positive reviews. The Schick has been a huge disappointment. The blades were irregular at the top, leading to small scratches on my face no matter what angle I used. Also, the blades were somehow rougher on my skin while doing an inferior job at shaving the hair close. I gave up after trying the second blade. Will be returning to the tinkle.",1,299,B0787GLBMV
"I decided to give these ""new"" Schick Exfoliating razors a try VS the ""other routinely touted"" ladies face shaver brand and am so far impressed.
Why I really like them:
First off the Schick name pretty much sums it up for blade quality; although any of the other ""major"" brand names would to
The blades have tiny ""guards"" on them so you don't end up giving yourself a whole new face the hard way! [i.e. you don't end up looking like your husband with tiny bits of toilet paper stuck to your face]
This is basically a 2 in 1 razor! The blades are a good length for using on the face PLUS you can shape your brows with them....see below....

Hats off to whomever came up with the ingenious ""brow attachment cover"" ! It makes brow shaping both easy & safe! I've nicked my eye lids more than a few times using similar razors that did not have this type of attachment to cover the blades. This feature is much appreciated!

So for now I do highly recommend these! NOTE: some reviewers have given this product only one or two stars due to difficulty in using the long blade on your brow area. If you try these razors, do notice the INCLUDED BROW ATTACHMENT located on package front just below logo and its instructions on the reverse of the package!",,446,B0787GLBMV
"I bought these blades to try at home dermaplaning. I was nervous at first, but it’s almost impossible to cut yourself with these and it took the peach fuzz right off my face. In fact, as I was staring at my face in a magnifying mirror and removing the fuzz, I noticed my nose hair was a little out of control. I even used one of these in my nose (that’s right) and it worked great! I will be keeping a few of these on-hand at all times.",5,227,B0787GLBMV
"OMG -- you should see the cut on my cheek .... I was carefully defuzzing my face --- in fact I didnt even feel that I had some how the edge of the blade had cut my cheek. Sad and tragic; I will have this scar for a number of months as it heals. -- of course I'm giving up on this product and will use a safety razor, avoiding my chances of open wounds on my face",1,107,B0787GLBMV
"I have extremely dry skin on my face, specifically on my forehead, nose and cheeks. My skin in the winter flakes horribly and traditional exfoliants (including mechanical brushes) were not helping at all. My liquid foundation looked terrible, my clean skin looked dull— I needed help. I found out about dermaplaning after some google searches and did my due dilligence. I have blonde baby hairs so I cared less about the hair removal and more about the exfoliation these dermaplaning tools provided.

I followed all the instructions online folk’s recommended: wash and pat dry your face, hold skin taught, and then gently in short strokes sweep the blade across your skin. That had to be the most satisfying thing I’ve ever done in my life... dead skin flakes and baby hair came off with very little pressure. My whole face took about 30 minutes.

My skin was obviously red for several hours, as to be expected from such an intense exfoliation, but it cleared back to normal and my skin looked vibrant and flake free. I was amazed! My face is so smooth and hairless as an added bonus. This is a dry skin persons dream!

UPDATE 6/6/19: I have been using this product for several months now. I have found that I can use the same blade about three or four times before it gets too dull to use. I also found that after that first time dermaplaning, I was never that red and irritated again. I had to do it once a week in the winter, followed by a heavy moisturizer. Now that it’s summer I can do it once every few weeks, or even just “spot treat” my face where I have dry patches. Still loving it!",5,86,B0787GLBMV
I Love 💕 these little razors for all that peach 🍑 fuzz. My face looks so smooth now!!! They’re really easy to use. I had no idea there was such a product! My esthetician used something similar on my face and I thought 💭 I can do that!! So glad I found it!,5,172,B0787GLBMV
I attached a photo so you can see how smooth my skin looks and it is very smooth after I use this product. It works amazingly well on eyebrows.. I don't think I will use tweezers again! My problem is if you go over your face within a day you have prickly stubble. I was not expecting that. I am almost scared to use it again on my face. But they are easy to use and if you don't mind repeating the process it does take all the peach fuzz off.,4,107,B0787GLBMV
These little guys work perfectly for dermoplaning! I used one the other night after I washed and applied toner to my face. It’s been a couple days and my skin still feels baby soft. I didn’t have any sort of reaction or anything to the exfoliation which was nice because I have severe cystic acne. My makeup goes on so smooth and i finally have that glowing look I’ve been trying to get! I will definitely be buying these again.,5,120,B0787GLBMV
"I used to pay a professional to derma plane my face once/month to remove the peach fuzz, which makes me look older and makes the makeup application more cumbersome. I searched for years for a home product to use to save money and time, and have tried Shisheido blades and several electric face trimmers, and even those phony electrolysis gadgets, all of which were more expensive, but not near as effective. This is the closest I have been able to get to professional derma planing in the convenience of my home, on my time/schedule, and at a fraction of the price. Love it!",5,64,B0787GLBMV
"Only works on course hair. The exfoliating they talk about is from brutally scraping your skin to try to get the fine hairs, unsuccessfully.",1,78,B0787GLBMV
Holy crap! Who knew I had so much facial hair! Ok.....peach fuzz to be fair but what I got as and eyebrow shaping tool turned into a great all over face tool. It’s fairly easy to use and I didn’t peel my first layer of skin off as I imagined I would. Take your time get the angle right and you’ll be looking great in no time. Also worked great on the eyebrows but the guard makes it hard to see. Highly recommended and a great new tool for us ladies!,5,70,B0787GLBMV
"Ill be honest if you are getting these for facial hair, its cheaper and more efficient to get a pack of double blade disposable razors from the store. These are great for small areas like your eyebrows where bigger razors cant get in and do the job but for the face....its a single blade, dulls very quickly, and I found it still didn't get the hairs without going over and over them, and thats why the double blade razors will do a much better job and yes, will leave your face even smoother.",3,60,B0787GLBMV
They are okay. Not as great as the other brands that have more protection on them. These will cut u up if you’re not careful. I didn’t even notice i was cutting myself (it didn’t bleed) but an hour later had scratch marks all over.,3,66,B0787GLBMV
I like the product and use it to remove the top layer of dead skin cells and touch up my facial hair. It works well but if not used correctly you can knick yourself or cause irritation. My skin feels smooth after each use. I don’t recommend using this multiple times a piece unless you properly wipe and sterilize the blade after each use. It does build up gunk and can transfer bacteria back.,4,56,B0787GLBMV
"Wow. My first ever. I just love shaping my eyebrows with these. Even shaves the dead skin off my skin. I can also use it to shave the hairs on my arm, hahaha. The little sideburns hairs that give me breakouts are wiped out! This feels like a great quality product that will last me for a few years, if I don’t get them rusty.",5,47,B0787GLBMV
"I’ve tried many different eyebrow/facial razors before. Hands down this is the best brand I have ever used. I love how it comes with an extra piece to go over the razor, When trimming/Cleaning up your eyebrows! I highly reccomened",5,50,B0787GLBMV
"I bought one of those fancy hair removers that look like lipstick 🙄 This is awesome! I don’t use it for my eyebrows, but it looked like fur coming off my face and now it’s SO smooth ☺️",5,50,B0787GLBMV
If you want these for dermaplaning keep looking. The razor is not a straight edge but is jagged and ended up leaving my face raw and burning. My skin was anything but smooth on the following days. My face actually formed scab like flaky skin that didn't go away for about 5 days. My makeup looked horrible on top of the flaky skin. Ive gotten dermaplaning professionally done before and had a completely different experience. I followed the directions and also watched videos of professional dermaplaning being done so I do not think that it was error on my part. Disappointed but I guess you get what you pay for.,1,38,B0787GLBMV
"The word ""razor"" is misleading. It isn't one. This is useful if you want to scrape and tear the stray hairs from your brows, but it sure as heck wasn't precision. Or painless. It was like scraping a tiny, bumpy butter knife over your face. Definitely not as useful as the real straight razors I've used. Next.",1,39,B0787GLBMV
"I bought these, then didn't use them for months because I was terrified I would end up with stubble or razor burn and be horribly embarrassed. I can't believe I was ever afraid, because there is NO going back, now! I will share with perfect strangers on the street how wonderful it is to have a clean-shaved face!

I had an electric trimmer for my upper lip and chin, and it was fine, but it never got as close as I thought it could and it was no good on my cheeks/jaw, plus batteries were inconvenient. I finally got brave enough to use these razors and WOW! My skin is so smooth, not only because all the fuzz is gone (and there was a disturbing amount of fuzz), but it scrapes off LOADS of dead skin, too. It's INCREDIBLE. Smoother than silk. You won't believe it! I would let you touch my face if you were here right now. You would be impressed, I promise.

I use the blade on clean DRY skin - no lotions, oils or moisturizers, I ""dermaplane""/""shave"" right out of the shower once my face is completely dry. I hold the blade pretty much perpendicular to my skin - if it's at an angle, it doesn't shave as close. I use rapid, short strokes all over my cheeks, jaw, neck, upper lip, chin, and between and above my eyebrows to remove all the offending fuzz. I was pretty nervous to do my ""sideburns"", but I've been shaving up to about my ""ear hole"" and I think it looks pretty natural. :-) No one's said anything yet, anyway. Haha!

I do my whole face once a week, then apply a moisturizer. Each razor lasts about 4 uses, then become noticeably dull and doesn't remove the little fine hairs as well.

Previously, when I'd apply lipstick at stoplights I'd see my mustache and not think much of it, but the first time I folded down my mirror to check my look after using this razor, I laughed out loud at what a complete and utter lack of hair was on my face. It was shocking that I lived so long with so much fuzz on my face and how fast and easy it was to get it gone! I'm a big time believer! You should try it, too!!",5,18,B0787GLBMV
Blade was uneven and therefore scratched up my face! I have used Tinkle razors before and did not experience my skin peeling off. Do not recommend!,1,33,B0787GLBMV
If I could give 0 stars I would. I was very excited to use this product to remove hair from my upper lip that I’ve been battling for years. Unfortunately I was left disappointed because it did not remove any hair and left red marks behind. I used as suggested but it didn’t work. Don’t waste your money.,1,31,B0787GLBMV
"Kinda disappointed

I’m a new leaner for shaping and shaving eyebrow. I saw recommendation for Kai and Shishido razor by youtuber/make up artist but I’m in urgent to find a razor so I chose this prime item that can be delivered to me in one day.

I felt like it’s hard to get rid of my hair on eyelid even tho I tried many angles (but I admit I’m a new learner for doing eyebrow so I don’t dare to put too much effort, I’m kinda careful). Also I felt like smaller blade could help too. If you don’t need to shave large area of hair and just need to tweak your eyebrow in small area I don’t recommend this.

Right now I’m gonna order Kai (Beiyin) and shiedo and will update my review after I got those ones.",1,20,B0787GLBMV
"I bought these razors instead of the normal ones that I have used for years due to the good reviews as well as the larger brand name. These razors were pretty awful. They did not give a clean shave (cut? Trim? I'm not sure what to call it when it is your eyebrows!) and were fairly irritating on the skin. I can easily feel stubble where I used it. They include a guard that is supposed to limit the size of the razor for a more detailed shave, but it does not work at all. It is too thick and exposed part of the razor can not reach the skin. Also, the guard fits so poorly on the razor it was a bit hard to get on, and then when I tried to remove it, it was so difficult to get off, that I accidently cut my thumb pretty badly when it popped off. I'll take some credit for the cut, as I should have either grabbed a rag to put over it and pull it off, or just given up and thrown it away and just grabbed another razor from the pack. I do place some credit on Schick for creating an ill fitting and useless guard though. I have never had this issue with the other brand I use. I threw away the rest of the razors and will be purchasing from the other brand again.",1,21,B0787GLBMV
"Okay, I have very dry sensitive skin. exacerbated by the use of Retin-A. I have had facials with derma planing, and bought this as a lark. I was concerned by some of the few reviewers who complained about this hacking up their face or some other awful result. Anyway, they arrived, and I used it on DRY skin. No shaving cream, no water, just dry, dry, dry skin. I also used it very gently, and in downward strokes avoiding the eyes, nose or mouth (though I did my upper lip and the strays around my eyebrows) and obviously not sawing back and forth or slashing motions. Just light, same-direction strokes. Used gently, it took off an entire (thin!) layer of dead skin, peach fuzz and who knows what off my face, and it was AWESOME. My skin is glowing, smooth, peach fuzz free and I know any product I'm using will soak in better, too. Highly recommend, will make a part of my regular beauty routine. I would not suggest using this more than once a week or even once a month if you have sensitive skin, but it is WAY BETTER and WAY LESS TRAUMATIC than scrubbing, using a rough wash cloth, or exfoliators on your skin. This is gentle, no muss, no fuss. A+++",5,9,B0787GLBMV
"The first time I used this I didn't realize how sharp these razors were. I did experience some redness and one or two small cuts near my ears. Very minor. But with practice comes perfection. I've had dermaplaning done at my esthetician before and I love it but it is expensive and I'd rather have microdermabrasion done every month and do my own dermaplaning at home to get rid of the peach fuzz and dead skin. I highly recommend you don't exfoliate or do anything harsh the areas you used the razor on your skin for 24 hours because it will be a little dry and raw. I would definitely recommend a hydrating mask after this. But once you get the hang of this, it really is fantastic! I've tried that Finishing Touch thing you see on tv for facial hair.. that's great for hair above the lips but everywhere else? No way. It doesn't leave your skin smooth. Just the opposite. It leaves you skin prickly. But with these razors you can literally feel the difference on your skin after you do it. No hair and so soft. Don't be frightened by the redness. It's temporary. But be gentle and don't use a heavy hand... remember these ARE razors you are still dealing with. But for ""drugstore"" razors, you get what you pay for as they say and I'd say these go above and beyond what you pay for! :)",4,11,B0787GLBMV
"These are my new favorites. They are really helpful for removing that fine facial peach fuzz. Also does great exfoliating double duty. My face has never felt smoother, and the hair does not grow back darker or thicker, contrary to popular belief. Side note: when they start getting dull, they work amazing as sweater shavers if you ever experience pilling!",5,16,B0787GLBMV
These actually work but they don’t have directions or tell you how to take care of them and clean them. It does get rid of my peach fuzz on my face and I can see it coming off which was satisfying. Also it’s very safe and fool proof because I haven’t accidentally cut myself or get nixed or razor burn. I was very worried about that but if it didn’t happen to me I doubt it would happen to anyone else because I’m that person that always gets cuts and stuff.,4,14,B0787GLBMV
"I had been using my Schick Hydro 5 on my face every other month, or so, for years. Do I have a beard? No-but a natural blonde with my genetic heritage has very fine, colorless, vellus-type hair, pretty much all over. My dear friends with more colorful fuzz are laughing at my distress over this fairy fuzz, but those who bleach theirs colorless understand when we both step out into any strong light-because it glistens and twinkles! I’m grateful it’s not coarse or long, and I know it’s natural and many ignore it. I applaud all who do and yet, I feel more “girly” with it off of my face. My skin is very sensitive and I read the reviews of others who claimed no irritation and was skeptical. I am a believer after having DRY, ahem, “exfoliated” from my forehead to my chin-even my eyelids below the brows-and I am irritation free! Not even a hint of those tiny not-quite-zits that can flash up if your face sweats soon after you’ve shaved! I’m so happy I tried these and will buy again. They are very precision for small clearances so they give great control. I’d like to thank (and need to re-find) the reviewer who left the information on how to locate replacement blades. Though my shavers don’t flex or twist and may be the wrong model.
EDIT: The last two lines about replacement blades and no flex or twist-I was mistaken as these applied to a small, battery operated, facial trimmer I’d purchased here some months back.",5,9,B0787GLBMV
"Ok let me start this review by saying I am a VERY hairy girl. LOL to put it in perspective for whoever is reading this... my peach fuzz is black... I have black thick hair on my cheeks/face and side burns that connect to the peach fuzz on my face, sexy right. My eyebrows are black and thick as well and I do not tint or color them. Hair removal has always been a pain for me ever since I was young and I used to get made fun of A LOT, now I get compliments on how thick my hair/eyebrows are blah blah blah... anyways... as I got older I started experimenting with make up I noticed it didn’t lay down as nicely on my face because of my facial hair. This was what prompted me to find a way for effective hair removal. I’m also on the go... don’t want a super complicated or time consuming routine... But as time went on I noticed this was hard... I tried everything EVERYTHING . Including buying my own wax, melting it... I bought the little electric battery operated thingy that they sell for like 15-20 dollars and it didn’t remove anything... I even shaved my face (do not recommend) and lastly I purchased facial razors of all kinds (you know the ones you find for cheap at TJmax or the store). I found those to not be very sharp for my thick hair. THESE razors are sharp and easy to use. The glide down my face, no irritation, easy and quick hair removal. I use them at least 3 times a week or whenever I see unwanted hair. The 3 pack last me about a two weeks bec I don’t like to use one for too long. This is also sharp enough to shave off your side burns... again super attractive. I cannot live without this product, I don’t recommend this for the bottom of eyebrows just the top and forehead clean up, which I do and it’s wonderful that and all over face including upper lip/chin. When removing hair it also acts like an exfoliator removing dead skin cells as well. Anyhow this review was not the easiest for me but I hope a hairy girl out these is reading this and it helps them out. I will be eventually getting laser hair removal but this does the job until it is possible.",5,4,B0787GLBMV
"I love these razors. The only reason I gave this item 4 stars was because I wish they had more than one ""precision cover"". They come with three razors so I purchased these for myself and a couple girlfriends who wanted to try them. Once opened we only had one cover to go around. They should really come with three covers. Regular razors have covers for all of their blades. That is the only issue. As long as you hold the skin tightly and hold the razor at an angle it glides smoothly. My skin looks great and I could not believe how much hair came off! My makeup went on today like silk!! My foundation has never looked so natural and smooth. I will be purchasing more for sure.",4,10,B0787GLBMV
"These are great! I have fine, thin, blonde hair and on my face, have peach fuzz all over. I use these tools to take care of the fuzz and they work really well.
The title makes it sounds like you're getting all kinds of tools but as far as I could tell, you get three of the same tool. They have a plastic handle and are easy to grip. The blade is sharp but very short and I haven't worried about cutting myself. The sides of the blade are enclosed so there isn't a risk of slicing your skin.

I've used mine 1-2 times a week for 6 months and it hasn't seemed to get too dull. I gave one to my 85 year old grandma who has whiskers that she can't see to tweeze. This razor is so easy to use and safe that she loves it, even without really being able to see what she's doing.

These are a great value and I certainly recommend them.",5,8,B0787GLBMV
"I love these facial razors for shaving the fuzz and dead skin off my face. I have dark hair and sensitive skin, which leaves me with few options to get rid of my upper lip hair. Lip bleach and nair hair removers give me red, blistery rashes, and make my skin break out. These face razors don’t irritate me like the other products.
Tips:
1. Moisturize your face first to soften the hairs and prevent razor burn.
2. Always shave downwards with your skin drawn tight to avoid tiny cuts.
3. Wipe the razor off with isopropyl alcohol before storing. This helps the razors stay sharp longer.",5,9,B0787GLBMV
"These didn't seem to do ANYTHING. I did a better job using a regular razor. They left stubble (my 5 blade does not). They are a complete waste of plastic. Use hair removal cream, threading, anything but these if you're looking for smooth skin.",1,14,B0787GLBMV
"I love this product. I have tried multiple razors and other products/devices for removing the peach fuzz on the face, and this is by far my favorite. I can get more precision for areas like around my brows and my upper lip than I can get with a traditional razor. It’s small and lightweight, which makes it easy to drop in my makeup bag for travel. This is all I need for removing unwanted facial hair.",5,12,B0787GLBMV
"I've been using the Tinkle brand razors for a couple of years now.. Mostly for that annoying peach fuzz that you can barely see but stops your foundation from looking as smooth as it should. And occasionally, I'd use them for stray Eyebrow hairs that I want able to get with my Wax Strips. They are Perfect for larger areas of the face.. They are sharp and shaped just right so they just slide over the contours of your face but the boxy like shape of them didn't make them ideal for going near the eyebrows. Just one wrong moves millimeter in the wrong direction could cost you half an Eyebrow. I saw these and decided to Subscribe and Save to them and I was VERY pleased with my first order. They are even better than the Tinkle Razors for your face.. They glide close to the skin without ever feeling like they much knick you. You can see not only the peach fuzz that was invisible to the eye but all the dead skin it removes as well when you wipe the blade off. And since I do my eyebrows and shaving same time every month, I was super happy to we e that they were also designed to be effective around the brow area without wreaking havoc. The couple of brow hairs I was left to remove with the razor.. I did so worry free. The razors come with a little plastic cap that goes over the razor leaving only an angled corner of the blades exposed.. The plastic covered the rest so you are able to be precise on removing your brow hair without having to worry about catching yourself with rogue blades. And these are an item I probably will only have to have delivered one every 5-6 months because of you take care of the blade, I wipe off with a soft, dry cloth throughout shaving then sanitize with an alcohol wipe before drying and capping the blade and they last a long time while staying sharp and not leaving so much as a scrape behind. I wish I'd have found these a lot sooner",5,5,B0787GLBMV
"I ordered these facial razors for dermaplaning because they had amazing reviews and were an affordable price. They definitely aren’t bad, they are probably the second best facial razors I’ve ever used. I personally feel a lot of these reviews were overhyped or exaggerated. My face is not overly hairy, and these are definitely a one time use only before I feel they’d be too dull to reuse again. It did remove all the hair, but I don’t feel it removed dead skin as efficiently as my favorite facial razors. I also had to work a little harder and longer with these razors. They did not leave any razor burn behind though, which is awesome!
The best facial razors I’ve ever tried are from Sally’s Beauty Supply. I don’t know what the Sally’s brand are called, they’re sold individually and come in light pastel colors at Sally’s. Those are by far the best facial razors I’ve ever used! They’re also extremely affordable. Sally’s just isn’t as convenient for me to go to. I will definitely finish this pack from Amazon, and I would buy again if I’m unable to pick up my favorites from Sally’s. I’ve tried facial razors sold at Walmart and Target and those were both AWFUL. They left razor burn all over my face and were extremely ineffective at even removing hair, let alone dead skin.
If these are convenient for you, I definitely say they’re worth a try!",4,4,B0787GLBMV
"Not sure what the hype is about for this product. I researched and read reviews for a week to make sure this would be a good option for me but unfortunately it wasn’t. I understand everyone’s skin types are different. I have sensitive skin and am super hair with peach fuzz so I wanted to give my review for others with the same type. Yes, it takes the dead skin off which is great. I’ve used once a week for a few weeks to give it time. After using this product it definitely feels like a mans face after he shaves. The stubbles are so bad I would rather just have the hair back. It grows back thick. Wish I wouldn’t have started this. My skin gets so irritated after that I have to soak in a bowl of cold water and burns the rest of the day. Lots of redness. This is just my experience.",2,3,B0787GLBMV
"I tried this product, hoping it would be faster and easier than using an electric slender shaver for peach fuzz and brow shaping. The razors dull very quickly, even when used according to directions. Therefore, I saved ONE just for cleaning up fine white hairs under my brow, using the guard that comes with the product. For that purpose it worked fine and it could be a useful tool for many. However, I have dry, sensitive skin and using it as intended and according to directions irritated my skin badly. Since I didn't bear down on the blade, I didn't get razor burn but it did redden my face after use. It doesn't work well on a pre-moisturized face, so I don't recommend for dry skin, sensitive skin or faces with a lot of peach fuzz. A personal touch electric personal shaver works much better.

Remember this is a razor blade when using. It is not safe to use in many places and ALWAYS use the included guard when trying to shave fine fuzz on earlobes or near your eyes! The guard protects you from cuts and poking your eye out!",3,4,B0787GLBMV
"Please note that I am blonde and do not have dark facial hair. I am also an idiot when it comes to self-care and have almost no experience with beauty products.

I've started noticing the peach fuzz on my face a bit lately, so looked around on Amazon to see what could be done about it. I ended up purchasing these because of the price point. It took me a few tries to get the hang of it - instead of an angle, I held the razor almost straight down. I brushed it lightly in a downward motion, and soon was grossed out by all the fine hairs that piled up.

Pros: good price, product lasts a long time with proper cleaning, any newb can do it, hairs do not grow back thicker or darker.
Cons: the first couple of days after using, your face will feel kind of rough. Not stubbly-legs rough, just not very soft.
Additional Con: You will examine your face wayyyy more than before and discover a black chin hair, which you didn't think you had to worry about until your 50s.",5,2,B0787GLBMV
"I researched the more expensive derma tools, the face is not a place to skimp. But after reading reviews, this one looked to do the job. I have used the same blade twice, it went very easy and amazing results. My skin glows because before I had a lot of clear/white hair. Now my jawline is defined and it was so easy to do. SHAVE YOUR SKIN TOTALLY DRY, this will help. Only reason its not 5 stars is I did read some people broke out after use, I had three new pimples but they are small and the scars I have had for months are much less after just one use. If I could give it a 4.5 I would. Great product, does the job!",4,16,B0787GLBMV
"I love to easy these are to use, and how long they last! I only use these to shave my eyebrows and other patches of facial hair for a smoother feel. They work great! They're sharp enough to cleanly shave my thick eyebrow hairs but not dangerously sharp. I've been gentle with these and I haven't cut myself. I bought these for my cousin and she loves them. I had these for many months now and use them once a week, so I'm only on my second razor. Again, I really enjoy this product!",5,7,B0787GLBMV
"I will start by saying that I am someone who is used to getting regular facials that include dermaplaning. I bought this because this service was no longer available to me during COVID (social distancing). I needed something to clear away dead skin and fine hairs. This product did NOT disappoint. The first time I used this blade/product I was absolutely amazed at the results.
I washed my face and hands before using this. Once my face was dry, I used this to clear away dried skin areas and fine hair. My face felt amazing. I then proceeded to follow my moisturizing routine. It latterly felt like I came from the spa.
There came 3 to a package so this was a great buy for the amount of money spent. I have used one blade roughtly 3-4 times and still don't feel the need to switch to a new blade yet.
Excellent purchase.",5,3,B0787GLBMV
"Man, there is something so satisfying when shaving peach fuzz and dry skin off your face. I had originally bought these for my eyebrows, which they are great for that, though I don't quite understand how to use the eyebrow guard. I have bought generic ones in the past from the drugstore , and these work far better . to the point where you have to be careful that you have eyebrows left. But then I started reading about dermaplaning. I was a little apprehensive because a lot of people said do not try this at home, but I know that is the only way I would get to try it. I don't have a particularly hairy face, and yet I found did that quite a bit of hair did come off. But the fun part is the dry skin Oh, and by Fun , I mean kind of gross and awesome. I've read where people do this like once a week and it has made a complete difference in there complexion, but I find once a week is overkill. The reason it helps so much is because products are able to sink into your skin better and makeup goes on smoother without all that dry skin and peach fuzz. You have to be careful though, because I could see this causing irritation if done incorrectly. So do your research and buy these things and use them on your eyebrows and you're mustache, and if you're brave, on the rest of your face. You won't be sorry.",5,3,B0787GLBMV
"Okay, I'm going to be brutally honest. I'm of that age where I've started growing fine blonde hairs all over my face. They are especially pronounced around my mouth, chin, eyebrows, and jawline. Because of the rules put into place by our state's Barber and Beautician Board, no one can get any type of waxing done while at the salon. Waxing my face was the only way I could manage to get all of the unwanted hair off my face. So, I've been spending serious time in front of the mirror trying to tweeze all this unwanted hair off my face. It wasn't working since a great deal of the unwanted facial hair is so fine that I couldn't get at it properly with the tweezer.

So, I took to Amazon to do some research and found this product--the Schick Silk Touch Up Multipurpose Exfoliating Dermaplaning Tool, Eyebrow Razor, and Facial Razor. Holy crap!!! All of the unwanted hair is gone!!! The best part is it took me less than 10 minutes to remove it all!

A few suggestions: I would definitely recommend using this product just after washing your face. I would also recommend using moisturizer afterward, especially if your face tends to be dry. I would also recommend thinking about the product like you are using a butter knife, but instead of bread, it is for your face. You need to watch which hand you are using and at what angle you are cutting. You don't want to knick your eyelid!

I also delivered one of these razors to my Mom because she's been suffering just like I have. She's been sitting in front of the mirror in the evening with the tweezers as well and she's absolutely frustrated with all the fine blonde hairs on her face. She just used hers and she called me with her report. She couldn't believe how well it worked, especially around her lips and eyebrows. She was really concerned about stubble and was leery to try it--but this razor cuts down extremely close to the face. She is thrilled with the result!",5,One,B0787GLBMV
"I have wanted some of these, seen them on the TV shopping shows, and now I find similar here on Amazon. Put them on subscribe and save. Used one for the first time and voila--bye bye peach fuzz!! Oh the joy as I had a lot of fuzz. I tend to exfoliate my skin regularly, so, didn't do much on that for me, but, having the fuzz gone is great, face is nice and soft. Only a couple hairs on my chin need to be done every other day, the rest of my face can go at least a week before I have to use this again. It didn't cause an redness or pain when using it.",5,4,B0787GLBMV
"I was so excited to try these. I usually use a small tool that just trims the hair all over my face, but once in a while just use an actual razor because it gets it all. Since these are actually made specifically for the race though, I figured they would be great. Nope. I tried with a cream face wash, and also tried with a dry face. Each time, using the blade in any direction did not work at all. My face is still covered in peach fuzz and the occasional dark hairs. How did it not work whatsoever?! I don’t understand.",1,10,B0787GLBMV
"Easy to use-glad I didn’t listen to bad reviews. I hesitated for awhile to actually try them because I was nervous! I searched Pinterest for other people that use similar dermaplaning razors for tips. I washed my face really well and then used the razors. You really don’t have to presshard at all snd maybe it’s more about the angle - why some people had bad luck. Honestly though- some of the pics i saw in review I wouldn’t imagine that’s possible unless just super pressing down hard. After I finished I used toner and moisturizer and my face is sooo smooth! I am very happy with results. I’m 41 and last year developed peach fuzz and it bothers me. Luckily masks cover some of that now. Haha
Anyway I’m really happy with these and plan to stick with this same method- clean face, use razor, toner, moisturize.",5,One,B0787GLBMV
Poorly designed resulting in scratches. Not sharp enough and leaves the skin severely irritated and itchy. I've used smaller versions of these with success but these are far too dull.,1,8,B0787GLBMV
"These work great! I’m in my mid-40s and had been wanted to try home dermaplaning. Because our skin does not regenerate as quickly as we get older, we build up more layers of dead cells that just sit there and make her skin look dull. Removing the fine hairs and dead skin gives you a glow and reduces the appearance of fine lines. If you wear foundation, it also goes on more smoothly and evenly. The process is easy, effective, and not painful at all, though the blade can feel irritating in sensitive areas or if you get to aggressive with shaving. I’ll definitely be ordering more!",4,3,B0787GLBMV
I don't know how these did well in reviews. If you look at your skin blown up theses leave scrapes. they can also still cut skin even with safety wires. I wont ever try these or any other brand again. They also don't remove hair better than a little safe handheld eyelrow shaver pen,1,7,B0787GLBMV
"These are great for touchups on my brows to remove all the little excess hairs around them. I love that they come with the little attachment to make the blade smaller since the brow area is so tight to maneuver around. I bought these intending to use them just for my brows, but after trying them on my brows I decided to also use them on my peach fuzz on my cheeks, chin, and neck. I usually use Nair for that but it's painful and a little cumbersome to use on a regular basis. These blades worked great to quickly take all that hair off, but I will say that you need to be slow and careful. I didn't expect these blades to be quite as sharp as they are (my fault), so I did nick myself a few times. It's important to have the blade at the right angle to maximize the amount of hair that comes off, so it may take a couple times to get the hang on it. Also, my skin did feel a little irritated and itchy after using these, so they may not be the best for sensitive skin.",4,2,B0787GLBMV
"I’ve never been a fan of waxing, and plucking was so time-consuming, so I’d typically trim my eyebrows (etc) with a regular razor. But the shaving method left me with itchy skin as the hair grew back, and it would grow back blunt and uneven. I read about this Schick Hydro Silk dermaplaning tool on a Buzzfeed product review, and the article mentioned the product’s affordable price, so I figured I’d give it a try. Whoo buddy, this little thing really did the trick!

I’ll admit that ‘dermaplaning’ sounded like a complicated term, but this ‘touch-up’ tool is awesome! It’s basically a razor but not dangerously sharp, and you hold it like a pencil so you have much better control while you shave with precision. I’ve used it mostly on my eyebrows (making sure to have the guard attachment on), but it also works great on peach fuzz, around my upper lip, along my jawline, and helps me keep my sideburns trimmed in between haircuts (especially helpful during COVID, when haircuts aren’t really an option). I particularly love how each tool (it’s a 3-pack) comes with its own little plastic cap so the blade doesn’t turn dull or get messed up when I throw it in a drawer until the next use.

This 3-pack will last for a really long time, so I don’t have to buy new razors for quite a while. Using this definitely reinforces my preference for shaving, though now I can call it ‘dermaplaning’ and feel extra fancy. 10/10 would certainly recommend it for anyone who doesn’t want to bother with waxing or plucking, or just needs a cheap but reliable tool to keep their eyebrows (etc) flawless in between regular maintenance.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"I finally caved and decided to try adding dermaplaning into my skincare routine after being sick of either going bare-faced forever (which isn't bad, just sometimes I'd like to look fancy) or resigning myself to always being slightly cakey or just not a polished as I could be.

It's made a huge difference in how my foundations look! So much smoother and natural, luminous finishes are actually luminous and not halfway matte, I can actually buff products into my skin without caking or those ugly little ""dots"" from clinging onto the hair. It just looks so much more polished. I do have to be extra vigilant about the peach fuzz around my nose and chin as they're a bit more stubborn in getting shaved but these are a game-changer as far as I'm concerned.

It is bit tricky to get around the folds of my nose and outside the corners of my eyes with the blades but nothing terrible so long as I go slow and carefully. The blades aren't as sharp as my safety razor but they will cause irritation if you do too many passes over an area. My advice? If you have thick/coarse hairs or stubborn areas, do some one day and then come back in a day or two and go back over it so you don't end up with raw, burning skin when you go to apply serums or lotions later on.",,One,B0787GLBMV
"I originally got this because I wanted to TRY to shape my eyebrows myself. Then I saw how people were using it to clean their face? It supposedly made the face look better and more glowy. I tried today and I'm kinda sad about it. Either I don't know how to use this thing correctly, or I'm pressing too hard, I don't know. I ended up scratching my face up and it looks kinda bad and feels bad without moisturizer on. It did cut away at my eyebrows though. It also is pretty nice to remove the little hairs like on your arms or fingers. It is easy to hold and has a little cap that covers the sharp part. It's pretty nice but I don't think I'll be using it anymore since my face got ruined but maybe I'll use it for my arms",3,2,B0787GLBMV
"I bought these razors for all over ""peach fuzz"" on my face and under my chin. It works great, and as others have mentioned, even exfoliates a little because it takes the dead skin with the hair. I do have a little sensitivity the following day, so I only do one side of my face at a time.

I have plucked dark, course hairs on my chin and upper lip, ever since they first appeared about 5 years ago (another perk of aging!). I never used the razors for these. I am now getting laser hair removal on these area and for the best results, I can't pluck them at all.

These little razors came to the rescue! I Use them between treatments. It doesn't look quite as good as when plucked, but does the trick...when not at home, I am wearing a face mask anyhow , so no-one can even see that part of my face.

My sensitive and aging skin are minimally bothered by the shaving, as long as I use them gently and on dry skin. I have ""overdone"" it a couple of times and it did irritate and even break the skin, but that was my fault for being a little too aggressive.",5,6,B0787GLBMV
"Since it was my first time using it, I figured it was best to be gentle. I washed my face and patted it dry, and then used gentle small strokes. It did remove an impressive amount of peach fuzz. But my skin felt like it was on fire after using this! Putting my moisturizer on helped with the burning, but my face itches now and I have razor bumps above my lip and on one cheek. Maybe my skin is just too sensitive for this.",1,4,B0787GLBMV
"I suppose it's my hearty peasant German ancestry, but I've always been a hair girl. Plucking the more egregious of the thick black hairs is at least a 2-3x/week effort to prevent full on Duck Dynasty beard. But those almost invisible, insidious peach fuzz hairs are the bane of my existence. Depilatories work okay, but so harsh on the skin. Since I have super sensitive skin, it was always a gamble whether I'd get chemical burn. I'd been eying these razors for a while and finally took the plunge.

Opened rather hesitantly--I mean, they are sharp blades going on your face--took a sip of Prosecco for courage, washed my face and started shaving. I could not believe how easy and quick it was. After a couple swipes down my cheek, I noticed that it was done. I thought it was going to take a lot more skill and time. First complete face shave (full cheeks, upper lip, lower lip, jawline) over and done with in less than three minutes with outstanding results. So much easier than tweezers and depilatories!! Wow.

I got up this morning to smoother skin than I've had since I was pre-puberty. I imagine it's something that will need to be done regularly to keep it up, but since it's so quick and easy, that's no big deal.

I did try the eyebrow guard, which worked fine--not as dramatic as the peach fuzz eradication, but I wasn't as much in the market for the eyebrow shaping. So I wouldn't rely on my recommendation if you're really looking for an eyebrow tool.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"I had been getting a professional lip and chin waxing every three weeks for the past 10 or more years. I was VERY nervous about switching to shaving. After all, we have been indoctrinated with the idea that shaving will only make things worse. I did some research online, and read over and over that shaving does not make hair get darker or grow faster. Of course, unlike waxing you are cutting it off at the skin line, not pulling it out below the skin line. I finally tried shaving, and I love it. I still pluck stray hairs regularly (as I did with the waxing), and shave about every two weeks. I can determine when I need it, and I don't have to let the hair grow out to a certain length, as I did with waxing. Saving money, saving time, and looking better more consistently - what's not to like. One person mentioned cutting themselves. I have been careful, and have not had ANY problems. Happy I switched.",5,2,B0787GLBMV
"I know facial razors are not suppose to be sharpe, but I felt like I had to scrap at my skin to get any hair off. It couldn’t even take off peach fuzz let alone my eyebrows. At one point I really try to see if it could even hurt my hand and it didn’t even leave a scratch.
They are easy enough to use, I just didn’t get a great result. I will be trying another brand next time.",1,7,B0787GLBMV
"First time I have bought these, and I love them! So easy to use, and I can't believe how well they work. I used them for the peach fuzz on the sides of my face (sideburn and cheek area) and mustache area. The fuzz is really pale, but I think that my makeup looks so much smoother without it. I only do it about once a month, maybe a little more often. I was using a disposable razor, but this is quicker and seems to do a better job. (It's a LOT quicker! and easier, too!) I did try the little guard thing for my brows. I would never try to actually shape my brows, but I did use it to clean up the bigger areas under them. And if you are someone who has to clean up between them (unibrow) this would be really efficient.",5,3,B0787GLBMV
"I am a woman with a pretty hairy face. I also am very fair skinned with reddish undertones to my skin so my skin is very dry and sensitive. I choose to dermaplane because when I wax my face, I break out a lot and the wax always tears layers of skin off which hurts like hell.

These razors are not very well made. They don’t get the hair off down to the skin, they leave about a millimeter of hair on the skin because of the guard. Essentially it just cuts the hair reeeeally short and then you can feel the roughness to the freshly cut hair which almost feels worst then the long softer peach fuzz.

Also the razor is not straight, its rigid and rough so it scratches the crap out of my face. I am very gentle on my face, I have a very soft touch and it still scratches my face quite a bit which makes it look like my cat mauled me or it’s obvious that I shave my face.

Lastly I only ever get 1 really good use from it and that means minimal scratching and it catching all the hairs. After using it 1 time it’s crap.

I won’t be buying these again, I will have to look for a better alternative. I’ve been looking at the ones Sephora sells because they are straight and don’t have the millimeter guard on the edges so hopefully it’ll take the hair down as short as possible. They also come in a 3 pack and are only $10.

Don’t waste your money on these, go try other brands first.",2,0,B0787GLBMV
"I recently watched a video online regarding older women shaving their faces 1) to improve the smoothness by the mild dermabrasive aspect of these shavers and 2) to remove all facial hair to provide a cleaner canvas for makeup. I have been using one of the 3 shavers in the package for a few days. Here are my thoughts:

The shaver is very light and easy to hold. It’s easy to clean. It comes with a safety guard for safe storage. It’s sharp but I have not nicked or cut myself. I shaved my forehead, temples, checks, nose, above mouth, chin and neck. I took off stray hairs on my brow bone to clean up my eyebrows. It is very effective at precisely removing hair. It is also great at removing dry, dead skin! I can easily see the cells when I clean it off. The day after my initial use of the shaver, my natural body oils came back to life. My skin looks brighter and is smoother. My makeup looks smoother.

I am very happy with the results. I highly recommend this amazing little tool, especially for older women.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"I LOOOOVE these!!!! I was very skeptical and hesitant to buy them after reading reviews that said they were damaging to the skin since I have sensitive skin. However, I decided to give them a try since they're not too expensive and boy was it a good idea. This tool is so precise and once I got the hang of how to use it and the right angle, I could not stop using it. I groomed my face completely and touched up my eyebrows and it did a fantastic job at this. I even used it to clean up some stray arm hairs just to see how it would do and it took them off smoothly with no problem at all. I was really cautious about hard I pressed after reading reviews and I think that is the key to this tool's success. Start out scraping very gently until you figure out how hard you can press. I've used this tool several times now with no cuts or scratches! The fact that you get 3 in one pack for so cheap is great because 1 seems durable and sharp enough to last a pretty long time.",5,One,B0787GLBMV
"First off, I’ll mention that I’ve never used anything like this before. New medication has caused unwanted hair growth on my face and I was sure how to deal with it, so I gave this a try. I read the packaging and it doesn’t offer any tips. Using a razor on my face for the first time was uncomfortable and I was afraid of knicks.

Anyway I gave it a shot and I was very surprised how well it exfoliated my skin (didn’t realize I needed exfoliation - but holy cow that’s next on my to-do list after using this razor!). This razor really did a great job with exfoliation. I was so impressed!

It also removed all of the unwanted hairs from my face, and I used it to shape my eyebrows. I can’t believe how pretty I look after using this product! No knicks or cuts either. I did scratch myself once, but the tiny mark went away easily with water. Seriously though... my eyebrows have never looked better! I’m thrilled.

Definitely worth every penny and more. Highly recommend.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"Edit:
I ended up purchasing the flawless razor my clients raved about but was severely disappointed by its performance. I followed the instructions to a tee, replaced the battery, still didn’t get the hairs. So I’m altering my review & adding a star because these are cheaper & did a closer shave.

Original:
I bought this product hoping for a razor that is smaller for smaller areas to shave, such as between my eyebrows, as well as hoping for a closer shave on those pesky dark hairs on my chin (thank you kindly to my 2 children & hitting my 30s for contributing). While it is smaller, it kind of stops there. When I use it to shave my face, it tears up my skin - not in a good way. As a medical aesthetician, I would not recommend using this for dermaplaning, as I'm quite certain this is actively causing more damage. A few of my clients have recently mentioned using the Nu Flawless razor to get a closer shave between laser hair removal treatments, so I would recommend looking into that instead. It might cost more, but from what I have observed with my clients, it is worth the money.",4,0,B0787GLBMV
"I love this product. Very easy to use. Great for facial hair and also helps in cleaning the eyebrows. Also, can be used to give shape to the eyebrows. But you need to use a lot of caution and time. A great life saver during COVID times. I have been using this for a few months now. I love the price point and 3 pack will at least last for six months. I am using a portable eyebrow trimmer along with this. But for a few months, I was using this standalone. Also, it is painless. I am hesitant in using facial hair remover creams and this works like a charm for facial hair. I think it is easier and less time consuming than hair removal creams for facial hair. Also, the face feels very soft after using this product.",5,One,B0787GLBMV
"I was hoping that this would be a good tool for dermaplaning after seeing some good reviews. But unfortunately I would NOT recommend it at all. The blade is really rough and it felt like it was just scratching my skin. Afterwards there were a lots of small scratches on my skin. I have been dermaplaning for ages and haven’t had this problem before, other blades that I have used did not feel this rough. Very disappointed.",1,8,B0787GLBMV
"I saw a beauty influencer recommend these. I had been using the flawless dermaplaning tool for some time. After I got these, I had to try them right away. It had been some time since I dermaplaned my face so i knew i had enough hair to try it. From the first few swipes i could already tell these were better than the flawless tool. The blade is so much sharper and gets much closer to the skin. I was even able to do under my brows with the plastic protected top and not fear i was going to hack my brows off. I could not do that with the flawless blade. My face feels so smooth from removing the hair and dead skin, so much dead skin. Highly recommend these for full face at home dermaplaning. If you feel comfortable enough, save your money going to the esthetician and go get these now!",5,One,B0787GLBMV
I just tried these this morning though I bought them six weeks ago. These are not what you think. They chew up your face. Do yourself a favor and just use a good women’s razor (or men’s) with a bit of oil on your face and rinse the blade under hot water every few strokes. Don’t press too hard against your skin or you will cut you face. For the little hairs you’re wanting to get rid of you needn’t press hard anyway. Practice before you plan for a big event so you know just what to expect from your skin. Using this method is great for creating a nice surface pre-makeup.,1,6,B0787GLBMV
"I’ve only been “dermaplaning” for a couple of years. I had previously used what I found at beauty supply stores. Since the pandemic, I’ve been ordering from Amazon and found these and they are the best that I’ve found so far. It takes off more peach fuzz and dead skin than the other shavers that I’ve used. Sterilizing with alcohol before and after use is very important. After use, my face looks brighter and is definitely smoother. After dermaplaning, I use a hydrating serum and moisturizer. I don’t use a toner or astringent. Overall my skin looks healthier and even a bit younger!",4,One,B0787GLBMV
"I was hoping for a product that would be very sharp and precise and last longer than the Tickle ones I bought on Amazon (which are debatably authentic). Unfortunately I’d say they perform equally as well as the Tinkle ones— they are decent and function well for larger areas of the face and brow, however are not sharp or precise enough for, say, shaping up your arch. Because of this, I have slightly misshapen my brows a couple times. I am an artist with a steady hand and sharp eye so this is not due to sloppiness. This simply is not high enough quality for actual shaping. Instead I use it for getting rid of peach fuzz on my face and shaving brow hairs in larger areas that require less precision, like between my brows and near the tail.
My search will continue for a truly sharp and precise blade!",3,4,B0787GLBMV
"I've been ""shaving"" my face for a couple years now with the FlawlessTouch mini razor however it wasn't getting my face as smooth as it used to. I decided to give these a try. I'm not sure I love them but they are good. They get a close shave and are easy to hold and use. The big downside is that the end of the razor and the plastic are really rough and it scratch me in several places. It didn't cut, it scratched like taking a stick and running it across your skin. I feel if the ends were shaped differently, they would be much better. I did get a little razor burn under my nose. I probably should have used the cap on it there. I didn't like them for my eyebrows.. I feel these are too big to get the eyebrow area well. A small/shorter blade would be better. Even with the cap on these. It was too long to get a good angle. Also, be careful going over moles. It hurts.",4,0,B0787GLBMV
"These are great! I use them once a week to keep my face exfoliated. Having the peach fuzz gone makes for a very smooth canvas for makeup application. Use it even beneath the brows (go VERY slowly and carefully near the brows and your hairline so you don't remove the hair you want to keep!) Make sure you even get the tops of your cheekbones and your highlighter will look really beautiful. Just make sure that you keep the razor level. Don't let it tip in or you can get a scratch on your face. I learned that the hard way. But even if you do scratch yourself, it's pretty mild. These are very safe if you use them properly, and it's hard to really hurt yourself. I get 2 or 3 uses from each razor.",5,One,B0787GLBMV
"I think these are good but I’ve been using the Tinkle razors for awhile and the first time I touched one of these Schick Silk Touch-Up razors to my face I realized how easily you could cut yourself if you weren’t careful.
I think the quality is good but I was a little more afraid of it. I don’t really see a purpose in the guard cover either that comes with it because you can just angle it in such a way to only shave a certain spot but maybe it would be useful to others who aren’t as hand-to-eye coordinated. I would recommend it to others though if it was between this and a lower quality beauty razor.",4,4,B0787GLBMV
"Product review at bottom..
I definitely think dermaplaning is NOT for sensitive skin. If you're not sure, consult a doctor before dermaplaning at home. Stop using products with retinol, or other chemicals that make your skin sensitive to sun damage, at least 4 days beforehand. If you have a breakout, that area is sensitive and should be avoided.

Personally I had a good experience, having educated myself beforehand, acknowledging the risks and prevention methods to not damage my skin. I use SPF30 sunscreen daily and hydrate at night with an oat serum for sensitive skin. My process: I clean my face with a Dove bar and then toner (you can use witch hazel) before dermaplaning. After, I use a hemp and aloe extract to hydrate and allow my skin to heal. I will do this max once/month.

TLDR:
These blades are excellent and will likely last for 2 uses each, since I only use them for my face. Buying this 3-pack means it will last me 6 months, plenty of time before my wedding!",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"I am so happy I purchased these. After going back and forth on these vs the twinkle razors I chose these. I like to shave my face as it gets rid of peach fuzz, exfoliates your face, and your makeup applies much better (and no... the hair doesn’t grow back long and thick like most people thing) I currently use the Ardell eyebrow razors for my face and these razors are 100% better. I had recently shaved my face and wanted to try these out and I was shocked by the extra hair that came off. These are much longer than the ardell razors but it comes with a tip to make them shorter. These are sharp so be careful. These were wonderful and made my face feel so smooth. I would 100% purchase these again and these will be the new razors I use! So glad I went with this option.",5,2,B0787GLBMV
"Dermaplaning is traditionally done in a dermatologists office using a razor edge to brush away the top layer of dead skin and peach fuzz from the face and neck area.
This prepares your skin and makes it very responsive to serums and creams.
I’ve had dermaplaning done by a dermatologist before- so I was honestly skeptical that these would work for anything beyond removing a little peach fuzz.
Here’s my honest review:
They remove peach fuzz and the top layer of dead skin. They do not remove AS much as an actual razor- but pretty close.
My skin felt soft and I always use a toner immediately after, along with a vitamin C serum. My skin really did feel “glowy” and super clean after. You can tell it really worked because your makeup goes on so smoothly afterward.
I will definitely use again!",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"Product does what it's supposed to do, but for eyebrows I think it's a little abrasive. I've got a similar product that states it's used for the bikini area, but I used for my eyebrows and I've never had it cut the skin. Needed a new one so tried this one out. Will no longer use.",2,4,B0787GLBMV
"These are great! I don’t have a ton of body hair (my hair is very fine) but one day I was applying my makeup in the car and the early morning sunlight was glimmering off of my peach fuzz. I was horrified! I had never noticed, in the bathroom mirror, how much peach fuzz I had all over my face, and how much my makeup just caught all over it :/ So I had to do something. I got these little guys and problem solved. They are easy to use, sharp, and just removes all the fuzz! I didn’t get any bumps, cut, or stubble after using them.

I then tried to buy a big pack of similar razors for cheaper, and what a waste of money! The “budget” razors were dull and worthless. They irritated my skin and didn’t seem to remove any hair.

If you have peach fuzz or hair on your face, do yourself a favor and get these.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"I am a natural blonde & therefore have fine, silky peach fuzz on the sides of my face, above & next to my brows & under my chin. It interferes with makeup application & to be honest, is just plain embarrassing. These little tools are very effective for removing that peach fuzz. It’s easy to use. It works & Im happy to have found them here on Amazon. Safer than using a full size shaver. Small & easy to maneuver around the curves of my face. These do a better job than those electric gadgets & don’t need batteries.!!! I also use this to remove the hair on my arms. Try it once & you won’t go back. I hope this is helpful.",,One,B0787GLBMV
"My first foray into dermaplaning. I’m sure I’m not doing it to the standard of a professional, but it’s not really in the budget to get facials. I use this not for hair removal but for dead skin removal. My skin changed with my last pregnancy and is prone to extreme buildup; I had to exfoliate daily to keep up with it. I used this to clear dead skin on my face, and concentrated on my nose and around my mouth mostly, where it was the worst. It worked well for my nose!! After a couple months of regular use, the constant flaking of dead skin on my nose Finally ceased! I haven’t had a problem since!! However, the serrated edge of the blades were not kind to the area around my mouth. Skin would grow back flakier and more irritated than the at the start and has taken months to fully heal, with intense moisture treatment. I think a flat blade is likely more effective, but my guess is it would also be potentially horrific if done improperly.

UPDATE: purchased a flat scalpel blade to try and it’s MUCH better than these. The edge of these ones are serrated like a steak knife. There is no way for them to not leave tiny micro cuts, even when used perfectly. I suggest getting surgical grade scalpels and just exercising extreme caution when using.",3,0,B0787GLBMV
"I am thrilled with these and wish I ordered years ago! I have a lot of fine facial hair which makes me self conscious. I try to wax and it not only hurts, but still leaves lots of hairs behind. Even though these had excellent reviews I was a bit worried that 1) I would feel like a man shaving my face and 2) would I cut myself. Both worries immediately vanished the second I tried it. It was actually very satisfying, painless, quick, does seem to exfoliate a bit too, and not scary at all. And my face is so smooth! I’m only ordered a 3-pack but am reordering more now.",5,2,B0787GLBMV
"I don’t usually write reviews, but this product is so good I had to! I’ve been struggling with figuring out how to get rid of my facial hair for awhile now. I used to pay to get my face waxed, but the hair would grow back in a few days and it was $60 to get my whole face done. (Ridiculous!) I was too nervous to wax my face on my own. So my only other option was this product or the finishing touch product. I decided to try Schick because it got better reviews- what made me the most nervous was people saying they cut their faces up and I was also worried the hair would grow back dark.

Before I started dermaplainin, I rinsed my face with warm water, patted it dry, and rubbed moisturizer lotion from the drug store all over my face ($5). I gently swiped a downward motion on my face (sideburns, cheeks, forehead, etc) and wiped off hair with a paper towel. I couldn’t believed how much hair came off and how easy it was!!! When I was done I washed my face with face wash and patted it dry and put more lotion on it. It was a little tender after, but the redness went down shortly after. I only have to do this two times a week and it’s super cheap and works great! I would reccomend this product to anyone that wants an affordable option for removing facial hair and not to mention it also makes your skin softer/prettier! :)",5,One,B0787GLBMV
"I used to love these. I loved them so much I bought them again. But the second pack I bought were absolutely Horrible!

Enter this wonderful product! I youtubed how to use and went for it. WOW! My skin is glowing...absorbs my serums much better and I can actually wear powder again. I had given up powder at my age because it had an aging effect. After using this to remove dead skin and peach fuzz, powder accentuates my face once again. I believe this has turned back the clock...my husband has noticed...I feel beautiful and it has not hurt my delicate skin. Try it!",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"I think I’m razor savvy - I use an old school safety razor routinely for legs and pits. In making this blade theoretically safer, it really just leads to potential micro scratches from the serrated type blade. And I go slow.

(I’m just using for a bit of exfoliation - I don’t have much fuzz.)",2,5,B0787GLBMV
"I use this for at home dermaplaning and have had a noticeable difference in my bad acne, and fine lines. Before doing this, buy NON SCENTED face lotion, or serum, or the best stuff you can find and make sure to have a HEALTHY face routine. Don’t go overboard and do not ignore your face. Have a morning and night routine or you will be making your face worse. Make sure to moisturize, moisturize, moisturize!!!!! If your skin doesn’t clear up, we know that dairy and sugar elimination has been a major improvement for people with bad acne. Do it!! It helped me long before I dermaplaned.

"I’m not sure how long this product has been around, but I wish that I would have stumbled upon it sooner! It easily gets of rid peach fuzz, stray hairs, and the fine, little, blonde eyebrow hairs on my brow bone that are difficult to see. It shaves the hairs down very close to the skin, and it appears to make the hair grow back more slowly - maybe? This little miracle trimmer/razor also provides pretty spectacular exfoliation in the process! I have tried many methods of facial hair removal, and each method had at least 2 to 3 negative things about it. Eventually, my hair removal goal is to either buy a personal laser hair removal unit, or have it done professionally, but until then, this little guy is a blessing! Just remember to clean the blade thoroughly after each use! The blade cover (I don’t mean the blade cap) comes off so that you can actually take the blade off to clean it properly.

"I noticed that all three blades had a rough spot at the top of the blade which at certain angles would scratch my face. The blades would also 'pull at' rather than 'cut through' the hairs at some points during the shave but this is possibly due to the angle at which you have to hold the blade? However, I felt I held the blade consistently but that I didn't get consistent results. I also had to go over several areas to get a ‘close shave’ and to get all the hairs. I did like how the blade got some dry skin patches off my face but sadly I won't be purchasing these again. Overall, I feel like they weren’t consistent in their performance and the rough patch on the blades is concerning.",2,One,B0787GLBMV
"Bought these to try at home dermaplaning for the first time. I have sensitive skin so I was very hesitant but I figured if I was going to do it, I should choose a well known brand. I'm glad I chose these. They worked just as I hoped. They are sharp enough but not too sharp, they are easy to hold because of the shape/size, and they took off hair very simply without complicating an already nerve wracking experience. Definitely would recommend for anyone interested in trying at home dermaplaning for the first time. Tip - use face oil to help the blade glide easily, and even better if you can use an oil with anti-inflammatory properties.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"I'm in love with this product and it works super well for how I use it. It's not very good for shaving off peach fuzz because it seems to not be sharp enough and it just can't pick the fuzz up and off of the face (at least for me). However, it's so amazing for (I'm sorry I have to say it) hairy faces. I shave my face once a week and the results are great. My face looks smoother and less dark and hairy looking. Shaving my face does make it really dry after because of how long I go without moisturizer (I have dry skin).

This isn't supposed to be moisturizing and I really wouldn't recommend this for sensitive skin. Dermaplaining, in general, is quite harsh and I don't exactly use this product for what it's mainly for. When using this, you should be very careful as it is easy to overdo the shaving and irritate your skin a lot (it's not comfortable but for me, it's lasted for only around a day or two). You can also end up cutting yourself badly, of course. I've never done that, though.",4,0,B0787GLBMV
"i tried these since we couldnt get waxes etc. these actually worked really well. it takes a bit of technique as the first time i used it i got a little crazy and shaved a tiny bit of the inside of my eyebrow off lol. but otherwise these worked great for what the situation is calling for. i also like that you can do your whole face, cheeks, chin, etc. dont press too hard as you might cut your skin, you only need a little bit of pressure and go at a little bit of an angle. good deal to have 3 in a pack",5,One,B0787GLBMV
"The first time I used this product, I was horrified and simultaneously fascinated by the amount of peach fuzz this razor removed from my facial skin. I was so addicted to using it the first few days that I actually made my skin bleed. This is not the product's fault, I just really enjoyed using it. Luckily, I got over that and now use it like a normal person about once a week. My skin has improved since using it and my skincare products seems to work better as well. I gave it 4 stars because I think the blades dull fast. I would rather spend a little more and have a better blade. Worth the money. Great product.",4,One,B0787GLBMV
"I ordered this because paying $65 for dermaplanning appointments was getting really expensive. I am 25 years old and am trying to hone down on a skin care regimen that is not only effective in keeping my skin healthy and acne-free, but at this age also wrinkle free! Dermaplanning with this was very easy. I washed my face with dermatology face wash, pat dried my face, and then applied Thayer's toner on my face before using this. I did not add any oil to my face, but I may do this next time since there is a bit of a burning sensation when you're getting the dead skin off certain areas of your face. I got ALL of my facial hair off and was able to see the dried, scaly skin accumulate on the blade. I am extremely impressed. I highly recommend having a VERY moisturizing mask/gel prepared so when you finish dermaplanning you can apply it on your skin. I have a lot more hormonal acne now with my IUD, so I stayed away from those active acne spots, but did get the areas around them. I loved it! It felt just like when I went to the spa to get this done. I will be sure to come back on in a month to show result since this is the first time I've ever done it on my own. I am really wanting to get some anti-aging techniques into my skin care and this is one proven method. I absolutely recommend watching several videos and reading from aesthetician blogs/articles to know if your skin is good for this. I have combo skin with mild fine lines and terrible pores, so I recommend introducing this into your regimen, along with daily Vitamin C serum, hyaluronic serum, a good moisturizer (with collagen if possible), and SPF 30< sun screen (recommend MURAD anti-aging SPF 30 sunscreen).",5,One,B0787GLBMV

Just let them gently glide at an angle and you won’t be disappointed. I was a little hesitant after seeing the pics in some reviews and learned from their mistakes.

I will say, go easy the first time, and pay attention to your eyebrows...I actually shaved off a portion 😂. My skin was very sensitive, but aloe gel really helped. I did my treatments seven days apart.",5,One,B0787GLBMV
"Wow, I was not expecting to be so pleased with these razors! I recently moved to a very isolated area so regular brow waxing is no longer an option. These razors keep my caterpillar brows in check and have saved me a good bit of money. They take a minute to get used to (do not apply pressure, let the blade do the work) and they won’t cut or knick you. I even used one on my bikini line after shaving and it cleaned up nicely. I’d definitely be interested in a more sustainable handle option other than plastic, but these last nicely when kept clean and dry. P.S. As someone with super sensitive skin, I recommend dabbing witch hazel on the skin after razor use to prevent irritation. This being said, I am impressed with how smooth, gentle, and effective these razors are so far!",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"What a great inexpensive find. One of my beauty splurges are trips to the dermatologist for a treatment - facial, microdermabrasion, peel, etc. Dermaplaning was one of the services I enjoyed. Now that I can safely do it at home, I can pick another service from the aesthetician. Very simple to use and I got the same results. Takes off all the facial fuzz so my moisturizer and makeup work better and last longer on my smooth face. Amazing.",5,One,B0787GLBMV
"I have been morbidly curious about dermaplaning for a while now, and I finally decided to give it a try. I had never ""shaved"" my face before, and didn't really need to, but wanted to see what all the rage was about. These razors are super easy to use and removed a TON of hair and dead skin that I didn't realize was there. I didn't cut myself at all, but be careful around pimples and other blemishes/moles. I did have a little razor burn near my jaw line, but I guess I wasn't being too careful. My skin has felt a little sensitive and almost leathery/weird since I shaved, but I think it's just shocked that its so bare now. Anyways, if you've been wanting to give dermaplaning a go at home, this is definitely a good product. Not sure if I'll keep dermaplaning, but only because of how my skin reacted, not because this wasn't a good razor. Try it!",4,0,B0787GLBMV
I’ve always had dry but oily skin and peach fuzz everywhere. I also dislike plucking my eyebrows. I heard about this for both better makeup application and shaving eyebrows. I tried them out the other day after my shower and it worked wonders. You can see all the hair and skin come off it’s so satisfying. Just be careful as you can cut yourself. I nicked myself on my nose but it was an awkward angle. It definitely helped with my makeup and eyebrow care. My boyfriend even let me shave his eyebrows as he won’t let me pluck them anymore. This product has been a great success for me!,5,0,B0787GLBMV
"I have a lot of vestigial hair and have dealt with it thus far by being a compulsive tweezer. This has caused some skin issues for me. I allowed my skin several months to heal from the compulsive tweezing and purchased this product to exfoliate my facial skin by way of derma planing and I was beyond shocked by how many dead skin cells and blackheads were removed right along with the hair.
My only concern is that they hairs may come back in grown. I have very sensitive skin and I am prone to ingrown hairs but I haven’t gotten that far yet so I will report back later to let you know what happens. So far I am extremely satisfied with this product. I know it can be a little scary to take a razor blade or a scalpel to your face but it was easier than I thought it would be!",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"As I’ve gotten older my facial hair has come in more making me very self conscious. I tried facial waxing (professionally done). My face was a mess of red patches and bumps for a week and SORE. Then we were given the Stay At Home order so I could have it done again. I tried Nomads Facial Wax Strips which didn’t work very well but still made my skin a mess. In researching, these were recommended. I had an attitude about using something that seemed like “guy shaving” but tried it anyway. These are super easy to use, great for shaping eyebrows, removed every bit of the fine hair on my face and exfoliated. My skin felt so smooth afterward. I highly recommend especially for those with sensitive skin!",5,One,B0787GLBMV
"My daughter bought me a facial razor, I didn't know how to use it, so I went to youtube. The razor my daughter bought me scratched my face with the tip of it, you have to angle the blade and that is when the scratching occurred. I was very careful every time I used it, but still, it always scratches my face. I bought this brand just to try it out because the price was right. It is soft on my face, the first time I try it I was impressed, I could see the dry skin and hair being removed from my face, no scratches, and removes my facial hair. I was skeptical at first but I am glad I gave it try.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"This product works great, I’ve always been a hairy little monster and this made me feel more baby faced than I EVER have. While I wouldn’t say it exfoliates and shaves off those dead layers of skin like a real dermatologist could, it does it’s job as a cheap lil razor. My skin is soft and I’m finally not self conscious when natural light shines on my face. If you want a true dermaplane, I’d recommend spending more on a higher quality product, but if you want to get rid of all that peach fuzz and not break the bank, this is the product for you.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"I really like how well these work. I used one as soon as I received it, but my face sort of burned for a day. Then I read somewhere that you should ensure your face is wet, place something like a cleansing cream on your skin and THEN use these. I can’t believe I didn’t think of that myself, but I tried it and it worked beautifully. And I think I got a closer shave. Then I just rinsed the blade off really well, dried it as well as I could and used it again the next time. I have used the blade 3 times and it still shows no sign of wear.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"Love this little razor!! Keeps eyebrows looking fabulous, plus you can use it all over your face to remove all the peach fuzz. Does not change how the hair grows back. Easy to use and the blades are great! Great for traveling and even comes with a cover for the blade for doing smaller defined areas. Great little beauty accessory! Face is smooth and soft afterwards. Can’t live without this thing now!! I always apply a gentle moisturizer afterwards.",5,One,B0787GLBMV
"These are great! I have had this done by professionals in conjunction with facials and have loved the results. Using these give very similar results without the expense, minus a great facial treatment though!
Use before bed, not in the morning..... My skin is always a little sensitive and oily the morning after using this but I love not having peach fuzz and old skin on my face!
There is a learning curve in regards to how to best approach all areas of you face, so watch your pressure, your eyebrows, nose and lips can may tricky to maneuver around!",5,2,B0787GLBMV
"I’ve heard the buzz around dermaplaning so last year I decide to give it a shot! I was for sure less than impressed with the suggestion of razors my friend gave me. They were too small in length and pretty dull, they also did not capture the ultra fine hair! However, I think we can all agree that they are needed in an emergency. I chose to try these out since I figured there wasn’t anything to lose. Well, I am utterly impressed by this product!!!! As soon as I glided it down my cheek I saw a color change, I couldn’t believe it! I did not have to apply much pressure, glided like butter and got rid of all the ultra fine hair 😁 It also left my skin feeling extrémela oft and plump, SO SO worth it 🥰🙌🏼",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"these were fine to use and simple to avoid cuts. but, i hate the feeling of my face now. it’s always a little tacky and super shiny now without the peach fuzz. i’m getting tiny pimples everywhere from the oiliness when it took years to get a clear face finally. i’m never doing this again, that’s for sure. to top it off, after day 3, what looks like razor bumps are forming only in the mustache area, making it obvious that it’s been shaved. what a joy. if your skin doesn’t do this or you don’t mind the feeling, these are nice enough razors. but i did order them prime 2-day shipping and it took a whole week.",3,0,B0787GLBMV
"These little shavers are both great and not so great. I used them for my face fuzz and arm hair. They got my face nice and smooth, but my arms got a bit sketchy. I don't know if it's because the shaver could only handle one use (my face) or if they are just sort of rough around the edges. I could feel a sort of scraping feeling when I used it on my face and my arms. My arms ended up with quite a few scratches. They're pretty unpleasant. They have that burning feeling, lightly bleeding on the surface. I don't think I will ever use them for anything other than my jawline. Too bulky for eyebrows and too rough for arms.",4,0,B0787GLBMV
"These are great. You can see the strips of hair that are being shaved off your face. I recommend using some kind of serum or hydrating mask both before and after using to avoid any kind of irritation or razor burn, especially if you already have sensitive skin. It’s not the razors themselves, but anywhere on the body you try to dry shave will just get irritated. My skin on my face is extra sensitive, so I wash my face first, and then moisturize before doing this. I apply aloe or some other kind of soothing product afterwards.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"I love the concept of these. I use them to edge my beard and eyebrows.

The big flaw for me is the blades are serrated.

Why they would use serrated blades that will scratch the skin and yank at the hair baffles me.

This leaves to very painful usage.

I’ve tried using with water or shaving cream but no help.

I wish they would start using non serrated blades. I may have to look for other options.",2,One,B0787GLBMV
I have PCOS and have been using a brand I got from Wal Mart for a while to shave the random hairs I would get on my face. I felt from the start that they worked but took a lot of effort and would miss some of the hairs. Now THESE... these are incredibly sharp and give you the closest shave you could want. They are borderline almost too sharp! I actually cut myself 4 times the first time using them (the edge of one I believe was over exposed). So despite being very careful and having much experience I still cut myself. So use extreme care when using. But they will give you what you want! Wow!!,5,0,B0787GLBMV
"I wish I had before and after pictures! For years I have used and electric razor on my face (one meant for women) with ok results. A friend told me about a similar product, so I decided to try this one! I am SO glad I did. I just used it for the second time on my face...I have so much white peach fuzz, and now it’s gone! Left in it’s place is super smooth skin. While using this yesterday, I looked at my arms and thought..I wonder??? Why not try it?? My arms have tons of similar white hairs on them. 60 seconds later, POOF. White hairs gone! My arms are smooth and low and behold, they are actually tan under all of that white hair!
If you are on the fence about trying this product, I say go for it! Just remember to use small strokes. It’s super satisfying seeing the fine peach fuzz fall off! I never felt like it would cut me at all.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"I was nervous to try this, and thought only professionals know how to do dermaplanning properly. Then, I rememberd I shave my body parts, I know how to shave delicate areas lol. So I watched a few videos, read up on best practice, aftercare, how to hold the blade, etc. I took my time when I did it, and it took me a little while. Now, after doing it once, I am super confident and feel really comfortalbe. I don't think it will take very long going foward now that I know how to do it. It is not a big deal at all to do this yourself! Save your time and money, skip the salon, and do this at home!",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"This both sounds and feels like I’m trying to trim my eyebrows with sandpaper, leaving my skin feeling scratched and raw afterwards. I used it to shape my eyebrows rather than pluck them so that it wouldn’t damage the follicles if I don’t like it or want to grow them back some day, and it was difficult to see what I was doing. It would be fairly easy to take too much off because of it, and yes I did use the guard that came with it, but I would probably still opt for an eyebrow razor with a much tinier blade in the future.",4,0,B0787GLBMV
"So originally I was upset because the caps on the razors were not precision covers but it turns out there is an extra cap inside the box i didnt see and upon relocating the packaging (after already using the product without it) I found it! So dont just pull out the razors guys! The precision cover is floating at the bottom of the box xD

Anyways,

I didnt cut myself and these were super easy to use! Way better than plucking- no redness and my skin is super smooth between my eyebrows which is what I wanted. 10/10",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"These things are so simple and easy to use. I had been removing my peach fuzz with a regular razor and just wasn't satisfied. This gives me such precision and accuracy that I'm not worried about taking my eyebrows off! I washed my face and dried, used the tool, then washed again and rinsed with cold water. My skin looks and feels great and I normally have SUPER sensitive skin, but I had no problems with this. Highly recommend!",5,One,B0787GLBMV
These things are awesome!! I’m new to shaving any facial hair. In the past I would bleach or use hair remover for my upper lip- but they always irritated my skin so badly! I even got burns from the last hair remover I used. I was too chicken to shave but when I saw these I figured I would finally give it a try. The reviews are so great and reassuring about not having darker hair grow in. It seems like I’ll have to touch up every couple of days but it’s so easy to do. It takes less than 5 min and it doesn’t leave my *super sensitive* skin red at all! It takes the hair off so easily and even dead skin. So happy about this find!!,5,0,B0787GLBMV
"I really really LOVE this!! I am continuing to find more and more uses for it.
First I use it for my widows peak. I’ve always hated it and started plucking it. Now I can easily painlessly shave it.
Second, I dermaplane with this. Although I don’t know if I like doing it, but this is tool for it.
Third, I use it for the blonde hairs between my brow.
There are many many more uses for this as hair grows in many places. I’ll be a repeat customer for sure!! They also last pretty long.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"I had no idea there was a way to get rid of the hair on my face. I read hundreds of reviews on multiple products and landed on these. I've had them for months and use anytime I see fuzz and I'm still on my first one. It's about time to switch it up but I found these easy to use. I recommend trying them.
Pull skin tight in the area of use to prevent cuts. I also use when my face is moist.",5,One,B0787GLBMV
"Every time I use one of these to trim up my eyebrow area, it leaves painful scratches that take a couple of days to heal. I can't see the scratches, but I sure can feel them. I've never used a tool like this before that left me feeling like I need to apply healing ointment to my skin after use. I suppose they may work better on less sensitive areas. But I wanted them for eyebrow trimming. Seriously disappointed.",2,One,B0787GLBMV
"Okay, so let me start out by saying I am obsessed with my eyebrows and eyebrow grooming. Unfortunately, I used to use tweezers and scissors to shape my brows, and it would often lead to disastrous results with me taking too much off and having thin or misshaped brows. Well, not anymore! These eyebrow razors are the perfect tool for precision brow shaping, no more problems with misshaped or overplucked brows. I recommend using this tool with the best eyebrow growth serum out there today  Pronexa Hairgenics Lavish Brows – Eyebrow Growth Enhancer Serum  (and I have tried them all)",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"Let me start by saying that I have break out prone skin. Im in my late twenties. I get hormonal breakouts and then just regular ones too. Fun times. Anyway, I also have a fair amount of blonde peach fuzz on my face. As well as acne scars and spots. I’ve tried numerous products to get rid of the fuzz, but all the electric face trimmers for women, plain razor, make me break out or stubbly. Waxing clogged my pores. So I decided to try this to get rid of the face fuzz, and help smooth my skin. I read the top review, and followed her advice. I washed my face before hand and removed all makeup. I washed my hands, cause I touched my face my keep the skin taut where I removed the hair. I did small strokes downward and washed my face again with cold water than applied my night cream, etc. and I was FLOORED by the results! My skin is so smooth! The dead skin it removed as well is incredible! My skin has never been this smooth or glowy before (without makeup). I woke up this morning and am still blown away by the results. Also, if I was gonna get a breakout id know by now, I’d feel one coming and I do not! Incredible. Will definitely buy again.",5,One,B0787GLBMV
"10/10 no joke these are amazing! I’ve never had dermaplaining done before. Not professionally or by myself. I watched a quick YouTube video on it, ordered these and went to town. I was terrified I’d cut up my face so I started off my practicing on my arm. They are super easy to use! I did both arms, both legs and my face without any issues. I do have extremely dry skin as well. After using this on my face my skin was still noticeably dry but it was soft feeling. After use I showered, used my CeraVe face wash and then followed up with CeraVe moisturizing cream. I did have some slight burning and redness but that quickly went away and my face is now super soft and hairless!",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"I always buy the Tinkle brand, but wanted to try something different. This brand is not as sharp, and you get fewer uses out of each razor---the worst part was the fact that one razor was broken. Tinkle has 6 razors in a pack, they are cheaper; this has 3 and one was no good. First time, and last time purchase.",1,6,B0787GLBMV
"I actually had purchased the super cheap version of these in the past for fixing my eyebrows not realizing I was missing an important opportunity to get a better use of them.

I'm a blog writer, and I write business blogs professionally. I was recently working on a website for one of my clients who is a cosmetic dermatologist and I learned a ton about dermablading. While I was reading about it, I learned that you can do a simpler version of it at home yourself using these little guys. I have struggled for many years as I've gotten into my thirties and forties with dead and dry skin even when I moisturize, and my foundation goes on looking rough which has been a pain point for many years. Eager to try out dermablading on my own, I hopped onto Amazon and ordered these.

I got them in the mail, cleaned my skin using a Lancome product, and then used this product to shave off the dead skin and fine vellum. I was really loving the results right away and went a little too aggro the first time and kind of irritated my skin for a few hours, but after that, I was much more gentle and cautious. I am absolutely hooked on this. I love putting on my foundation now as it goes on incredibly smooth. These little fellas were a complete game-changer. Very simple to use and cute in color and design. Thanks!",5,0,B0787GLBMV
Very sharp not sure why the review asked if this was moisturizing when it’s basically a metal serrated scalpel I must not have done this right because I ended up with crescent moon cuts in my face,2,2,B0787GLBMV
"I love these micro razors. They are great at eliminating peach fuzz, taming eyebrows and exfoliating off dead skin and smoothing your skin. I wish they were a ""little"" bit sharper. Be aware, they will irritate your skin. I have rosacea and it doesn't harm my skin, but it will be irritated overnight. I just make sure that I wash my face well after use and apply my best calming products after and my skin is fine the next day.",4,One,B0787GLBMV
"This product does the job, my face is baby smooth and my brows are clean, but the day after I razored my face, the hairs on my head kept sticking to my face (ex: baby hairs, bangs). I realized that my natural oils were exposed bc I shaved the fine hairs on my face. I found myself always having to remove and brush my hairs back from my face because they would stick to my cheek or something. Not sure how to relieve the stickiness of my face after using the razor, so if anyone has some tips, I would greatly appreciate it!
When I bought this product, I did not see a review that included this warning so I wanted to put it out there for anyone thinking about buying it! Overall, I say this is a great product. It's simple and does the job and also includes a special frame for touching up your brows! I recommend!",4,One,B0787GLBMV
"idk where i went wrong in life but these are amazing! they took all my little peach fuzz off my face and now my make up goes on sooo much better. i'd recommend using some sort of aloe gel or something when using the product so it's a little more moisturizing on your skin as your going. i didn't use anything on mine the first time and it made my skin super sensitive so, learn from my mistake. i also accidentally cut my ear while using it so be VERY careful, the blades are super sharp. i would also suggest being very cautious with any exfoliating scrubs or heavy chemical masks as your skin will be very sensitive and they might burn (as mine did). overall, the product and price point are perfect. will repurchase.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"Great for doing my own dermaplaning! There was a bit of a learning curve, with how to hold it. I was holding it with the blade mostly horizontal at first, but it should be more vertical",5,8,B0787GLBMV
"I got so sick and tired of waxing my goat haired chin that I broke down and bought this. Paid top dollar for a so-called ""dermaplaning"" sesh' at a spa for $90 only to realize I'd been had when I found these. At least I can shave myself in the morning without the harsh yank of waxing or plucking. At my age (mid 40's), I don't feel good about stressing my face with the yank of waxing and last time I was waxed at some cheap place on the corner, they burned my lip. Never again with these. It's embarrassing to need to shave my face as a woman, but things could be worse. This I can do at home discreetly without embarrassment and the price is right, too.",5,One,B0787GLBMV
"I had used the other shavers for your face that are much cheaper. After several “influencers” recommend this, figured I’d try it out. Now my husband and I both use these. They are much more sharp than the others. You pay more and get less. However, they are 10x better. It also has a part to help for eyebrows so the whole blade isn’t exposed. Which is a bonus for sure. I will spend more for this product because it works. My husband even cut himself because he didn’t realize how much better of a blade it is compared to the others.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"I hesitated trying these for a bit after they became “all the rage”, but after 5 weeks without having my eyebrows threaded (thanks COVID), I decided what the heck. They shipped and delivered quickly. There is really no skill involved; extremely easy use. The entire process (eyebrows only) took maybe 2 mins. The results were great. The only draw back for me is that the hairs come back quicker than threading or waxing....BUT, again, it is so quick and easy to use, you can simply touch up anytime. I would recommend this product and will be purchasing again.",4,0,B0787GLBMV
"I was hesitant to use this product as I have very sensitive skin (prone to breakouts) and as well am multi-racial and therefore have a lot of facial hair/peach fuzz. Fortunately, upon following the directions found on the packaging and as well looking up the best way to use this product I have to say it has been a tremendous help! I love it!

For context I used to use the Nair products for face, chin, etc. however I felt like the product never really grabbed the peach fuzz I had going on on my face. This product is precise as you control where the blade is going and can move at whatever pace you want. The product helps avoid any nicks, cuts, and works for sensitive skin. Great that it comes in a pack of three! I clean it off with alcohol after use to avoid any bacteria from growing and keep it stored in a cool/dry place. 10/10 recommended!",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"I received exactly what is pictured - Schlick brand. I love these little guys! I’m 50 and these razors help a LOT of little menopausal surprises - uneven skin, random bumps and heavy peach fuzz on my face. I had little mystery bumps on my cheek and neck and this exfoliated so well that they’re gone! You definitely need to angle the razor in the correct way or they don’t work. Maybe at about a 30 degree angle. 45 degrees does nothing. But once I got the hang of the angle, it looked exactly like like the YouTube videos of professional micro blading. Love them!",5,2,B0787GLBMV
"I love these! I used to get my brows and face waxed, then threaded, then plucked. I got frustrated with having to go somewhere every month and pay money to come out all red faced and in pain. These are perfect. No pain and my brows always look great. It takes no time at all to sit down in front of a mirror and my skin is left feeling silkly smoot. The hair doesn't grow back anymore stubbly or different than it did when I waxed, threaded, or plucked. Just make sure your face isn't too dry when you start! Otherwise you can irritate it.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
Basically a straight razor blade. I do self derma planing and have always used these types of blades. These are so sharp. I looked like I got mauled by a cat the next day. I will say I was truly impressed with how smooth my face was after but Jeesh. Not worth having the scratches,1,3,B0787GLBMV
"I have very sensitive skin and, for the most part, it did not irritate. The product is very effective and I will most likely be buying more. I have an old Conair that works better at shaving my peach fuss but this one is safer on skin, being much newer, of course.",5,One,B0787GLBMV
"My friend recommended these to me because I can’t stand waxing my face. I never knew how much I needed this in my life! I was worried because I have very sensitive skin but I use this all over my face, then use a toner and moisturizer. So far so good and no break outs! Plus, my skin is so soft and actually looks really good. Have noticed my make up going on nicer than before.",5,One,B0787GLBMV
"These work so much better than the last brand I bought! They are great for eyebrows, facial hair/peach fuzz, skin exfoliation, arm shaving, and missed spots on legs! They are sharp enough to shave my arms, but do not cut or irritate the skin. Many times I’ve used them to fix a spot I missed while shaving my legs. It works without irritating the skin or leaving razor bumps (no, I would not recommend shaving legs that way, but works on a small spot in a pinch).
It gets all of the peach fuzz/dead skin, etc off my face without irritating it. I even used it when my face was peeling from a sunburn. Helped to get rid of the peeling skin more quickly, and didn’t hurt the sensitive skin!",5,One,B0787GLBMV
Handy little things if they were sharp enough to cut hair.,1,12,B0787GLBMV
"Schick is on the left and different brand on the right. These dermaplanes do not have a guard at the end of them , I can’t even believe they would design something like this. I’ve used several different kinds and never encountered anything like this, so I didn’t think to look for that little piece covering the end of the blade (it’s extremely necessary). Have a nice little slice on the side of my nose now",1,3,B0787GLBMV
"I had never heard of shaving my face so I decided to give it a try after watching many youtube videos. I was thrilled at how easy it was and how soft my face felt after. When you put on your foundation it looks better because no peach fuzz to deal with. Thrilled with the outcome and will be doing this from now on. Give it a try, just hold your face taught and shave in a downward motion.",4,One,B0787GLBMV
"It's like a tiny, dull straight razor. Hard to use, takes a long time, and still does a terrible job. Just use a regular razor or shaver. I cannot believe I fell for this one AND I bought two packs. All six pieces went right into the garbage.",1,One,B0787GLBMV
"I’m a naturally blond woman with ridiculous random thick black hairs that grow along my chin and jaw line. I also have a blond beard of baby-hairs that makes exfoliating really difficult. Plucking them is a pain, waxing them is expensive and doesn’t always work, and I’ve tried other tools that also aren’t good at getting every hair. This has made my life so much easier! It took me a while to figure out I had to hold it at an angle to my skin rather than perpendicular. No more prickly whiskers! I can dry shave my face every night without causing irritation.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"So I was bored and two beers into scrolling through previous reviews. I usually get my eyebrows threaded, but I don't like having to ""up keep"" them every 2-weeks. I usually buy the dollar store and/or dollar general (aka low budget, obviously) brands. Those typically wear out fast. I tried out this brand tonight; was gentle. It's insane how much peach fuzz came off my cheeks, around my lips, and that annoying female chin stumble that I usually reserve for the sacred shower chronicles.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"I'm echoing another review when I say that I used to use the Tinkle brand facial razors and thought they were the best, but now that I've tried this brand, I have totally changed my mind- THESE are the best. They're amazing! They're sharp so they are very effective at getting rid of all unwanted peach fuzz, but my sensitive skin is not bothered at all. They are easy to grip. The special attachment to make it easier to go around eyebrows is an added bonus!",5,One,B0787GLBMV
These are not that good for derma planning. For some reason I got scratched multiple times while using the pink one. They are ok for eye brow but because they are so long it makes trimming my brows kind of awkward even with the guard. I will stick to my smaller eyebrow razor for my brows and my razor for my face. I do recommend dermaplanning because it because it makes your skin subtle but I dont recommend these.,3,One,B0787GLBMV
"once you get past the weird feeling of shaving your face, this product will be added into your normal beauty routine. It truly has helped the texture and appearance of my skin and allows my skin care products to work better. It also allows your makeup to apply more evenly and your skin will look radiant. People will notice! Be careful of the tip of the blades as they can make small cuts if pointed down too much.",5,2,B0787GLBMV
"I don’t know how I did without these, and dermaplaning in general for so long!
They are easy to use and figure out, shaves all the fuzz you may not have even noticed before, and exfoliates your skin all at once! I’ve never had such soft skin and people notice! Whenever I put makeup on shortly after using this, my friends comment on how good my makeup looks.
Sometimes I get a little over zealous on my chin, mostly because it scrapes off the top layers and also seems to help my blackheads want to be freed all on their own!
You simply cannot beat the price! Several friends wanted to try it, luckily I had a couple packs of these and my girls converted!
Highly recommend!!",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"These mini razors are amazing if you're looking to ditch the wax trauma and get amazing skin!
These razors are super easy to use, straight out of the package and you can do your whole face in a minute.
The razors do also sluff off a good amount of dead skin and makeup build up.
I've added these to my weekend beauty routine and my skin is better than it's ever been!
Start with a bare face,
Use these razors to remove your peach fuzz (and touch up the eyebrows while you're at it)
Apply a peel-off face mask to remove the rest of the dead skin and grossness that the razors start to sluff off.
Rinse your face and spritz with some rose water.
You'll wake up with your best ever skin!",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"Easily removes peach fuzz from all over the face. I use these about once every other week after washing my face. It makes me skin feel so silky smooth. Plus, it does NOT cause the hair to grow back in thicker, darker or faster, in my experience. If you go over the same spot multiple times during one use, it can be slightly irritating and you may notice a few bumps (beginner mistake), so I recommend avoiding that. Such a good product at a great price. I've tried other brands that do not remove the hair/fuzz/dirt anywhere close to these.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
It was my first time using one of these blades (because I couldn't justify spending the money they charge for a dermablading session every 2 weeks) and it was very easy to use. My face is incredibly soft and glowing now! Wish I would have known these were a thing years ago. I had some stubborn blackheads & pimples that were popable after using this blade. It scraps hair and dead skin off your face that you didn't even know you had. :),5,0,B0787GLBMV
"Love this gadget! I'm approaching at a different angle, I was looking for a way to speed up dissolving old scars on my face. This product is amazing! I have sensitive skin, I'm always weary of trying something new. After one week, my skin was softer and noticed my scars on my face became lighter. I'm proud to say, I don't even need to wear foundation now. A huge bonus, after the first time I used it, my face was smoother. The days I did want to use foundation, it took a lot less of the product to cover my face, it went on so smoothly and my skin just soaked it in. It felt like for the first time, my face didn't need makeup to cover flaws. I'm impressed. Will always have the Schick Silk Touch- Up on hand.",5,One,B0787GLBMV
"I bought these after an aesthetician recommended using one for getting rid of dead skin and light peach fuzz. I bought these as a cheaper alternative to the one she recommended, and the results were terrible. They are very rough and the blade gets dull almost immediately. I do not have sensitive skin, but these left my skin raw like a severe razor burn. I would not recommend these at all!",1,3,B0787GLBMV
"I found these to be totally ineffective for removing even the finest/smallest of hairs without ending up causing aggravation to my skin. Not worth the money and did not perform as hoped, or expected. There are much better products out there that will last longer, and perform better much better for a bit more money.",1,3,B0787GLBMV
"These little razors are so easy to use and omg they got rid of dead skin I didn’t even know I had! My skin was so smooth after using I could not stop touching my face. My makeup went on so nice and my skin was glowing. I went with the hair and against it. I got right up on my brows, hairline, even on my neck under my ear. Got rid of all that peach fuzz and revealed an airbrushed, rosy complexion I never knew I had! Lasted about a week before everything started noticeably sprouting again but this is definitely something I can incorporate into my weekly routine. Made me feel beautiful!",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"So after my man pointed out my peach fuzz I decided look for one of these. I came across a couple & read the reviews. I was debating between two but the other would’ve taken forever to get shipped to me so I decided to go with this one. It even came a day early. I am so surprised with how much fuzz came off my face! I had no idea all of that was on there. My face feels super smooth after using. It does feel sensitive afterwards though, which I’ve read is normal. I’m just hoping I didn’t give myself razor burn. Also definitely use the eyebrow shield for when you’re doing your brows & be very careful, I almost took out half my brow😂 I’m excited to see if there will be a difference with my make up now that I have all that hair off my face! Definitely recommend",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"I began dermaplaning at home during the shutdown. The first razor I tried were some store brand from Walgreens and they did OK. I tried these out and they are far superior. I am getting a much better result from the Schick brand of facial razors. They seem to remove more fuzz and also, my complexion feels smoother and looks brighter for longer. These are the type I will continue to use for home dermaplaning. Love the results",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"I did not really notice any exfoliating, but then I did not purchase it for that purpose. The fine peach fuzz disappeared with very little effort and after two weeks, has not grown back.
UPDATE: used it for the second time and tried it for exfoliating last night and WOW! It does work. Be careful, through, and don’t get too aggressive, I had to remove my glycolic 10% cream I put on after I exfoliated, as skin was too sensitive. This tiny tool will go with me on trips when carting around all sorts of exfoliating products is not possible. In my check-in luggage of course.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"This is one of those invaluable beauty items I'll order again and again. Fuzzy temples, sideburns, jawline, upper lip... Wherever you've got superfluous fuzz, these razors can smooth it all over. I recently ordered a battery operated ""dermaplaning"" device with a 100 dollar price tag, and I hated it. It scratched my face up and didn't get close enough to give me a smooth surface. These little gems exfoliate 10x better, and don't leave my skin irritated with stubble. Just buy these, and don't get too close to your brows.",,0,B0787GLBMV
"I love these! I gave myself razor burn using the shaver I use on my legs. First, I cleansed my face, splashed cool water on it, then applied a little almond oil to make it easy. After shaving, I used a drop of my husband's after-shave soothing balm, felt so nice! So much easier than using that big, awkward blade from my legs, and more sanitary, too. My face was so smooth, all the fine, clear hairs gone! My moisturizer and makeup went on much nicer. I definitely will keep buying these, I like how there are three in the pack, will last a long time if you keep them clean and dry.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"Not satisfied at all. I bought it for doing my brows. Waxing and threading makes me breakout terribly, plus I want my eyebrows to grow thicker eventually, so this seemed like the right choice. False. The blade is too large and awkward for the eye area. I accidentally took some of the tail of my eyebrow off today with one slight slip. Not worth it, sis! Maybe I’m just trash at using these but it never gets close enough to not leave stubble, and it robbed me of some eyebrow. I’m upset. Lol!",2,One,B0787GLBMV
"Waste of time and money for me. Didn’t do anything. I have very fine blond hair so that laser doesn’t work, but this isn’t the answer. Says Shick on front but Chinese made for Edgewell industries, so, there’s that.",1,4,B0787GLBMV
These razors from schnick are now a necessity for my facial routine! Not only are they great for eyebrow shaping but also for stubborn peach fuzz. At first I noticed small breakouts near on the areas shaved the following day but realized that I wasn’t exfoliating properly prior to using them. I’m also prone to getting ingrown hairs and found that I don’t get them with this product as long as I disinfect them with alcohol prior and follow up with witch hazel.,4,One,B0787GLBMV
"I used this for the first time on my entire face. I got sick of tweezing/waxing my upper lip (blame it on the dark-haired ancestors). It definitely got rid of all the peach fuzz on my face, but it hurt my face. So far, I haven't broken out from it or anything, but my face definitely felt raw. Granted, I used it without anything on my face, which was probably my biggest mistake. I will definitely use with some sort of face oil from here on out.",4,0,B0787GLBMV
"Definitely the best face razors out there! I’ve tried others that have more reviews and these always come out on top. They do a wonderful job at exfoliating your skin and obviously hair removal, leaving my skin looking sooo clear and smooth! The blade is nice and sharp unlike other brands with dull ones. It’s important not to over do it though and time it properly (this is general advice not product specific) because even with the best blade sometimes your skin can’t handle it. I don’t have sensitive skin but developed milia on my cheekbones from overdoing it (saw a barely noticeable hair, would shave it - dumb move) so now I just don’t do it there, people don’t talk about it enough so wanted to share. Otherwise definitely get this over others!",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"These little razors are perfect for scraping away the wee little hairs that surround a mouth, or the eyebrow area, chin as well as Dermaplaning. I have a fair complexion and these work well on my face. If you have heavy dark hair, I think it would work just as well. A gentle scraping with these razors, held at a slight angle and buh-bye fuzzy lip!",5,4,B0787GLBMV
"I absolutely love these. I used to use an electric precision face razor, but now I can never go back to those after using these kind. These are so great for a very close shave and also help exfoliate! My skin always feels so much better & more smooth after using these. Only complaint is they can leave scratches, but never any bad or noticeable for me (and I have very light skin where you can see everything).",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"It dulled quickly. The weird serrations didn't feel at all pleasant against my skin. In the grand finale of this experience, the handle snapped against my face with just light pressure. Thankfully, I wasn't injured, but having a blade snap that close to my eye was terrifying.

So, yeah, useless in general. Defective and possibly dangerous as well.",,4,B0787GLBMV
"I absolutely love this face razor. It works so good!! I’ve never used a face razor before and would use my shaver to shave my mustache which was a big mistake. But this product is definitely a game changer and you get to shave your whole face without worrying it’ll grow back thicker!! Simply use some bar soap with water, then shave!",5,One,B0787GLBMV
"Wish I bought this tool similar to what my esthetician uses in me a long time ago! It gets rid of all the little peach fuzz on your face and helps sculpt your brows painlessly. After I was done I applied my daily moisturizer and serum and my face felt like baby skin. You can definitely tell your face absorbs the moisturizing products better after being hair free. Great tool, highly recommend!",5,One,B0787GLBMV
"These are much sharper than the generic, no name eyebrow razors I normally buy. Unfortunately that meant I accidentally made a bunch of tiny nicks in my face without realizing it and now it looks like I got in a fight with my cat. On the other hand they exfoliate my face much better than the razors I used to use. Ultimately, I'm pretty pleased with them, but just be careful when you use them if you are used to eyebrow razors that are a bit dull.",4,0,B0787GLBMV
"Very sharp but not dangerously sharp. Just be careful when going around areas that aren’t too flat. If you are using these to dermaplane I recommend washing your face and then applying a serum or an oil to your skin so the blade can glide easier. Not great for overly sensitive skin, the blade will strip more than peach fuzz, it sloughs off the first layer of skin too.",4,One,B0787GLBMV
Extremely sharp and jagged blade that caused blistering on my skin along with multiple scratches. It is very harsh on the skin leaving it Extremely Extremely dry. I have been using eye brow razors for 10 years and I tried these on a whim because i ran out of my usual brand of eyebrow razor but I should have stuck with Ardell and simply not tried anything else. I truly hope that it does not scar because it peeled away the first layer of skin despite me be very careful with it.,1,2,B0787GLBMV
"I have PCOS and my body decided recently to try and grow a beard and side burns with dark, coarse black hair(I'm dramatic - maybe 20 hairs). I was pretty embarrassed about it and after doing some research I came across ""dermaplaning"". I'm extremely impatient and just picked a random tool which happened to be these. I did watch 1 video YouTube (I know, I know who only watches 1! video?!) and this chick said ""I only use my favorite serum"", so I did exactly that. Well let me just tell you, everything was fine and dandy... I was obsessed watching the peach fuzz come off w/ the dead skin cells! This product is AMMMMAAAZZZING!! BUT.... for my sensitive skin folks out there like me, after about 5 mins post shaving/shedding... my face was on fire! I had tiny cuts and razor burns(which could be possible to my technique)! Then came the itching!! I'm not saying that everyone has to or should use a cream etc,. but if in doubt....turn yourself into santa and shave away! =)",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"I'm a woman and bought this for dermaplaning my face so my makeup will set better. Holy cow, Batman. I was truly horrified by how much dead skin came off in addition to the peach fuzz. When you're using this, make sure your skin is clean and dry first of all. Hold your skin taut and then go to freaking town. Your hair will NOT grow in thicker or darker. Every woman should be using these, they're truly amazing!",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"this may be my favorite amazon purchase ever. I didn’t know what the hype was about but for five bucks, why not? I. LOVE. THIS. I always have a few hairs on my lip that just won’t go away no matter what UNTIL NOW. This product is perfect. And my eyebrows look amazing without the pain of tweezing. But my favorite part is the exfoliation factor. I rub this on my face and it is the SOFTEST IT HAS EVER BEEN.",5,One,B0787GLBMV
"I usually shave my peach fuzz with a men’s razor but this product actually get a much closer shave and it’s more precise so I could do my whole face. I washed my face first then used it. It took off dead skin as well as ALL the peach fuzz. Much more precise than any razor. I also have sensitive skin but this didn’t irritate my skin at all. No razor bumps Or irritation like I get with razors. Even though this is for the face, I also used this on my shoulders because I’ve got peach fuzz there as well and it made me feel self conscious to wear tops with my shoulders exposed. This got it all!!! Very smooth. Easy to use.",5,One,B0787GLBMV
"I originally purchased these razors to try and find an easier way to manage the not always peachy peach fuzz around my upper lip. In following the directions I gave it a shot at exfoliation as well as to shape my eyebrows.

I bought them for peach fuzz management and will continue to buy them for the ease with which I was able to clean up my eyebrows. I refuse to pay to get my eyebrows done and have strictly plucked strays in the past. This razor is a game changer for those who could care less about brow ""fashion"" and are just looking for a way to keep them even with strays in check.",5,One,B0787GLBMV
"These razors get the job done. It's easy to hold this razor at a variety of angles to properly shave any part of the face. I do run into trouble shaving the wild hairs on my lower eye brows, just because of the weird angle you have to make, but I can still get it done. These razors really shave off peach fuzz on the cheeks and anywhere, I even used them in my boyfriends haircut as a straight razor. If you have dark hair like me, you will appreciate how shaving the peach fuzz from your face brightens your complexion. I would recommend these razors to anyone.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"I bought these razors, hoping they’d leave my skin smooth but instead, I was left with a sore face with a ton of scratches and a couple of cuts. I didn’t even realize how many scratches were on my face at first—I only thought there were a couple—but then I did my skin care routine and my face started burning! It hurt so bad, I could barely get through the routine. That was when I took a couple of pictures of my face in better lighting and realized I had multiple scratches on it (on top of that, my face was red af).",1,5,B0787GLBMV
"Peach Fuzz Be Gone! Steady hands only around the eye area! Moisturize before using, be careful around your nose and use a magnifying mirror. Remember this is a razor you are putting up to your face, so there could be some razor burn if used incorrectly. I didnt expect it to help with my eye brows, but I was able to perfect them with this product. There are some product use tip videos somewhere out there on the internet...search for them before using.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"Hi ladies! I’m a 21 year old hispanic woman and so this means I have thick, dark hair... everywhere!! When it comes to my facial hair, I’ve pretty much tried it all (waxing, shaving, laser hair removal). Recently, I’ve been doing laser hair removal but haven’t gone in several months as I was out of the country and so I had to go back to shaving my face/cheek area. HOWEVER, my face is sensitive when it comes to shaving so I thought about buying this. This product works, but it’s so rough and for someone like me (with dark hair that grows super fast), it’s just not worth it. I’d literally have to do this everyday, but I might as well continue to shave it with a more sensitive friendly razed. It’s a good price and honestly I will continue to use this for my eyebrow area to get rid of some unwanted hair BUT if you’re somebody like me who’a hair grows dark and fast, maybe waxing and doing laser hair removal is the better option.",4,0,B0787GLBMV
"I like that these have a good size blade at just the right angle. I use it all over my face and it not only removes all the fine peach fuzz but a top layer of dead skin cells as well. It helped remove all the little blackheads on my nose! After using I grabbed a washcloth and washed my face as usual, then used a little sugar scrub to remove anything left. My skin feels amazing. I will continue to purchase these as needed.",4,One,B0787GLBMV
"These blades are incredible, I can finally deal with my unibrow without plucking. They worked well on the very thin peach fuzz on my cheeks, eye brow hair, and arm hair. HOWEVER, I did find they caused a fair amount of irritation on sensitive areas of my skin, and it can be difficult to do angled work (eye brow up-keep) so I did nick myself a bit, but the irritation faded after a day or so. For me the irritation is worth it because I hate plucking my brows/unibrow), but if you have super sensitive skin I would be careful.",4,0,B0787GLBMV
"These razors are multi use depending of your reason for purchase. I wanted to remove facial hair and also use this to remove dead skin. I found this was a little too long and thick to get a precise sculpt on my browns but still worked well.
I applied a thick layer of aloe moisturizer and began to remove facial hair and unwanted dead skin. This did not cause razor burn, and although the blade is sharp I did not cut my face. Plan to use once a week.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
I found these safe to use. I didn't cut myself. I am not sure about moisturizing I didn't notice that. I like the guard that helps you do your eyebrows. I have very white light skin and hair so I prefer to shave. Not sure what it would be like to use on dark hair. I shave the peach fuzz off my entire face. Don't try to save and use more than once. I think they become dull. For all the more often I have to use and all the more they cost it is not work cutting myself.,5,0,B0787GLBMV
"I have very sensitive skin & these didn't irratate it at all. My facial hair grew in much slower than when using my old shaver for women's peach fuzz. I like how easy they are to use & hold in your hand. I would however like to make a suggestion though, perhaps if the handles weren't straight they would be much easier to control on ones face. Other than this I would buy them again.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"Haven't had to get my face waxed or my eyebrows threaded since discovering these. Easy to use, travel with, and touch up when you only have a few minutes. I use these razors to remove facial hair all over my face. I was nervous that my hair would grow back faster and coarser but that hasn't been the case (even though I naturally have dark, coarse hair). You may want to try these on a small patch of skin first if you have sensitive skin but otherwise just moisturize after use. Recommended to all my friends!",5,One,B0787GLBMV
"So much better than using a regular disposable razor. Learned about this when I watched a Youtuber who has regular videos on skincare. I didn't even realize these types of razors existed. Much more effective and easy to use. Does a great job at removing soft facial hair and exfoliating, a plus I had not expected. What a difference, my face feels so soft afterward.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"I had been curious about shaving the peach fuzz I have on my upper lip and side burns for a while but was always so nervous my hair would grow back thick, dark, and course. I can tell you it certainly has not in the slightest. This blades are long and make getting rid of unwanted hairs fast and easy with just a couple swipes. I will say that they are difficult to use in the brow area due to the length of the blade, but I didnt buy them for that, so I dont see it as a downfall.",5,10,B0787GLBMV
Personally I really like these they help take the dead skin cells of my face along with the peach fuzz. Although I like them I don’t know if I would recommend to someone with sensitive skin or acne as they can cut the skin if not used properly. I also would not recommend using the more then twice because they do get dull and leave little scratches on the face. I have also used them on my legs when I didn’t feel like shaving and I was pleasantly surprised.,5,0,B0787GLBMV
"I bought these to shave my face after watching a YouTube video 😂 I randomly went with this brand and it was the best decision I made when it comes to razors in forever!! Very affordable. And easy to use on every part of the body. So far, I have shaved my faced, arched my eyebrows, my armpits and lady parts and the results were nothing less than amazing each time. I can't see myself shaving with any other tool.",5,One,B0787GLBMV
"This product works great on my skin!
I was scared to use it because I saw many negative reviews, however I decided to give it a shot and it works for me.
I would like to tell the people who are doubtful about buying this product to not be scared by the bad reviews. Understand that everyone's skin is different and reacts to things differently. Because it did a bad reaction on someone, does not mean is going to happen to you. If you are still doubtful and I understand (I was too) just try using it in just in a little section of your face and wait out a few days to see your skin's reaction. That is what I did!!!
Luckily, it works perfectly on my skin and I didn't get any bad reaction or scratch ( I was very careful because it is very sharp). It is life changing! my face feels very smooth, that i cant stop touching it.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"I waited a couple months to review this so I would really know how they work and honestly, I can’t say enough good things about them. I’ve done the creams, the little electric hair removers, and plain old tweezers, but these are my favorite by a long shot!

Not only do they actually get rid of all the peach fuzz on my face super well - without the skin irritation I risk using creams - but it’s sooooo easy, fast, and painless. Plus it exfoliates my skin! It amazes me every time I use these how much fuzz and dead skin comes off. You really only need to go over your face once every couple weeks or so, but I imagine it depends on how dark your hair is and how fast it grows. Finally something that is cheap, easy to use, and effective! For very dark haired me, these are most definitely a must have.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"First day I used it, it was amazing. Got all my hair out and smooth. But like people have commented. I BROKE OUT AND MY FACE IS RED AROUND MY MOUTH. the redness has not gone away yet but the breakout has. I do not have sensitive skin so I thot it wouldn't happen to me. I have clear skin so this is such an eye soar. Would highly recommend you shop somewhere else or at least not use it on the face. It's not worth it.",1,2,B0787GLBMV
I was so scared to try this on my sensitive skin but so far so good. Just wanted it for the little peach fuzz under my chin and along jawline. Wasn't really sure how to use it but tried pulling it along skin in various directions and did see little fuzzies on my shirt so think this did the trick. Can't say how long each one will be sharp and will last as just tried it for the first time this week but came as a 3 pack so should last awhile.,4,0,B0787GLBMV
"I wanted to try dermaplaning because my sensitive skin gets really dry in the winter and between that and the soft peach fuzz on my face, my makeup wasn’t sitting on my skin well. I initially purchased a $10 pack of tweezerman razors, and was extremely disappointed because they weren’t sharp at all and barely did anything. I decided to give it another shot and try these. And WOW. These are super sharp and took the peach fuzz and dead skin off easily. I also LOVE the eyebrow cap. I don’t think I’ll ever wax my eyebrows or upper lip again. This thing was a total game changer and only $5!",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"They do what they claim and more. Edge of your hairline, eyebrows, upper lip, works great on all. Here's a secret - they work amazing on nose hair. No more tweezing those suckers till my eyes are watering and I've set off a full on sneezing fit. This little tool works perfectly and did not nick or irritate that very sensitive area. I haven't tried yet, but I predict these would also be great on the bikini area, if one were inclined to do any fancy landscaping down there.
I am a loyal fan and will be keeping these on hand from now on.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"These worked great! Very easy to use! Just a couple things—watch a YouTube video ahead of time so you know what you’re doing. It’s super easy, but it IS a blade! Lol Also, take note that this is a form of exfoliation. I didn’t think about it and did an AHA/BHA mask right before dermaplaning, then dermarolled the next day. My skin was pretty angry with me!!!",5,0,B0787GLBMV
Absolutely love these!!!! So easy to use. Can’t really cut yourself unless you’re trying to. Don’t think I will pick up a pair of tweezers or wax strips again.,5,2,B0787GLBMV
"I have been using these for awhile now, I’ve ordered them twice already! One packet lasted me a good 2-3 months until I needed to reorder. They’re very sharp so it gets all those stubborn hairs! I like shaving my baby hairs on my face and touching up my eyebrows. The quality of these are really good! I can use each razor about 5-10 times before it gets dull. I’ve tried other brands from Walmart that were had a higher price tag and they didn’t compare to these ones! Some razors tend to rust but these don’t as long as you clean them after each use and storing them properly as well! I’ll be buying these again pretty soon!",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"Super quick and easy way to keep eyebrows under control. I had totally given up on mine because, you know, pandemic (I might have given up before that, but you don’t need to know). Anyway, it’s a self esteem booster. Super practical!!",5,2,B0787GLBMV
"It is really good for last minute or daily touch ups. I have PCOS and facial hair is a real problem to me and those helped a lot. I do have some coarse hair on my sheen so those ones still have to be plunked once in a while. For the eyebrows, I do not think they are the best even with the little cover that comes with it, but not bad for a quick touch up in btw saloon visits. Over all has a good coast benefit, but it works best on fine hair, ok on coarse hair.",4,One,B0787GLBMV
So I used this once and my face has been in agony for over a week! It is not good at all for people with sensitive skin. I had to use honey and aloe for 7 days. The 8th day I finally was able to use a vitamin C natural exfoliating cleaner with a gel hydrating serum and it’s feeling a bit better. Still have some bumps and itching.,1,3,B0787GLBMV
"I have always had peach fuzz on my face which annoyed me and caused makeup to not go on as smooth as I'd like. After surgical menopause I noticed more annoying fuzz on my face and tried these babies out... I have to say I legit love this product! Makeup now looks flawless with no annoying hairy face! If you're self conscious of the fuzz or want to have a better makeup application, I definitely recommend this!",5,One,B0787GLBMV
"I’ve been shaving my face for a long time and usually buy whatever cheap razors I come across like I did with these but I’m actually pleasantly surprised. Usually face razors feel a little rough from the safety guard and leave my skin red for a bit after but not these! These are hands down the smoothest, most gentle face razors I’ve ever used. My only complaint would be that I wish they were a tad shorter to make getting between my brows easier but I’m still sold on these and will continue to purchase. :)",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"Not sure what is “moisturizing” about these? I do not have sensitive skin whatsoever but managed to irritate my skin and ended up with a few micro cuts on my face.

I wouldn’t recommend for that reason but it did the job",3,One,B0787GLBMV
"Wonderful and has literally changed my life for the better!! I have some darker hair in the dreaded mustache area, and have been plucking and waxing those annoying things for years!! Saw these on “Momfessinals” blog and decided to go against everything that I had ever been told for 30 plus years...I decided to shave that mustache!!! It has made my life so much better! Have been doing this for about a month and only have to about once a week. If you’re on the fence ladies, go for this. Don’t waste another second waxing or plucking. I do clean the blade after each use with a little rubbing alcohol!! Get this to make your life easier.

"Is this product quick, easy and effective in taking away peach fuzz? YES. Is this product great for dermaplaning? TECHNICALLY NO. I have rather flaky, dry Colorado skin. It does pull some of the dryness off, but it also leaves a rather large amount of dry skin it just won’t catch. I nicked myself with this tool. Have a steady, soft hand when using this lil tool. The instructions are rather minimal, so I’m just lightly flicking the tool up, up and up on my face. It’s an OK product for the cost! Don’t have high expectations. I’m rather confused on the ‘Glowing Reviews’ on here. It was with $5 to give it a try. Why the heck not? It’s Quarantine and we all need a facial!",3,0,B0787GLBMV
"Amazing razors, my only complaint is that they get rusty as soon as they come into contact with any water. Like, I never used these in the shower but I'd occasionally shave my face after a shower and the next day that razor would have rust on the blade. BUT! The eyebrow add-on piece is incredible for shaping your brows. It's painless and easy to control, and gets the hair off in one swipe so you don't have to go over the same patch of skin over and over (so no irritation)! Great razors - made sure my makeup went on flawlessly.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"I have ordered this before and it was perfect. It was very sturdy and got my eyebrows looking great always. I needed a new batch so I came back to order the same Schick brand and I received something else which is so flimsy its already falling apart right from the package. Typical bait and switch. Returning, I don't trust it's safety",1,0,B0787GLBMV
I will use these FOREVER. I have PCOS which means facial hair that I do not want. Plucking can be tedious and difficult this solves everything. My makeup goes on so perfect without the peach fuzz too! Just use a light hand. The first time I used it I didn’t know what I was doing and I scrapped way too hard and it made me itch like no ones business. Use a soft touch. These are amazing,5,0,B0787GLBMV
This product is great for beginners. It’s fairly easy to use and does remove all the “peach fuzz” from unwanted areas. You have to be extremely careful so as not to cut yourself though and moisturizing afterward is a must.,4,One,B0787GLBMV
"I LOVE this product. Recently had my face dermaplaned at the esthetician’s office ($50 bucks!!) and I was shocked with the results. Of course, a few weeks later it was growing back and researched how I could do it myself. I do it on dry skin, and I take my time finding the right angle, go with the direction of the hair growth and afterwards I have hair free, exfoliated soft skin. I’ve never used anything before for my peach fuzz so I can’t compare but if the esthetician’s using them it must be effective and my experience confirms that.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"I saw this product on a Buzzfeed article and was immediately intrigued by it! I saw the awesome reviews on this product and knew I had to give it a try. They came in today and I tried them right away. I have peach fuzz on my face, some random whiskers on my cheeks and chin, and stopped getting my lip threaded. In probably 5-7 minutes of using this, my face was clear of peach fuzz, whiskers, and my little mustache. I also wanted to clean up my eyebrows using this and it was so simple! I was able to clean up a lot of the under part of my eyebrows with this product. I have very sensitive skin so I was apprehensive with this product but it did not irritate my skin at all. My skin actually absorbed my facial products better than before. I highly recommend this product to anyone! I really love this product and I do not feel myself paying for a lip or eyebrow threading ever again!",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"I would not throw the tweezers away, but this does make the eyebrows a little faster to do. I am older so I am sure that skin elasticity is a factor and I may get better with it. It is not something I am ready to use exclusively, but I will use it in conjunction with my tweezers and see if they become less necessary. I would buy them again though.",4,0,B0787GLBMV
"This is a great tool to get rid of peach fuzz. I use it all over my face and sideburns too. I like to use it to get rid of whiteheads that sometimes build up on my nose. If you have those menacing chin hairs that spring out like a jack in the box, this may not be the tool for you. Its also good for those little baby hairs around your hairline. But for your everyday little fur and fuzz, you can't go wrong. I think I'll get more of these soon.",4,One,B0787GLBMV
These are AAAAAMAZING! I am absolutely blown away by this product. I typically get a full face wax every 2.5weeks. With the quarantine I was dreading looking like a hairy beast. These more than saved the day. They left zero stubble and were so easy to use! I’ll be a customer for life,5,One,B0787GLBMV
These are perfect for taking of hair and dead skin from your face..I order them regularly because like throw away raisers they need to be replaced for the best result every few uses but you don't need to use that often. Even Kim Kardashian said hair removal on her face was her best thing she has done!! Cheap way to remove hair and dead skin cells!!,5,0,B0787GLBMV
Works great if u just wanna get rid of a little fuzz. This does not really get down to a lower level so it doesn't come back for many weeks. Both mine and my niece had ours start to come back within a week. And we had lite fuzz. However if u want it to lightly exfoliate it does provide a slight feeling of exfoliation too. Worth what I paid for sure. But will stick to my facialist to do my razor exfoliation for my facial fuzz. Bc it is a closer and better shave and exfoliation.,4,One,B0787GLBMV
"Unfortunately I, too, have facial hair (dark and light) around my lips and chin that needs removal. I used to get it threaded every 2 weeks - which worked well - except it can be painful, adds up in cost over time, may irritate my skin, and I simply have to take the time out of my day to go there. When I bought this product, I had little faith it would work. Boy was I wrong - it completely removes the facial hair and my skin is smooth with no irritation! Personally I have to use it once a week, but it takes less than 5 minutes so I have no problem with that. Be sure to point the razor in a downward fashion on your lips/chin, otherwise the blade won't remove the hair. I learned that thru trial and error. Anyway, if you have unwanted facial hair - buy this!",5,One,B0787GLBMV
Great. Worked like a charm and easy to use. I would recommend watching a few videos on how to do derma plane before actually using it. There's a trick on how you hold it for optimum results and ensuring you don't cut yourself. This definitely comes in handy during a pandemic when you can't get your brows or your upper lip waxed. I recommend!,4,0,B0787GLBMV
"Wow, these were sharper than I thought! I have purchased all kinds of razors and never experienced any this sharp so I don’t know how some reviews said they were dull. In fact, be careful and go slow until you are used to them because I nicked my face a couple of times. I will definitely keep buying these because they are worth it and don’t need to be replaced as often as cheap ones. They don’t get dull right away.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"I never write reviews. I need to be better about this. I was buying the facial razors from Sephora that also come in a 3-pack, which I was pleased with. Well, these razors blow them out of the water! So good! Using all facial razors takes some getting use to so go slow at first. Try not to go over the same area to limit irritation. I have extremely sensitive skin and feel I have nearly mastered the technique. Trust me if you’re hesitant, you can do this. Watch a video on YouTube and practice. I shave dry after washing my face. Make sure your skin is completely dry and rinse with cool water when you’ve finished. You won’t regret it!",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"I usually by eyebrow razors at Sally's, but since they are closed I decided to buy these. I was surprised at the quality of the blades for the price. They do a great job and I have not had any reaction from using them. I do have sensitive skin so that is always and issue. I will definitely buy these again.",5,One,B0787GLBMV
"These do exactly what they're supposed to do, and they do it well! I've never ordered a face razor before, but I was actually really surprised at how effective these were; they're sharp enough to get all the hair (you would not believe the amount of peach fuzz they shaved off) but not sharp enough to make me feel like I'm about to slice my cheek off. I will say they're a little abrasive, which made me worry I would get a rash -- but I didn't, so I can honestly give these five stars!",5,One,B0787GLBMV
"The razor is good for dermaplaning, you can get a few uses out of them before they dull. The end of the razor is very sharp and you can easily nick yourself. The tip is sharper than the rest of the razor so be careful and don't hold it flat against your skin. I would probably try another brand before I bought this one again.",2,0,B0787GLBMV
"I really liked this razor as it removed so much dead skin and peach fuzz from my face. I couldn’t believe how much it removed! However, after I used it for the first time I noticed I had super small cuts on my face. They were about an inch long and SUPER fine, like a paper cut almost. That was the only downside. I put triple antibiotic cream and waited for my face to heal before applying make up onto it. My face was very itchy after use, as well. I’ll just be more careful next time I guess.",4,0,B0787GLBMV
"I was honestly terrified that I would cut myself by not holding it right, but I didn't! AND my skin has never looked better. I used it last night all over my face and today, my skin looks so smooth, and it's truly glowing. I feel like it allowed for my skincare products to work so much better overnight, too. I'll likely be repurchasing once I finish this set.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"I wanted to like these but every. single. time. I used them I ended up with a scratch somewhere. I didn't even realize it was happening until later when I'd look in the mirror and see a red scratch. On the plus side, they're super sharp.",2,One,B0787GLBMV
"I was testing this in comparison with the tinkle product. I almost didn't because the Schick name brought the Schick surcharge and I am all about saving money. This little shaver is fantastic! What makes it my new go-to is that the safety guard over the blade has much finer teeth. With tinkle, the gaps between the teeth are much wider and the metal tooth more substantial as well. Much better for a delicate touch.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"They require me to repeatedly make the same move, closer & closer to my skin. They do not cut well ... Not hair anyway .. but because I couldn't get it to catch simple eyebrow hair it nicked my skin. I don't like this product at all.",1,2,B0787GLBMV
"I bought these for the peach fuzz on my face! They are easy to use and work really well.
After I used it I applied a moisturizer and it did sting a tad, so I decided to try a more natural moisturizer the next time and it was better. My makeup went on really smooth after using this on my face!!
I absolutely LOVE these! I had to order some for my daughter because she tried them and loved them too- and she really loves the attachment to help with eyebrows!!!
Winner!!!!",,0,B0787GLBMV
"I'm a 43 year old woman and have recently discovered the increase in facial hair as we grow older, thanks to an increase in testosterone and decrease in estrogen. Sigh. I used to wax, but it's painful and I have sensitive skin. I pluck, but also painful and you have to do it constantly. I found this tool and wow! The first try it was super easy to use and I couldn't believe how much fuzz and hair it took off my face. My skin feels smoother and it was painless. You have to really be trying in order to cut or scratch yourself with this tool. I was really impressed and will be using this regularly as part of my de-fuzzing routine. Highly recommend, especially if you are like me and are sick of waxing, have sensitive skin and annoying facial hair!",5,0,B0787GLBMV

 So I think there may be some user error here. I tried it on my arm first just to feel it and it was fine! I found that I had to hold it at a particular angle so it wouldn’t snag or hurt. So I tried my face next. It got the hair off great! Butttttt then my whole face was bleeding. I’m not sure what I did wrong. Maybe the angle was wrong? I did it in the direction of the hair growth. Either way it left me with some scars. I really hope it goes away soon. It does get the hair off though!",4,0,B0787GLBMV
"Great price for 3 of these blades. Easy to use after watching a few YouTube videos. The results are amazing. Honestly so happy with the way my skin looks after using this. I just cleansed my skin, the blade with dettol, and then started away with the fuzz on my face. Really impressed, and now I will no longer use my facial trimmer and stick to this for better, smoother and more easier results. Just please be careful when using, as I did cut my neck a little.",5,0,B0787GLBMV

"If I could’ve given this product 0 stars, I would have. The blade is so incredibly dull that it doesn’t get rid of ANY hair! Not peach fuzz, not eyebrow hairs, not upper lip hair, nothing! It’s also very irritating to the skin. DO NOT BUY! Awful product, I imagine any positive reviews were paid for or otherwise incentivized!",1,3,B0787GLBMV
"I really wanted to like these, but my skin just doesn't. I made sure to clean my face thoroughly and disinfect the blade with rubbing alcohol before use, but I got little painful breakouts around my lips and jaw line. I tried twice, used at a 45 degree angle, and made sure not to press too hard but the result was the same both times. My skin is fair but not usually sensitive, so I was not expecting this reaction.",3,0,B0787GLBMV
"I saw these featured in a Korean beauty routine video and was surprised to have actually never seen these before. I ordered a pack and gave them a shot, thinking my skin might be a bit too sensitive but I think these are just right. I use them for shaping my brows as well as exfoliating. For both uses it works great! I can't say I experience a ton of redness when using this, just don't overdo it and you should be fine. Try them!",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"I had acne prone skin and wanted to try and take some excess dead skin off. These are great for that. I didn’t notice too much peach fuzz which makes me think they aren’t too sharp (other razors I’ve used on face take off a lot). However I did see lots of dead skin come off . My face feels cleaner and less oily after using this to dermaplane . For reference I cleanse ,tone , and then wait until face is totally DRY to use this .",5,0,B0787GLBMV
This little razor works perfectly to even remove 1 short hair very precisely. I used to use a razor and would occasionally cut myself. The exfoliating part refers to the blade lightly going over your skin as your remove hair. Very pleased with this little tool. I wonder how it will work in the long run compared to using tweezers.,5,0,B0787GLBMV
"How did I live this long without knowing about this tool? Read about it in an article and figured I give it a try. Hands down amazing! ""Shaves"" and exfoliates face hairs and is so smooth. I would recommend showering after- I went to the gym and got sweaty, not a smart move. But after washing my face I was fine. Short story: buy it!",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"These are amazing! I’ve always had a few fine chin hairs in one spot and they drive me crazy so thought I’d give these a try. Holy cow, it works so well. You don’t even feel it on your skin and takes even the finest hairs off. Worked so well I tried it on my eyebrows, which I often neglect. Took about 30 seconds to perfectly shape my eyebrows, remove all the little stray hairs that pop up between the side of your eyebrows and hairline. Removes them close enough that it looks like they were pulled or waxed. Highly recommend!",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"I have received dermaplaning treatments at a salon a few times, but these treatments can be expensive. Then, along comes the Schick Dermaplaning Tool for easy at-home dermaplaning! This is the perfect cost-effective tool to scrape off dead skin and peach fuzz from your face for that smooth, easy glide of makeup application. It really makes a world of a difference! This tool is just sharp enough to get all of the gunk off your face without being intimidated taking a blade to your chin and cheek area. I think this is a great at-home alternative to salon dermaplaning- easy to use with great results!",5,One,B0787GLBMV
"I was worried these would make me grow thicker hair (aka a beard and mustache), but nonetheless I am still a beardless lady. I recommend using only after you have freshly washed your skin to avoid irritation, and you will find yourself as smooth as a baby’s bottom. I have used them mostly on my face and brows but also on my pits and bikini line in a pinch.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
I needed this for hair on my upper lip. Works beautifully. Very sharp. I love that it comes with an eyebrow cover. Ive touched up my own eyebrows which means i can go less to get them done. My hubby needed a single razor for his beard and asked to use one of these in a pinch and he loves them too so i've just given him his own lol. I'm only using it for my upper lip and i make sure to clean and dry it before i put it away so it lasts a good long while. I'll be buying more to keep stocked up.,5,0,B0787GLBMV
Was hoping to use these for baby soft skin. I have seen so many people talk about gently shaving the hair on their face to exfoliate skin & leave skin baby soft. Unfortunately for me it over exfoliated the skin on my face & left it very rough & irritated. It has also caused it to become very sensitive. I should have known better then to attempt to do it on my own. I always regret doing stuff like this to my skin! I should of known to leave it to the professionals.,1,0,B0787GLBMV
"I love this razor. I use it to shape my eyebrows, upper lip, & the peach fuzz on my face.
I used to tweeze my eyebrows and wax my upper lip, but this is so effortless and easy.

My son also used this razor as a preteen when he first started getting facial hair.
I have bought cheaper razors in the past, but they get dull much faster.
This is my favorite brand.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"I paid an exorbitant amount of money for a facial to do this exact same thing! I was absolutely shocked that an ""over the counter"" tool would remove as much buildup and hair as the facial. My face felt wonderfully smooth after I was finished, and it took hardly no time. I can't wait to do it again (and probably get better and more precise!).",5,2,B0787GLBMV
"They work really good, I originally bought an off brand version of this that was just so dull & felt like it was just pulling hairs out, instead of actually shaving anything, so I almost gave up on the whole idea.

Be careful though because the blade is super sharp, so try not to put too much pressure on it because I did in some areas on my forehead and got a couple small spots that look like razor burn.",5,0,B0787GLBMV

Highly recommended.. so far 6 of my friends have bought these after I told them and they saw the result :),5,0,B0787GLBMV
Got this since my eyebrows were out of control and I couldn't get them done like usual. So glad I did! Its easier to use than I thought. Worked exactly how it was supposed to. I ended up shaving my whole face. Its so soft now but I would recommend using moisturizer. As well as cleaning your face before. Makes it a lot easier. I had to use my tweezers a little bit for the really precise spots but that guard helped a lot. 100% recommend this product!,5,0,B0787GLBMV
"I've used other brands of these and loved them for a quick faical exfoliator, so I wanted to try these seeing as the razor seemed a little bigger then the ones I've bought prior. The egde of the blade is not covered by the plastic so it left scratch marks and even cut a couple areas on my face. It irritated it tremendously. It seems sturdy and intact well, but the make of it just wasn't working for me. You really have to hold this in the perfect position to not have the end of the blade touch your skin.",3,0,B0787GLBMV

My skin is not irritated when using these and I've used one for a long time and it still isn't dull. Great buy!",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"I used to use the Tinkle razors for my face before switching to these. The Tinkle razors were fine, nothing wrong with them, but once you switch to these you won't go back.

"Love these little shavers! They are perfect for removing the peach fuzz on my face, as well as performing as an exfoliator for raised dry skin.

They are not that sharp and so if you aren't someone with practice and a steady hand, these are a good choice for you.",3,0,B0787GLBMV

I have been looking into these razors for a while now and I don't know why I didn't buy them sooner! These razors are amazing an so easy to use!! I read some reviews that said they hurt and left cuts but I have had no issues with them so far! These tools making shaving and trimming eyebrows so much FASTER and EASIER!

"At first glance, these razors seem of high quality. For context, I have been dermaplaning at home for 5 years now. I started off using Tinkle disposable razors (purchased on Amazon) and also tried some I picked up at BB&B. Never before have I nicked my skin while using the Tinkle or BBB razors (BBB razors were overpriced and dull IMO, would not buy again). I find these razors to be super sharp and effective HOWEVER upon first use I nicked my skin 5 times. I've never had this issue with the Tinkle razors. Not sure I would buy these again, probably will go back to Tinkle when it's time to repurchase.",4,0,B0787GLBMV
"Decent for the price, single use, easy to hold and just got the job done.

"I was disappointed in these. They don’t appear to be as sharp as some brands I’ve used in the past. The hair on my face doesn’t come off easily, it almost feels like it gets caught on the blades. It should work smoother. They probably work okay for small areas, but not much for the whole face if you want to remove the peach fuzz.",2,0,B0787GLBMV
I do Dermaplaning in a dermatologist office with a scalpel and this is much better! When it’s sharp it’s easier to glide ! Took me 5 minutes for my entire face. My only suggestion is to make them a little longer. For the proper hold and the correct angle of the blade it would help if it were a little longer . But for the price?!? I’ll be fine !!😬🙂,5,0,B0787GLBMV
These do take off dead skin and peach fuzz. I used it on my face just under the side burn area. My biggest fear was that the hair would come back prickly and feel like I shaved. When my hair grew back it did sort of feel prickly but the hair is so fine that it’s hard to notice. I think I will continue waxing instead.,5,One,B0787GLBMV
I love using these to keep my brows clean. Since the threading station has been closed I have been able to maintain my brow shape and look. I think I may do this from now on to save money as I am getting the same results without pain. The only negative thing I would say about this is sometimesYou get Some small cuts but I get that with threading as well.,5,0,B0787GLBMV
"These are great! At first, I didn’t think they were working because I was holding it on the wrong angle... and pressing too lightly.

I use this to dermaplane about once every couple weeks. They have come in handy this Quarantine for helping my keep my eyebrows and lip touched up.

These are definitely meant to be used one time each.,5,0,B0787GLBMV
Ladies - YOU NEED THESE. I seriously just got them an hour ago and can’t begin to tell you how obsessed I am. I used them to shape my eyebrows and woOW. They’ve never looked so good.

"I've used cheaper drug store version of this item before and liked it, just needed to replace because of dull blade, so I purchased these. I just used one for the first time and it got so much hair and dead skin off my face . I kept staring at blade in awe at how much dead skin it actually removed. I keep up on exfoliating my face so I was really shocked so much came off from this razor. I do recommend using on wet skin, because I did get some skin irritation like a razor burn but not extreme or painful. I like that the head of razor area is longer than other brands because you are able to cover larger amount of area at a time. I did go over areas a few times which probably didnt help with redness of my skin, but I wanted to remove peach fuzz and dead skin. I would recommend to friend.",4,0,B0787GLBMV

Best tool for removing dead skin! My skin gets so dry and I’m constantly having to remove dead skin with facial scrubs which don’t work too well for me.

They work well for removing peach fuzz on the face and straggler chin hairs but they are not good at removing hair not on the face. Be very careful, I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because even if you are gentle they can still be a bit painful to use.",4,0,B0787GLBMV
"Wow! I have been kinda of self conscious about the peach fuzz on my face as a woman. My makeup never seems to go on correctly and moisturizers and toners seem to sit atop my skin, rather than being absorbed. I’ve known about derma-planing, but I’ve always been afraid to try it myself; worried the hairs would grow back more noticeable. I went ahead and made the purchase 2 days ago and just received this product. I had planned to only do a small portion of my face....15 mins (or less) later I completely and successfully did my entire face and WOW! My skin has never felt and looked so smooth! Just buy it!",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"I use these for trimming up my eyebrow area when I don't feel like plucking. I've tried lots of different brands that I've liked, but these are excellent. The pointed tips make getting into smaller areas quite easy, and I love the precision cover it comes with. These stay sharp after lots of uses and are a great value. I'll definitely repurchase these.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"After use, not only did I get a small rash, but for weeks after my skin felt rougher then ever...I they then away after one use...",1,3,B0787GLBMV
"Have you ever shaved your legs and realized you missed a spot and it irritates you? Or have you noticed some hair on your upper lip that you want to get rid of?

This product completely solves this and other related body hair issues with ease! I travel a lot and go to conventions and this is the best thing to have in your purse if you need a touch up on your bikini line, legs, face, whatever! Highly recommended!",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"I am in the process of hair removal via laser which means no more plucking, these have saved me from looking like a man. Word of advice they are incredibly sharp, I accidentally cut my ear and didn't even know it till I was bleeding. They come with a guard for doing areas you don't want the full blade. Great for facial hair removal and exfoliating",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"All I can say is since I've been using this product, I can just feel my skin cells sloughing off a lot easier with this tool. I use a product that also exfoliates my skin, so with this product, the two of them make a good pair. I'm 47 years old, so I'm doing what I can to keep my skin from looking worn. This tool just helps speed up the exfoliating process. Applying my lotion afterwards really makes my skin feel super soft. Yes, I would definitely recommend this product! :-)",5,One,B0787GLBMV
It’s a really really good product. I wish I knew about this earlier because it takes out all your hair and doesn’t leave any marks at all. May make you break out but not a lot at all. I had both this now both my other sisters use it too. They love it as well. It especially amazing when shaping your eyebrows. I’ve gotten SO many COMPLIMENTS.,5,0,B0787GLBMV
"Suits the purpose of a quick face touch up and getting those little white hairs. While I read review of people cutting themselves, I actually wish the blade were a bit more sharp and smooth (the reason for only 4 stars). It seems a little purposefully course, which I can understand if idiots get in a hurry and then complain of cutting themselves.",4,One,B0787GLBMV
"BUY THEM!
I got my face microbladed last year and liked the results but not the price. After letting my peace fuzz grow back I found my face to not take makeup well and not look as smooth anymore. I decided to try these after months of back and forth on if they would work well. Finally bought them and let me tell you they are they best. They were supper easy to use. Just hold your skin taunt, angle the blade and run it along in sections. Best 5$ ever spent",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"So I watched Jaclyn Hill's youtube video where she used these and I was afraid to try it, but I have a LOT of peach fuzz so I went for it and I will NOT be going back. These are so easy to use and work very well. My foundation goes on much nicer when my face is smooth. My concern was that the hair would grow back darker or stubbly, and that hasn't been the case. It also takes a long time to grow back so I shave my face very infrequently",5,0,B0787GLBMV
This item works if you figure out what you are doing. I had to search YouTube for some help. There is no instructions with this product. Overall it does what I needed which is help with excessive facial hair. I have PCOS and I am hairier than average. This helps me to control my chin hair. However with having sensitive skin it tends to aggravate my skin. So expect some redness and irritation.,3,0,B0787GLBMV
These are by far the best facial exfoliating razors I’ve found. Don’t buy the cheap 50 pack of throw away razors. The blade on this stays sharp for a very extended amount of time and is absolutely made better. There is no comparison. Make sure to use it at an angle and be careful around your eyes.,5,0,B0787GLBMV
"I have very sensitive skin and fine hair. waxing always leave me with bleeding/scars and other methods do not really take off my skin hair since it is very thin and fine.
I found this product on a make up influencer page and thought to give it a try. and it was OMG! SUPER EASY and fast. trims all the hair in my skin and does not leave it with any marks! Also, the price is good",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"I bought this product originally to fix my wonky eyebrows from a plucking accident and having to let them grow out to look normal. It worked so well for my eyebrows that I finally have my natural arch back. After telling my mom about them she asked if they would work for dermaplaning and they do! I even had my elbow slip and did not cut or mar my face but all the fuzziness was gone. Beware, your skin may be dry afterwards so use a good sensitive facial lotion or toner to fix any aggravation.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"Great for removing dead skin on feet during pedicures. Helps get in smaller areas missed with pumice stones. Best used on wet skin, for sure.

I was very leery of using this on my face, but I did try it. I doubt I’ll continue to use for this purpose. I nicked my nose and am too afraid of cutting myself worse.",4,0,B0787GLBMV
Not sure why they ask about moisturizing I haven’t notice any of that. Have used these more than several times now. They are okay-ish but wondering if there are better ones out there to try since I’m not completely satisfied with these after always hearing good things about this type of tool,4,0,B0787GLBMV
"I have been using these on my face for derma planning and love the results. I decided to give it a shot on my dry calloused heels ( not the same one used on my face, of course!) I used it after my shower and my heels are so smooth now! It worked amazing! I love these!",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"OMG, I love these! I was a little nervous to use cause I really didn't know what to expect, but I was surprised how easy they are to use. As I'm getting older I see more hair on my face I tried different products but this by far is my favorite. A public personality posted theses on Instagram and this is how I found them on Amazon. Glad I bought them.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"Honestly, these are amazing. I’ve struggled with excess facial hair forever- in less than 5 minutes all was gone and my skin looked and felt smooth and radiant. I apply lotion to my face and shave against the hair growth (pkg. says with it, but that didn’t work for me ). Hair does not grow back darker; that’s a myth. I’ve had actually had people tell me that I look “glowy.” Great product!",5,0,B0787GLBMV
These are truly awful! I bought them to touch up little hairs here and there on my face. Not only do they not work but they are super rough on your face! I had a rash all over from one time use. And honestly all my peach fuzz is still there! Save yourself the $5 and just tweeze or wax!,1,0,B0787GLBMV
"I have sensitive, acne prone skin & this is amazing for getting rid of dead skin cells & peach fuzz. I have blonde hair, so I was surprised to see how much peach fuzz I had when I did this the first time. Be careful when doing this because it’s VERY sharp & I did cut myself the first time. You only need to do it once a month & I recommend watching a YouTube tutorial before using this if your haven’t done this on your own before. Make sure to do this on fresh clean skin & lightly cleanse/ moisturize your skin afterwards too. DO NOT exfoliate your skin at all with other exfoliating cleansers/ tools for AT LEAST a week afterwards. You only need to use this tool once a month.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"I have used this type of tool, but not this brand. When I opened the package and removed the protective cover from the tool I chose, the plastic part of the actual tool broke off and the razor flew out, which of course I had to crawl around and look for.

I cannot recommend this product; however, I was issued a refund immediately and the Amazon chat agent was prompt and helpful.

Neither the website or IOS app has an option for me to submit a photo.",1,0,B0787GLBMV
"I have tried other brands dermaplaning tools but none work as well as these! They are sharp and precise and are very easy to use. They leave your skin feeling smooth and exfoliated while allowing your makeup to apply evenly without caking and serums and products to soak in faster and deeper. I have nothing but good things to say! They are great for little touch ups and easy to transport. The only thing I suggest is pulling your skin taught when you are using them, if you do not, you risk the chance of cutting yourself.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
Ugh! Cut my face in 3 spots. Went back to look at reviews and they mentioned that the blades are uneven. Guess that’s what I got. So disappointed! Apparently not all brands are same. Razor burn. Now I’m paranoid to try a different brand and will probably give up on the facial hair removal.,1,One,B0787GLBMV
"So glad a friend told me about these! I was paying $85+ for a dermoplane before I discovered I could do it on my own (minus the facial). In fact, the last dermaplane i received the esthetician used the same tool!! Be careful when you use it as it can cut your skin and watch a you tube video on how to do it the first time. I love my results and love how often I can use it.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"I’m the kind of person who loves having smooth legs and I take extra care to make sure my upper lip, chin, etc. are free of stray hairs. When I first bought these, it was a GAME CHANGER. I keep one in my makeup bag or purse usually, so if I’m out and about, and notice I missed something- it’s gone right then and there! This little razor works so well! Highly recommended!",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"It does it job, good quality and sharp gets rid dead skin and hair as you can see all the dead skins that feel into my leggings, I accidentally cut my self but that was my fault not the razor, but I was I done with and washed my face while trying to put moisturizer it does sting just for like 1 sec.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"Sharp. They're the sharpest I've used for the price. Way sharper than revlon brand or any other drug store brands. Yet, delicate enough to not cut yourself easily. The price is great. They don't stay sharp after using them, but they're meant to be one time uses. Small enough, and shaped well enough, to use easily on the face.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"I love this product. It really does get the job done, but it has cut me a lot of times. you have to be soft and gentle with it, or you will cut yourself. I have cut myself at least 3 times on my face and legs. but if you are gentle slow and soft, you can get rid of your hairs and leave without any cuts. it can definitely cause a lot of damage though since it is an actual blade on your face.",4,0,B0787GLBMV
"I went on a camping trip for two days and shaved off my unibrow and extra unwanted facial hair, please know that I have thick wavy hair, and my hair grows fast. I had a lady who microbladed my eyebrows and recommended this type of razor for clean ups. I also recommend it because my face looks clean but please be careful if you are using it for the first time because it’s really sharp and I accidentally cut my face a couple times so please have your mom or friends help you if you are unsure.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
Make sure you have an oil base on before use otherwise you’ll agitate sensitive skin/ give yourself razor burn! I learned my lesson the hard way unfortunately but I do really love these razors for that facial peach fuzz. I think they do a great job with dermaplaining (removing the dead skin and hair). The razors are easy to use and it’s great it comes in a multipack!,5,0,B0787GLBMV
"I liked the way it handles but overall it just wasn't working as well as I wanted it too. I like that it's a safe product, even when shaving a little less carefully there were scratches instead of cuts, but it feels like I still have stubble. My skin somewhat sensitive and I didn't have any reaction. A few bumps from where I was practicing and was not shaving the correct direction. User error entirely.",3,0,B0787GLBMV
I have bought these several times! They are great for peach fuzz on the face and have lasted me forever. The last package I got though I didn’t hold right and scratched my face so be careful when using these are they can cause ur face to get scratched and bleed if not used the right way.,5,0,B0787GLBMV
"I have used multiple brands of personal razors like this over the last few years and so when it was time to order new ones, I decided to give this brand a try. I used the first out of the package this morning in the shower and on the second swipe along the side of my face (side burn area), I cut myself. Not a scratch, but a true cut an inch or so long that bled for several minutes. I was using the razor the same way I have always done, but this one has a very sharp leading edge that i was not expecting and do not feel is safe for use on the face. These will be going in the trash!",1,0,B0787GLBMV
"These are way too big and chunky to be used on the face, especially near eyebrows. I have used many different blades to remove fine hair and clean up by eyebrows. These sliced by face terribly. They performed to the equivalent of taking a jagged tin can to my skin. Awful!",1,0,B0787GLBMV
"These are great. Makes your skin feel so soft. I know people say using these makes your hair grow back darker, but this has not happened to me. I like using these bc I use tretinoin so sometimes my face gets very dry. I use these very gently to get some of that dead skin off. Don’t be too harsh with these though, and definitely don’t use it everyday. I use them once every couple weeks. And be especially careful if you’re on any sort of topical medication like me. Stop using the razors if your skin starts to become very sensitive and react.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"Save yourself a ton of money on threading and get these guys. Removes both peach fuzz and darker hair. They are not difficult to use, but of course you still have to be careful because you can cut yourself if you don't pay attention. I always wash my face before using just in case I nick myself, and I always moisturize afterward. Leaves my face super smooth.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"I have tons of peach fuzz and always have! I was afraid bc of the old wives tales, but I loved this. I do have very sensitive skin so my face felt hot and I did have a few hives (I react to friction). However, it did what it was supposed to and my face and brows look great!",4,0,B0787GLBMV
"I’ve used Tinkle to dermaplane for almost a year now, but I feel they were good for a single shave, and never for a second. These Schlick brand blades are easy to hold, easy to use, can be used a few times per blade (after sterilizing). The price is great, the shipping is quick. I’ll only be buying this brand for the foreseeable.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"Have only used one out of the pack, maybe that one is defective ? Felt rough on my skin when using and I wasn’t pressing hard. Left micro scratches on my face that I didn’t see at first but were slightly bleeding about 5 minutes. On second and third use I was scratched again and didn’t it see till a small scab was showing the next day. I like the idea and ease of use and what it does. Just hope the others in the package don’t leave scratches since I like the product. Great for traveling.",3,0,B0787GLBMV
"I love these!!! Better than another brand I’ve used. This one allows you to get flatter to the skin. Careful not to apply too much pressure, or else you can cut yourself. These allow me to dermaplane my face before my facials. It leaves my skin smooth and clean! It also saves me money at the Dermatologist’s office! I did recommend this product and will purchase again.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"Wow, so I’m really impressed. I’m sad that I just now discovered this product! It cuts the hair down, it even feels lower than a shave. It’s soo easy to do my eyebrows with this! Seems like it even takes off the dead skin. My one complaint is that on some areas, my skin burns a little afterward. However, it goes away.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"Amazing! I tend to grow a decent amount of peach fuzz as well as a few coarse, black chin hairs. My face is now hair free, feels soft, and I ditched a LOT of dead skin! My skin looks brighter/definitely has a glow.

A word of caution: I did scratch myself on my nose and cheek upon first use. The scratches are very superficial and I’m sure they will go away in a day or two, but go slow and make sure you hold the razor at a proper angle to avoid any accidental nicks! I think this had more to do with me being careless than the razor being at all dangerous.

Also, be careful over moles. Personally, I’d avoid them all together but to each their own!

Great buy, great price! 5/5.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"My boyfriend hates when I use tweezers on his eyebrows so I bought these and it so much easier to do his eyebrows. And great for unwanted hair on face, would recommend using coconut oil on skin or baby oil before using cause it is not the best for sensitive skin and I have super sensitive skin.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"Worked well after I figured out the angle and pressure needed to do it right. Made my face smooth and hairless. I do not use these anywhere near my eyebrows though. Had a friend the accidentally shaved off half of her eyebrow. It was hilarious, but didn't want to make the same mistake. Be warned!!",4,0,B0787GLBMV
"I used to get annoyed by the baby hairs around eyebrows and the light peach fuzz all over my face, but thought all the ways to remove it weren’t worth it. I bought these on a whim initially to do eyebrow touchups, but it is also amazing for light skin exfoliation. A few light strokes and my skin looks and feels smoother. Less than $5 and one of the best beauty tools I’ve purchased all year.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
This is my first time trying A product like this. I was worried i would cut myself but it’s very easy to use on my face. However I can not use it to shape my eyebrows bc it sometimes snags and then jumps a little further than I expected. I feel like I would accidentally temove too my of my brows. But it works great to remove peach fuzz and leaves my skin very smooth.,5,One,B0787GLBMV
"Two products in one. Takes off the facial hair while taking off dead skin. My face felt so soft after using these. Down side? You are just shaving off the hair at the surface so you aren't getting the roots. Hence, you will have to use more often. I can go a few days before I have to use again. But it only takes a quick second and bam, your face is baby soft again! I buy these often. Great for the price!",5,0,B0787GLBMV
They work fine for one swipe- then they have like a small fracture in the blade and you spend the rest of the time micro cutting your face so you are all scratched up and ridiculous looking when all is said and done. That was my experience with this razor...,1,0,B0787GLBMV
The hair on my face I can barely call peach fuzz. I have always been self conscious about it because I have dark hair on my face. The hair grows medium- coarse in some areas but is apparent when I put my hair up more. I’ve used removers and wax but they always left my face covered in rashes and pimples. I just used this tool and I have to say I am happy so far. I used it out of the shower and my skin is very dry already so I had to put some coconut oil to make the blade run smoother. I have little irritation. I can see my pores and my face is actually a shade lighter in those areas now. I’m waiting to see what the hair grows back like. I put aloe after I was finished and it’s like brand new skin. It was great at taking the hair away and also dead skin.,4,0,B0787GLBMV
"Wow!!! I saw that the product had such great review, so I was excited when it arrived... Guess what.... the piece of crap could not even shave any piece hair off my eyebrow, from any angle! What a waste of money! Already went in the trash!",1,2,B0787GLBMV
"I don't agree with the package claims at all. They do remove hair, but certainly not in an 'easy to use' way. I typically don't have sensitive skin but using this razor left me dried out scraped up for the most part. It certainly is possible that these could work as described... Though I'm not about to try them again to find out. Not worth the scrapes.",3,0,B0787GLBMV
"I did not like these at all. I only gave them 2 stars because they do exfoliate as they claim, but a person could use the edge of a credit card and it would feel the same. They did not take off my peach fuzz at all. I threw them out and will buy another battery operated facial trimmer thing.",1,2,B0787GLBMV
"I have the Michael Todd dermaplaning tool, it cost about $80, and these knock that expensive device out of the park. It gets all the peach fuzz and takes away the dead skin so easily. Someone told me I looked radiant after dermaplaning with this, which never happened with the Michael Todd device. Save your money and get this",5,One,B0787GLBMV
"I have always got my eye brows professionally waxed, but I just don’t have the time to go as much as I need to. I figured for $5 it wouldn’t hurt to try, plus I could use this for upper lip hair. Best purchase I have made!!!! My eye brows looked just as good as when I go to get them waxed for 1/4 of the cost. I used it dry and it worked like a charm, with no issues. I am glad I took a chance and tried them out.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
I fell for the hype after years of using my facial electric razor because I thought it was possible these may get more hair faster. No they do not. No they are not for sensitive skin. These work but I don't prefer them and my skin had bumps the next day that I don't get when I use my electric razor.,3,0,B0787GLBMV
"Love them!! I initially ordered them for dermaplaning, which they do an amazing job of. But they're also great for getting rid of random facial hairs, cleaning up your eyebrow arches, etc. I'm really happy with these. My skin felt so new and smooth and fresh after just dermaplaning with these one time. Definitely make sure to moisturize afterwards though, of course",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"These dermaplaning razors are an amazing purchase. They work perfectly for taking care of upper lip hair and around the eyebrows. They are very intuitive, easy to use, and are nearly impossible to nick yourself with. I use these about once a week, and one razor will truly last you months. They are so gentle and leave the skin very soft. Highly highly recommend for anyone who wants a quick, easy, gentle way to manage any unwanted facial hair.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"I had no idea what a difference these would make on my skin! It feels so smooth and all the peach fuzz on my cheeks is gone. You do need to be careful to not accidental get hair you'd like to keep (the blades are quite wide), and it took a me a few minutes to figure out how to hold them at an angle to really get the peach fuzz, but once I did I was very impressed. Will definitely continue to use these.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"I love this product. It's very satisfying to have such smooth skin after using it. I recommend this product as much as possible when talking to people. I almost bought cheaper ones in bulk but saw some reviews about some of the blades being defective. I'll stick to quality brands like this, better safe than sorry! I've bought these quite a few times now, I will not buy another brand.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"Wow! I had no idea I had that much fuzz on my face! I definitely recommend the product. Be very careful! It’s super sharp. I nicked a very small spot on my ear because I was moving too quickly. Other than that, I had great results. I recommend look at videos and tips online by professional on how to hold the razor and use it appropriately to not cut yourself.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
These are extremely sharp! I barely went over a few parts above my eyebrows and had little cuts on my face the next day. You have to be extremely careful not to press hard against the skin. I'm not sure if the blade was cutting me or the little metal part the covers the blade but either way be very careful. It does the job otherwise.,4,0,B0787GLBMV
I used beauty supply to dollar tree razors and I have to say these brushes are top of my list right now! No joke I shaved about my lip..side Burns and it was smooth not only that my skin has not been irritating me ! Usually I will shave using natural products so it won't irritate my skin but it would still irritate it red you name it! Have not even shaved other places yet and it's still sharp even after shaving my hairy face!,5,0,B0787GLBMV
"I saw these on the internet as a way to get rid of unwanted peach fuzz, everyone was raving about how soft their skin felt but forgot to mention how prickly your face feels as the peach fuzz grows back. It’s really no different than if you were to use a leg razor on your face in my opinion.",2,0,B0787GLBMV
"I was really hoping this product was going to be great but it wasn’t after the first use I was left with a few cuts on my face. This is not my first time using a product like this so not sure what makes it cut because I was doing everything correctly.
Will not be purchasing again",5,0,B0787GLBMV
These razor get all the hair off my face. They are not so sharp that they will damage your skin. I use the razors about twice a week. The cover for the razor keeps the razor protected. It is nice to know that I will not cut my hand when I reach in the draw for other items. This is a good purchase.,5,0,B0787GLBMV
These are soooo good but be careful because they are sharp and will cut anything you pass it through. I have been using these for facial hairs since I am unable to get my face threaded. But I don’t even dare to get it near my eyebrows. I accidentally cut a bit of my sideburns but it’s not noticeable. Also I gave my friend one while we were doing our makeup and her hand barely slipped and it cut the end of her eyebrow off! Lol so be careful when using. BUT VERY GOOD! You really only need one pass over with these.,5,0,B0787GLBMV
I never realized what a difference a product like this could make for my skin! It will make your face so stickin smooth. I do have pretty sensitive skin so sometimes it does get a little red but it resolves quickly after! I do this about once a week and it has changed the texture of my skin for the better! It’s super easy to use and love the price point!,5,0,B0787GLBMV
This is the best face razor I have ever used. It took my hair off so easily. Extremely good quality. I am a licensed cosmetologist and do makeup on clients and I feel like it makes my skin look flawless after I put my foundation on. I love these and will continue to purchase. Price is also good for the quality of the product.,5,0,B0787GLBMV
I've been using Tinkle for a few years and still think they're great but these do have a slight advantage.

I'm able to get 2 uses out of them when cleaned thoroughly between.,5,0,B0787GLBMV
"I've never had micro derm on my face. The peach fuzz and chin hairs on my face were really starting to bother me.
This little tool really works. It's scary to use at first, then you realize its easy once you get the angle.
My husband said it made my skin look younger and fresher. I agree.",5,One,B0787GLBMV
"My skin did not like the tugging pressure when the mini razor was applied to my face. It felt like I was ripping hair, not comfortable! I have used it around my eyebrows with no issue. Not the best for sensitive skin",4,One,B0787GLBMV
I bought these specifically for the eyebrow shaper and how the cover would only expose 1/2 of the blade. Did not work at all. This razor cut and scraped my face so badly. I have been using the Tinkle for several years and only had a few scrapes because of beginner errors. I do not recommend and going back to Tinkle.,1,2,B0787GLBMV
"I love the way that these make my skin feel, so soft and smooth, my boyfriend loves touching my face even more now! you can totally see and feel the difference immediately after, and between sections of your face that you have shaved and haven't. genuinely feel like these help my other skin care products, including prescription, sink in better. absolutely recommend, just make sure you use a light hand if you have sensitive skin, they wont cut you due to the awesome microguards that they talk about on the packaging, but they will irritate sensitive skin if you are too rough.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"My dermatologist told me that I really didn’t need to spend money on dermaplaning to get rid of my fuzz or to exfoliate. She recommended these and saved me hundreds of dollars. I watched and online video but really you cannot mess up. Just have dry skin, pull it right, go slow. Don’t press too hard. Then moisturize with sensitive cream after. Works well and keeps for about 3 weeks.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"I have a very fuzzy face and this product easily removed all the fuzz. Definitely use some oil or something after doing this to your face and moisturize after. I stupidly just steamed my face before and shaved with no oil. Not a good look. My hair hasn't grown back yet (3 weeks), but I imagine based off of what I have seen from shaving my mustache for about a year now, it's not gonna grow back darker or thicker.

"I got these to get rid of pesky peach fuzz on my face. It definitely does the job, but isn't the nicest to use. At times it feels really rough on my face and can leave a strange feeling after. It wasn't as smooth of a shave as I expected and felt almost as if it was tearing at my face. It did the job and I'll continue to use them. I might even buy them again depending on how it goes after using all three. Nice product, just not the best.",4,0,B0787GLBMV
Unusable. First it doesn't pick up any hair at all and then it slashes you. Stay away!,1,5,B0787GLBMV
"Wow! There’s noting like using these thing and the. putting on your oil/moisturizer on fresh super smooth skin! Better than ALL the other competitors and a great price! And NO...it doesn’t make the hair grow back darker and thicker in its place...just buy and try, you’ll be hooked!",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"I have purchased this product multiple times to exfoliate and get rid of “peach fuzz” on my face. I have very sensitive skin and these work great until the razor starts to become a little duller. I notice red lines and marks when this happens. Overall, I love this product.",5,One,B0787GLBMV
"Took me a little while to figure out the right angle to use this effectively but once I did it worked like a charm. I’ve used it for shaping eyebrows and managing the little bit of blonde peach fuzz I have on my upper lip. I haven’t tried it anywhere else but no bad reactions or pain, and relatively easy to maneuver with a bit of practice.",5,2,B0787GLBMV
I've tried so many products for removing peach fuzz and dermaplaning. Hands down this one is the best. Easy to use and does an outstanding job removing peach fuzz as well as dead skin cells. I have sensitive skin and did not have any irritation as I've had with other products. Will but this again.,5,0,B0787GLBMV
"So let's face it, busy gals don't always have time to sit and pluck your unwanted little eyebrow hairs, or whatever other hairs you declare war on. I, have PCOS so those little unwanted hairs pop up quickly. Schick Silk Touch-Up Multipurpose Exfoliating Dermaplaning Tool has been my best friend when in a time crunch. It is great for percussion, great blades and does the job exactly as described. It is my go to!",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"I got these in the mail today. Couldn’t wait to try it out. I looked up a lot of different tools before getting these, and I have no regrets. It was so fun and satisfying to use. I was afraid I’d cut myself, but these things are high key idiot proof. If you’re worried, watch some YouTube videos and then practice on your leg or arm hair first (I did, just to see how it went). If you’re cutting yourself, go watch some videos and try again because it’s probably just the angle/user error. 10/10 recommend. My face feels so soft.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"I have super sensitive skin, and these worked really well. The blades were really sharp to get all the small hairs, but not so sharp I was scared of getting cut. They were much better quality than the previous brand I had been using.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
I bought these because I was tired of waiting to make an appointment to get waxes since the pandemic has severely limited availability. This was very easy to use and worked great! It was nice to get 3 so I can just replace them as needed. Definitely sharp so be careful!,5,0,B0787GLBMV
"My sking type is Sensitive and dry . . I am in love love love with this . Been living with peach fuzz all my life and living under the impression that shaving will increase the hairgrowth , It is GOD SEnD .
I have been tidying up my brows as well with this . It is a great beauty tool :)",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"First time using these, wish I had known about them sooner. I've done plucking and nair-ing on my upper lip and both methods leave me sore with breakouts. This little blade just wiped that fuzz right off with no side effects. I'm a little worried about the regrowth being thick or dark but if it's a problem I'll update this review. So far so good",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"I recently had a facial at a 5-star hotel spa and the woman shaved my face - now I’m obsessed !
Ordered these and they’re awesome !
Your face feels so smooth and your skin feels great afterwards. You gotta try it and NO - nothing will grow back darker I promise !!",5,0,B0787GLBMV

HIGHLY RECOMMEND!",,0,B0787GLBMV
These razors work wonders!!!! I have dark facial hair that grows back rather quickly and I’ve never found anything that removes it as well as these do. It was so easy to do and I definitely recommend using on dry skin (safer and more exfoliating). I loved my first pack so much I went ahead and bought a second to stock up!,5,0,B0787GLBMV
"Bought these after Olay discontinued my hair removal cream for my face. Love this even more! It’s the new fad it seems and rightfully so! Use in on my peach fuzz on my cheeks and my upper lip. Helps my makeup apply so much better. And so easy! I use face cream not dry when using, seems to work better for my sensitive skin.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
These work great in a pinch to remove the peach fuzz from your face. They are easy to use and do a great job. Unfortunately they don’t last long and the blade typically falls off before it gets too dull to use. Luckily they are cheap and not meant to last forever.,4,0,B0787GLBMV
"I started getting fine blonde peach fuzz on my face and chin that grew after taking skin, hair and nail vitamins. I paid $60.00 twice for a professional derma planning and saw this product which looked identical to what they used. Figured I’d give it a try. It’s easy to use, works great and I’m saving a lot of money now. Plus I can use it regularly to keep the peach fuzz gone. So much nicer putting in makeup now!",5,0,B0787GLBMV
These are the best option I have found for my sensitive skin. Using Nair and waxing my upper lip has left me with rash-stach too many times. These are a quick and easy way to get rid of the unwanted hair. You do have to be very very careful not to go over the same spot too many times or pull the blade sideways. I do sometimes still get a few irritation bumps after use. Sometimes pulls hair.,4,0,B0787GLBMV
"These little gadgets worked PERFECTLY for shaping my eyebrows, removing my unibrow, reducing the thickness of my sideburns, shaving off my mustache, and getting rid of those pesky chin hairs. Yeah, I'm a hairy lady, and I'd totally recommend this to anyone!",5,0,B0787GLBMV

"I have very sensitive skin, and the results from using these were phenomenal! My skin felt so smooth and soft especially the next day. I will say one thing , I recommend doing this(dermaplaning) at night before bed , it makes the skin a bit red at first but that’s totally normal, no products on your face after ! I just sprayed my rose water after to hydrate. The next day I was so impressed, my skin hasn’t looked this good in a while! Makes makeup go on so effortlessly and don’t even get me started on the powder ! I will definitely be buying when I run out ! Such an amazing deal.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
I love the little razors! I have been using them since the pandemic/quaratine started and can no longer go to get my brows done. Im so glad I bought these! I love that the plastic cap exposes just a tiny area of the blade to help out when I'm doing my brows.. I was worried about shaving too much off or even part of my lashes Haha but not with the help of the cap!,5,0,B0787GLBMV
"Wished I can return this. No use at all. I wanted to
Love this item because of all the good reviews but I hurt myself when I tried to use this to trim my eye brows.",1,2,B0787GLBMV
"I love these razors! The great thing about them is that they come with a guard specifically for eyebrows that enables you to shape them better. For exfoliating my face: after cleansing, while my skin is still damp I gently massage jojoba oil all over and use the razor to remove dead skin cells. My skin feels like a baby's afterwards.
I highly recommend these!",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"Great and inexpensive way to groom. These are very cheap for how great of quality they are. My girlfriend was so excited to get them, with ease and without any accidents yet, she is able to groom all of the tiny spots she needs to. I would recommend this to give to the women AND men in your life.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"I used this for dermaplaning my face for the first time and it worked great. I can't compare this to any other similar razors since I haven't tried any others. Overall, these razors are perfect for dermaplaning your face as a beginner (make sure you do your research on how to do it).",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"Does exactly what the package says. I use it for Eyebrows and upper lip. No irritation, and also works okay for bikini line if razors are too rugged for you.

I’m pretty happy with the product and have no complaints. I would buy it again",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"Love this product, however came super damaged. Box had a slight tear in the back by the barcode & the razors were on the verge of breaking because the plastic handles were bent (assuming in transit) not happy. Don’t want to use them because I fear that the handle will break at the plastic bend and that I’ll cut myself.
The product itself is amazing though!",4,0,B0787GLBMV
Very easy to use I saw some people on here say it cut them and left scratches on their face well the thing is with these you don’t need to press hard it takes the hair right off by just gently brushing it over ur skin I cut myself two times but they are just micro cuts it was my fault I pressed a little too hard but I would definitely buy these again my face is soooo smooth love em!,5,0,B0787GLBMV
"Was not a fan at all! This feels SO scratchy when you rip it across your skin. I say rip, because this does not glide in any way, shape, or form. It feels like it would be used to remove the pills off an old sweater, not peach fuzz off your face. I tried all three in the pack, thinking maybe it was a fluke. Nope. I would NEVER recommend these.",1,0,B0787GLBMV
"Unfortunately, I have excessive hair growth on my chin and laser hair removal would be a crapshoot due to lighter hair color. I decided to buy this pack to see if these would help cut down on my ""whiskers."" And after one use, I'm hooked. My skin feels so good and it feels like my moisturizer is setting in better. I even got my eyebrows groomed in no time at all. I will most definitely be buying again once these have served their purpose.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"I've had professional dermaplanning done. This is not the same. If you are looking for a cheaper alternative then this will do in a pinch. I have sensitive skin and it made it more irritated. The directions on the package don't give you any clear use for the product.
You will definitely need to watch the video to learn proper use.",3,0,B0787GLBMV
"Its like shaving. I don't know why I expected something more when it's essentially a razor. I will say it gets a close shave, BUT it IS a shave. Don't use this on places you wouldn't normally shave! Buzzfeed advertised it with someone who shaved all their peach-fuzz off. WHY??? You're going to have to continue to shave that place (their face) now! The hair will grow back (obviously). The razor is delicate enough to be used on delicate places, so if you already shave those places, go for it.",4,0,B0787GLBMV
"I pluck my eyebrows, but it's annoying to try to get all the small, tiny hairs around it, but because my hair is black, it's a noticeable fuzz around them. I've tried to use shaving razors, but the handles are in the way and I'm always worried I'll shave part of my brow right off. These are a little awkward to use at some angles, but much easier than a razor, and they are sharp enough to easily get all the tiny hairs.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"These razors are amazing for facial hair! As a woman with fine hair, Ive always shaved my face despite the misconeption that it will grow back thicker and darker. These tools are perfect to get that straight edge line eyebrow after ive plucked them. Its also perfect for upper lip , chin, and cheeks/side burns. They dont work well on thicker hair for example armpits (?) but facial hair is a for sure. They are super cheap and last a long time. I've had them for 6 months and some are still going strong. It saves me a lot of money on waxing. Howeverrr, they can irritate the skin and leave it red and rashy so I always make sure to wash and prep my face beforehand and moisturize well afterwards. The uncomfortably only lasts a few minutes in that case!",4,0,B0787GLBMV
Very effective and easy to use product. I was able to scrape so much peach fuzz and dead skin off of my face. My face feels amazing. My face has the clean feeling that you get with your teeth after you visit the dentist. I will definitely add this to my daily skin regiment.,5,0,B0787GLBMV

I saw an advertisement on this I thought I'd try it I am so happy that I did I love it I've used it twice maybe 3 times now and still only using the first one and I love it it definitely leaves you smooth and it's easy to use it's light and easy to pack if you need to,5,0,B0787GLBMV

"I bought this to replace a sonic dermaplaning tool, and I like these so much better! These are sharper but easy to control. I use this all over my face for exfoliation and light hair removal.

"I had seen this little device advertised somewhere in a beauty site online. I was very hesitant about ordering it, as I did not want to have my fine dark peach fuzz return stiff and dark. I, however, did us it and my face seems to glow and feels fantastic. I will leave another review when I see how the hair returns.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"I got this because of all the good reviews and a stupid Buzzfeed article. This is a surprisingly great product for the price. Takes care of my lady 'tash and takes off some dead in the process.

"Where have you been my whole eyebrow care life? Who needs the trouble of waxing when this tool exists!! My eyebrows were perfectly done in less than 5 mins, no redness or itch afterwards.

These are incredible little tools. I wish o had known about these earlier in life! Who knew! I also used them to touch up my daughters eyebrows. I use them on myself to do dermaplnning! My skin feels so soft and silky. I use a vitamin c serum afterwards and my Omani night cream and boy does it soak it all up! Fuzz free nourished face now! Try it!,5,One,B0787GLBMV
"Why not use a regular twin blade disposable razor? I bought this product thinking I would have more control trimming under my eyebrows.

"Gave me a bit of a razor burn, but my eyebrows have never looked this clean and neat!

Quick, painless, effective and the size means I can pack one in my toiletry bag easily when I travel (you never know when a stray hair may show up!) and keep in my bathroom drawer at home. Love it and would/have recommend to anyone that needs a little clean up of their facial hair.",5,0,B0787GLBMV

"I bought these because I have really fine peach fuzz all over my face. Dermablading in my area is $200 or more. So, I thought about doing it myself. I'm really glad I did! Super easy to use. The blade is small and easy to use. So much hair came off, and my skin felt so smooth after. I highly recommend if you're looking to get rid of your peach fuzz! My hair started to grow back after a month and a half.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
I haven’t cut myself at all while using this. There’s a way you have to use this -It is a razor. Right now I’m dealing with a few acne and bumps on my skin prior to this so I’m careful around those areas of course. This really takes off my peach fuzz and dead skin etc which you can’t see!,5,0,B0787GLBMV
"I have been wanting to try razors like this for a while, and finally decided to go for it. I almost got the Twinkle brand seeing as I've heard to much about them, but opted for these instead. And boy am I glad I did! These work very well and are super easy to use. I don't usually do much with my brows (I've had bad experiences with waxing and plucking so I tend to stay away from it), but with these I can have nicely shaped brows within a few minutes! Totally worth it; I'm glad I decided to try these.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
I have sensitive skin and it’s really easy to handle and doesn’t hurt or burn or anything it’s makes your skin very smooth and bright from my experience. But WARNING you can definitely cut your skin and bleed from holding it wrong or being too rash with it....yes I’m talking from experience 💀 I accidentally held it wrong and was being rash and impatient a little cause I was in a hurry to get ready and now I got a tiny cut on my cheek and it did bleed quite a lot not even just a little drop. So definitely be careful with it so you don’t cut yourself but otherwise a very good product I liked it 😁,5,0,B0787GLBMV
"For the price and size, this is a pretty efficient tool. Not only can you see the peach fuzz being shaved off, but dead skin cells come off as well which really leaves you with smoother skin. Just crossing my fingers the blades don't get dull after only a few uses.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"Was excited to get rid of peach fuzz & dermaplaning. But they were so dull they were useless. Maybe got a dud but got money back. Good luck other purchasers. Update..Seller refunded my money & didn't have to return the blades. Gave them an additional star for excellent customer service 👍. After reading the good reviews maybe I just got a bad set, too bad.",2,0,B0787GLBMV
"Wow!! Just wowwwww!!! After using this product my skin is so soft and clean looking. I did not shave my entire face but I did on my brows and upper lips!! I’ve never been able to do my brows myself and have always just paid to get them threaded. After using them I don’t think I’ll ever go back lol. The shave was very close to the skin and didn’t hurt in the slightest!! My hands were a little awkward at first but that’s just because I’ve never used anything like this before. The photos I attached are a before and after on my brows!!!

For application I cleansed my entire face, shaved, then applied a toner and moisturizer",5,0,B0787GLBMV
Works great and you can get done in minutes. I usually use them 3 times each before throwing away. Your skincare and makeup will go on so smoothly!!!,5,One,B0787GLBMV
"I love it because it actually gets rid of my hair. It does come back and they seem thick because the ends of the hair are blunt, but out of wax strips, electric razors, and other things I've tried, this one leaves an actual smooth skin. I use it when my skin is dry when I wake up and then use my face wash and moisturize. I have to use it at least every other day but it's because my hair grows quickly. Still worth it and pretty quick to do.",5,0,B0787GLBMV

It came with three in the pack and also a cover to use when shaping eyebrows. I used the date after I got it, and it was easy to hold and maneuver. My face never felt so smooth!",5,0,B0787GLBMV
It was very easy to use on the little fuzzy hairs on my cheeks from my ears around and under my lower lip and chin area. It was slightly harder to do above my upper lip but doable. I heard about it from a famous person on the Rachel Ray show who shared that she has been using this method for over 10 years and doing it at home and not paying for the procedure. No need to pay for this service. In my opinion it causes less damage and is easier than trying to use tweezers and does not create more lip lines.,4,0,B0787GLBMV
Extremely sharp but effective. Take the hair off any part of your body easily. Must be careful because these little guys are way stronger than they appear. They also take a small layer of skin off so important to moisturize afterwards. But worth it. I’ve repurchased these already and will again.,5,0,B0787GLBMV

"I used these to tackle some unsightly lip hair and it worked perfectly! It's addictive to watch your skin exfoliate off. I didn't want to stop. I did, however, suffer a small scratch on my neck while using on my chin, but it's akin to a light cat scratch. My skin feels amazing. I tried to use on my eyebrows, but I couldn't really figure it out. Great everywhere else, though!",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"This product is great for women's mustache area and also the peach fuzz. It removes the hair easily and leaves you with a smooth feeling immediately after using this. However, I do get a stubble feeling several hours after you've shaved the hair off which softens as the days go by after shaving. I also get some pimples after using this so I make sure I use toner right away to treat the skin. If you have any raised moles on your face, be careful, it will cut them very easily. I bought a fancy battery operated hair remover which is just a very loud and inefficient shaver. Save your money and buy these. Overall, very happy with this product for the price.",4,0,B0787GLBMV
"I bought this on a whim because the product photos looked oh so satisfying of the dead skin piled up in little dust bunnies on the face, but had little hope it would actually do anything for me.
But here I lay, 5 minutes after using this product, with cheeks as soft as they were at birth. Seriously. Never felt my skin this pure before. I feel played a fool for never thinking to exfoliate my skin like this. Buy it.",5,One,B0787GLBMV
"Girl, if you have not dermaplaned your face, YOU ARE MISSING OUT! This gets all the peach fuzz off (no, peach fuzz WILL NOT grow back dark and thick), and removes the top layer of dead skin. I do this weekly. After you dermaplane, your makeup will glide on so smooth, and your skin will look and feel flawless. You have to try it! Even my boyfriend uses these because he loves them so much. Spas provide this service for $70+ but this is a less expensive, quality product. I haven't had any issues--just make sure you don't go over the same area several times, otherwise you'll irritate your skin. I'll definitely continue to repurchase :)",5,0,B0787GLBMV
I wasn't expecting much from these but they're actually quite amazing! They shave very well! I use it to clean up my brows and peach fuzz which allows my moisturizers and cleansers a deeper penetration. So basically my skin is super smooth and blemish free because I maintain my face with these bad boys,5,0,B0787GLBMV
Where have these been all my life?! Great product for getting rid of peach fuzz that I can always see on my face. Just remember you must use it in a downward motion with the direction of the hair (not against). Hair is slow to grow back and is the same thickness (no stubble or anything like that). The photo is silly as the person still has the cover on the blade.,5,0,B0787GLBMV
"I loved using these for all over face hair and dead skin removal. Would definitely recommend!

I have already ordered more.",5,0,B0787GLBMV

"Didn't work for me, maybe I was using it wrong... Didn't remove any dead skin and barely got rid of peach fuzz. I tried going with the grain, against the grain and every other way with very little return for my efforts. My skin started to get irritated because I had to run the blade over the same place so many times to get an area completely clear. Also, it says on the package to discard if you drop one, and I'm a very clumsy person so it's just not for me",1,0,B0787GLBMV

I’ve always been nervous to use these because my mom always told me if I removed the hair from my face it would grow in dark & thick like a mans. That hasn’t happened yet😉 these work great & haven’t cut me. Good for exfoliating the skin also. I couldn’t believe how much blonde baby hair I had on my face until I removed. My face feels extra beautiful since using these. Must have if you’re a woman.,5,0,B0787GLBMV

One of the questions on the review is if the item is moisturizing... no it’s a plain razor. That aside the product works great and was really easy to use. I like how I can quickly do my eyebrows and not have to pluck them and risk hair not growing back in the future. I in fact shaved my whole face 2x now and it works great!,5,0,B0787GLBMV
"Wow are these sharp! They definitely remove hair and dry flaky skin. They work much better than others I’ve tried. Excellent value, highly recommend",5,One,B0787GLBMV
"I have bought these before and loved them. But this time when I bought them they have flaws in the blades that keep cutting my skin. The first one I used in the pack cut my face several times to where I was bleeding. I looked closely at it and could see the tip had a slight curve that was really sharp. I just tossed it and figured that can happen to one occasionally, I guess. But this morning I got a new one out and same issue. I just tossed the rest out. Not sure why they were like that. Like I said, I have used these same ones before with no issues. I think I will try a different brand next time though.",1,0,B0787GLBMV
"These are horrible! No matter what angle I used or how careful & gentle I was, I have cuts ALL over & bled very easily. Will be returning! I’m better off using a regular razor. It’s safer.",1,0,B0787GLBMV
This product has been life changing. It removes hair easily and painlessly. I've used it all over and had great results. I've even used it on my eyebrows and they've turned out great. I have cut myself a few times with it so be careful. Would highly recommend to anyone who is tired of shaving and plucking their face,5,0,B0787GLBMV
"Easy to use. If it’s your first time using be cautious, blades are sharp. I use to remove peach fuzz facial hair. Face looks so much smother and cleaner. I have bought multiple times already. I love this product",5,0,B0787GLBMV
At first i really liked these blades but i later noticed compared to others the blades was rough and kinda hurt me a bit I don't have sensitive skin but i wouldn’t recommend it for u if u do. For us normal skin people u can get it but i think there are better options.,3,0,B0787GLBMV
"After all the good reviews I had high hopes, but was disappointed in the results. I don't think it shaved anything. After much frustration, I thought why not just try my regular razor. And that worked really well. This was just a waste of money for me.",1,0,B0787GLBMV
"Although this did remove my mustache, it did NOT make me look like Beyoncé. So it’s possible I set the bar too high, but regardless... I’m a bit disappointed.",5,One,B0787GLBMV
"If you are looking at this product because you have acne scars, or hormonal acne and want a clear face DO NOT DO IT! I used this once and it cause every peach fuzz to grow back like an ingrown hair. Worst breakout of my life, and it’s been months and it’s still healing.",1,0,B0787GLBMV
"I use these to remove my peach fuzz on my face and shape my eyebrows easily. I did not expect them to work as well as they did. My face feels super smooth and soft, and skincare products are more effective now. I was scared to shape my eyebrows with it, but it came with a small attachment that makes the blade smaller so you don't accidentally shave off half your eyebrow lol! I love them, 10/10",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"USED IT FOR: dermaplanning my face

Was super easy to use. I definitely recommend watching a YouTube video or two to get the right... I know most people say it’s great to work with but I recommend pairing it with a hyaluronic acid afterwards. I didn’t necessarily cut myself but I bleed in two tiny spots so I just say practice caution!",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"I love this product. It gets rid of all of the unwanted peach fuzz on my face and I can also clean up my eyebrows with it. It’s easy to use/hold. My skin is super sensitive though and whenever I use this my skin gets extremely red, and has little razor burn marks on it even though I try to use it with a light hand. It doesn’t stop me from using it though....",4,0,B0787GLBMV
They really work and getting 3 in the order is a plus. Amazing how much fuzz you actually have on your face. My skin is sensitive and this tool has not irritated it at all. I recommend these.,5,0,B0787GLBMV
"GAME CHANGER! I never knew I had so much peach fuzz on my face. I would warn not to use any exfoliants directly after using this product as I made that mistake once and it almost burned my entire face off and melted it onto the floor. Despite that minor mishap, I will buy this product 100 times over. It makes my skin look brighter! :)",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"This product is amazing, I never knew i needed this in my life until i tried it. I was very skeptical at first about basically ""shaving"" my face but im now in love. I wasn't super hairy but definitely had a bit of peach fuzz on my checks and longer than desired peach fuzz on my neck. Hair has not grown back thicker or darker like i was afraid. It makes my skin very smooth and my makeup go on beautifully. Its amazing what a difference it has made. I do notice a difference in my pores as well from scraping away the dead skin. I've been using mine now for 2 weeks and the blade still seems sharp. DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THESE and you can't beat the price!",5,0,B0787GLBMV
Blading has definitely helped my skin glow by removing the dead skin regularly. It also has gotten rid of the little peach fuzz on the sides of my face nicely. I gave it 4 stars though bc I have had several break just by regular use.,4,0,B0787GLBMV
"The blades did exactly what they needed to do- great for shaping eyebrows etc, and can exfoliate as well. If your skin gets easily irritated though, I wouldn’t recommend microdermabrasion, but in general, it does exactly what it’s supposed to!",5,0,B0787GLBMV
Reason for 2 stars is...... I’ll just stick to waxing . Hair grows back darker on face and faster too! I purchased this because I got tired of waxing my face - and what a mistake . I would use this in the future only to clean up my eyebrows but that’s it!,2,0,B0787GLBMV
"Just purchased these and used them for the first time. I have naturally light hair, but wanted to take care of the upper lip, find a better way than plucking for my brows, and do something about the knuckle hair too. This is so easy and quick to use. Also feels kind of satisfying, as well, not sure why???
Only downside is that you'll want to moisturize afterwards, especially if you dont use any shaving cream or gel. I didnt because I didnt want to get it built up on the blade. These are fantastic for the price. Will be buying again.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"Easy to use and hold, but there were a few in the pack that had either pieces of plastic or metal sticking up that ended up scratching my face up like crazy. Not very happy with the package I received. That being said, I believe that was a defect.",3,0,B0787GLBMV
"I use these on my husbands and my face. I have very sensitive skin and these don't mess with my skin at all. I watched a youtube video to learn how to properly use them. I use them on my entire face and no, it does not make the hair grow back quicker or thicker at all. I probably use only once every 2 weeks and that's only because I love that it gets all the dead skin off. It has really helped my skin.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"I have never used these before but they were very easy to get the hang of, will definitely be using these.
4 stars are for the excessive use of packaging, they could be easily be packaged with a lot less plastic, I know that there are made of plastic but every bit counts.",4,0,B0787GLBMV
"Applied very modest pressure, didn't bear down on it at all. The handle just broke off right beside the blade head. Very weak design. Maybe just one bad one? I'll try another and if it repeats, will try to get refund and buy a better model",2,0,B0787GLBMV
"Have they changed the blades since all the positive reviews were written?? This razor doesn’t cut the hair! Upon closer inspection it’s a kind of serated edge that is barely sharp. I went over the hair multiple times and it doesn’t shave it off—at all. I’m back to a cheap disposable razor which gives a nice derma plane result all over but I was really hoping this new razor word give a clean trim to the brow area. Yeah, not so much.",2,0,B0787GLBMV
I don’t like better than the ones I normally use. It’s nice to have the option to shorten the blade for narrow/creased/ or hard to reach places like under the eyebrows. I just wish it was a lower price since you really shouldn’t be using them over and over again for sanitary purposes,4,0,B0787GLBMV
"Not impressed. The blade is so dull that it barely removed any hair. Not buying again, and wouldn’t recommend. I would recommend the Remington electric facial trimmer that’s made for trimming eyebrows. It works great on female facial hair and peach fuzz.",2,0,B0787GLBMV
"Like any human I get a little peach fuzz on my face. It’s normal and perfectly natural. But for personal interest I got this to help remove the peach fuzziness and the dead skin that accumulates on ones face because I have more of an oily skin type. These worked great for that. Real Easton use and easy to clean, no nicks or razor burns if that’s a concern for anyone. I also have very sensitive skin and these worked well",4,0,B0787GLBMV
"I love love love these . Their so small and precise I use them for practically anything I can think of . Peach fuzz,upper lip,jawline,brows, hell I even use these on my feet and toes 😂 Even though I’m blonde and my hair is very light ,I still like to be hairless everywhere possible . I also have dry combination skin that is sensitive in some areas and this did not have any negative downsides in regards to that .",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"This is easy to use, but be careful or you can cut yourself. I like it for trimming and shaping my eyebrows, but I made the mistake of seeing how my skin felt if I used it all over. It removed my 'peach fuzz"" with ease, but I cannot imagine someone using this to exfoliate. This left my skin bumpy and red. If anything, it aggravated my skin.",3,0,B0787GLBMV
I’ve used several products like this including expensive ones. This product far surpasses all the others. I would not have expected such an inexpensive product to work so well. All of the peach fuzz is gone. My skin feels so soft. I highly recommend.,5,0,B0787GLBMV
"I can’t believe that I found something I like better than Tinkle razors, but this is honestly better—the blade is easier on my skin, the handle is more ergonomic and of a softer, more comfortable plastic, and I think it might even stay sharper, longer. I‘be been through a pack of 3 now—I use them daily for microdermabrasion on my face, and the pack has lasted about 6 weeks. Great value!",4,0,B0787GLBMV
"Good quality for the price and works fine. However, after a couple weeks of sporadic use, I started noticing the fine little hairs on my upper lip were growing in darker and courser than previously, so I switched back to at-home waxing strips. For the price point, though, these are worth seeing if they work for you.",3,0,B0787GLBMV
"These are helpful if you have a lot of blonde hairs around eyebrows, mustache etc. But they feel like you’re just shaving with a dry razor and can’t get many uses out of them they get clogged and dull fast.

These work and will removed the peach fuzz from your face however you have to hold the razor a certain way in order to not get scratched by the end of the blades. That is my only complaint. I didn't have any expectation other than I wanted to try them.,4,0,B0787GLBMV
"Love love love these. I bought to get rid of face peach fuzz and to also scrape the dead skin off. So much gross stuff came off of my face. After, I was glowing. I recommend moisturizing after. They are very easy to use and I can go about three weeks in between uses.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"I got them mainly for the exfoliating but was shocked at how much hair came off too. Hair I didn't know we as there. Lol You have to be careful not to press into the skin, they are really sharp. I don't recommend if you have acne or any kind of irritations on your skin for that reason but my skin felt so much softer, smoother after first use.",5,0,B0787GLBMV

Basically I will get rid of my unibrow (waxing and plucking both irritate) and upper lip, as well as all the spots blind me missed in the shower. I’ve tried exfoliating with it a little and that irritated my skin but not so much that moisturizer afterwards didn’t make it go away.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"These razors are really sharp and cleanly shave face even pick the tiniest hair on face!, the precision cover is very handy for brows. but the issue is the extra sharp edge on the top of the razor that caused bad cuts while I was using them, it seems like the sharp edge is as a result of bad molding or something. I put a small glue type on sharp edge to prevent cut. Note that the angle of hand is very important to prevent cut,hold the razor at 30 degree angle.",3,0,B0787GLBMV
Not that sharp.Plastic edges scratched my face.,3,One,B0787GLBMV

PLEASE be cautious though, it's no joke when it says these things are razors, I was cleaning a new one and accidentally sliced my finger open.",5,0,B0787GLBMV

"I love this! Wish I had known about this sooner. You can just gently glide over your face and it picks up all of your peach fuzz. I also use it on my arms and my arms are so much smoother than waxing. Waxing causes bumps for me. Unlike a razor, you dont need water or shaving cream. Also I have been able to use the same razor 3x now and it has not become dull.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
Very well made and surprisingly really sharp so take caution. I mainly use these to clean up my brows and lip area. I'm a little too afraid of shaving my entire face but I think these will do well for that too. Highly recommend these.,5,0,B0787GLBMV
These work really well...better than expected. I have really thick dark hair and it was so easy and efficient. Highly recommend. Get a few as after a few uses it can go dull.,5,0,B0787GLBMV

"So I’m a big impulse buyer and seen these on a bloggers page and was like opp gotta have it. I shaved my face IMMEDIATELY when I got it. I can say it works good. I got a little irritating on my chin but that’s a sensitive area no matter what so I was expecting it. All in all a good product. And for those of you scared, just remember to watch some videos before you try. It’s super easy and my makeup looks beautiful with out that mustache 🙈",5,0,B0787GLBMV
Works effortlessly and does not hurt or irritate my skin. Easy to use. Takes unwanted hairs away with ease. Great product. Don't get discouraged of the blade size for small jobs (you can angle it to where you only have to use a small part of the blade). Bigger the blade=less work you have to do for the bigger spots. I've only ever used the cheap smaller ones you would find in any store. These were a great price for how good they work!,5,0,B0787GLBMV

No more fuzz all over my face!",5,0,B0787GLBMV

Don’t believe all the good reviews. Fakespot gives this razor an “F” and they are correct. Wish I had checked with them before I ordered this. Trims no hair off your face but scratches your face up. I wouldn’t put this thing anywhere near my eyebrows. The blade is jagged and rips your skin off.,1,0,B0787GLBMV

It is amazing what these little guys get off of your face! My skin is so smooth where I used it. I did nick myself but it was completely user error. I had mild sensitivity afterwards but nothing that I wouldn't expect from good exfoliation. I would definitely recommend a try for the price.,5,0,B0787GLBMV

"I usually use facial razors from Sephora, but I decided to give these a try. I'm pretty disappointed tbh. These somehow were less effective and more damaging to my skin.

Sadly I already opened the package so I cannot return.",2,0,B0787GLBMV
"These work pretty well for removing hair, however they are sharper than a lot of other facial razors, so please be mindful of that. The plastic securing the blade in place is easy to remove to clean, but not easy enough to remove whilst in use.

As long as you take care of them, I imagine they could last quite a bit.",5,0,B0787GLBMV

These are great and I’ve been using them and reordering for a few months however I’m noticing the price increase each time I reorder. It’s up $2 from when I initially started purchasing. If the price is going to keep increasing I’ll have to find a new brand these don’t last long enough to be worth it. The blades dull after a few weeks.,3,0,B0787GLBMV
I love these. These work great especially for the price point. At ulta I would spend 10 dollars just for one of them. I feel like these actually work better then the ones I have purchased from ulta or any drug store. They work extremely well and don’t leave any kind of razor burn.,5,0,B0787GLBMV
I have acne prone and sensitive skin and this made me break out like crazy! It's a mix of a breakout and rash.

Love these to pieces!! I have very fine peach fuzz and this does an amazing job of getting it off fast. My foundation never looked so smooth!

"These work great initially, but they wear out really quickly and have a hard time removing hair from curved places like the chin. The eyebrow attachment works, but because you’re only removing the hair from the surface you’d have to redo it like every 2 days to make it last. I used them all but I don’t think I’ll repurchase.",3,0,B0787GLBMV
"The ridges in the blade often nicks my sensitive skin. I thought this would be easier or less scary than using a #10 Scalpel for dermaplaning BUT I actually prefer the scalpel.

I’ve used blades like this to shave my face before but the edge/corner of this one was such a sharp corner it repeatedly cut my face even with light pressure.,2,0,B0787GLBMV
Have cut myself twice around my nostril area from using this. Seems to dull my skin after using it. Think just using a razor does a better job due to skin issues.,1,0,B0787GLBMV
These work great! I had also bought an off brand that were dull and didn't work at all. So I was glad I bought these and had them to use when the others didn't work. From now on I'm buying only Schicks!,5,0,B0787GLBMV
These things are cool. Took me a minute to figure out which direction to use them. They work though. Not sure how great they are for exfoliating but they definitely get rid of the peach fuzz.,4,2,B0787GLBMV
"This is exactly what I was looking for as I was shaving some peach fuzz for the first time and everything went well. It was able to remove the tiniest of hairs successfully and exfoliated the skin along the way which I absolutely loved. Because of the exfoliating factor, the new skin that emerged from under the removed hair was glowing and looked clean. I'd highly recommend using some kind of oil as a shaving cream so the skin stays moisturized and after shaving to moisturize a lot so the area is not irritated. I couldn't figure out how to fit the cap to use the razor for eyebrows but I'm probably not going to use it for eyebrows until I'm really confident!",5,0,B0787GLBMV

"These are what I started dermaplaning with, but I'm switching to Tinkle due to the price. You can get twice as many Tinkles for the same price. Schick includes a blade minimizer to use on your eyebrow area, but I haven't really used it. As long as you're careful, it's not necessary.",4,0,B0787GLBMV

So I ordered the Stacked Skincare blade because Wayne Goss recommended it....these are SO much better. I honestly could never get a CLOSE shave with the ones from Stacked and I’m so annoyed I spent $80 on those! My skin has never been so smooth and I could tell these were better already with the first swipe. If you’re looking for something else GET THESE!!!!!!!!!,5,0,B0787GLBMV
I got these to dermaplane my face. It was my first time doing so. I did have some irritation and redness but it went away overnight. My only complaint with these is you can’t reuse them as they get dull too quickly but I guess that’s okay for the price.,3,0,B0787GLBMV
"I usually don’t write reviews but for this I feel like I have to. Do not purchase these. They left small little cuts all over my face and they burn so bad, I tried different angles but I still have small cuts all over. I’ve used other brands so I am familiar on how to work with them, yes they did remove peach fuzz but at the cost of cuts all over my face..",1,One,B0787GLBMV

"I really like these they work very good, they are sharp which is always good. The only thing I would say negative Is that the blade is long so sometimes it’s harder to use than the small ones. I have only ever used small did ones so it just might some getting used to overall very good",4,One,B0787GLBMV
"My only qualm is that they're slightly longer than I would like for the face, however, if you're looking for a product with a few alternative uses these a great. I spent the last 1-2 hours using one to shave the little balls of fuzz that builds up on sweaters, and it worked greatly. My favorite (and cheap) sweater is back to being soft to the touch. It took a while and I haven't bothered with the back, just the front and most of the sleeves but it worked incredibly to restore my crappy stained sweater to being soft again.",4,0,B0787GLBMV
The razors take a little bit of practice and it's hard to use around contoured areas such as your jawline and chin. My advice is to go slow and go downwards (don't go against the grain). The razors helped my skin feel so much more smoother. No peach fuzz and makeup is applied much easier. Highly recommend!,5,0,B0787GLBMV
These razors are the best I've used of the many brands Ive tried in the past. They are super sharp and really work well for dermaplaning your face at home. Used them the morning of my wedding and my makeup went on flawless and smooth!! These will be a new staple in my skincare box,5,0,B0787GLBMV
"I will always swear by these. I love these so much, maybe I am weird but they are kind of fun to use. They leave your skin so soft, they don't leave behind any little bumps or cause any pimples or anything like other things have for me since I have very sensitive skin. Just use a good moisturizer after! Love these and would recommend them to everyone!",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"Used them for the first time the other day. I never realized how much dead skin I had on my face, I mean I have extremely dry skin and moisturize daily and still had a ton! Also made my eyebrows look amazing! Be careful not to shave off your whole eyebrow and be gentle cause it is sharp.",5,0,B0787GLBMV

How did I live without these for so long? Ugh! My face feels so smooth. I had blonde peach fuzz near my ear and cheekbones. And I used them to tidy up my brows.

I have used many brands of the dermaplane tools. These are by far the worst. The end of the blade ended up catching on my skin (a smooth area) and scratching about 2 inches down my cheek.

"I don’t think this razor is good for sensitive skin. Since i was using this for the first time. I figured it was best to be gentle. I washed my face and patted it dry, and then used gentle small strokes. It did remove the peach fuzz. But my skin felt like it was on fire after using this! Putting my moisturizer on helped with the burning, but my face itches now and I have razor bumps above my lip and eyebrows.",2,0,B0787GLBMV

"After reading all the reviews and watching YouTube videos on this product, I decided to give it a try. I shaved my face the recommended way and unfortunately the hair in certain places did grow back thicker.

It is a handy tool and easy, I just wish I didn't use it because now I have to get the hair waxed multiple times to get it to grow back thinner and softer. Every woman's hair and body are different so I am not too surprised my hair grew back thicker than other women's.

Won't be purchasing again.",2,0,B0787GLBMV

It's important to use a serum and/or moisturizer right after.",5,0,B0787GLBMV

Not impressed with these..prefer the other brand people use on amazon. These did not leave a clean finish,2,One,B0787GLBMV

Don’t waste your money - I bought this to save money and I only ended up spending more. Because I ended up buying the more expensive product anyway. This didn’t do what it says it does. It will get rid of some facial hair but not all and not consistent. And it will leave your face so dry.,1,2,B0787GLBMV

Amazing! I have been using a different brand for about a year now to do my own Dermaplane. After having it done in office I thought I could try it.

If you want to slice up your face these are the razors for you! These are far too sharp for such a delicate area of skin.

Initial impression is it literally feels like an exposed razor blade. For the sensitive areas around the upper eye lid it doesn’t feel good. Border line dangerous like you could cut yourself. I can’t really find a good angle to get at my brows. It does remove hair though. Probably won’t use them.,2,0,B0787GLBMV

Amazing. For the price these are great. I have a hairy face. I guess this is 40. This has been a life saver. I’ve used other types of this over the years. This is the closest “shave” I can get. It’s been a few days and so far I still can’t feel any regrowth unlike others I've used.,5,0,B0787GLBMV

Doesn’t moisturize but be sure to use water, soap, or shaving cream instead. Still works without it :) 4/5 would definitely recommend.",4,0,B0787GLBMV

"It worked soooo well to get all the peach fuzz off my acne-prone skin! Since I've ""shaved"" my face with this, I feel like my pores can breathe better and also absorb my skincare, leading to better skin! I also use this product to shape my brows, and it has allowed me to save a lot of money that adds up from going to get my brows threaded or waxed.",5,0,B0787GLBMV

These will be a beauty staple from now on. Makes your skin so soft and products go on smoothly. No more dry skin flakes or peach fuzz/mustache. It does NOT make your hair grow back thicker or faster.

Great product for the price. My face feels baby smooth and make up is going on so nicely with no peach fuzz on face.

Omg! This is the BEST facial razor I have ever used. I have a lot of facial hair.. too much! And my hair is also very coarse. I have tried many different options. A lot of the razors out there leave stubble and require you to pass the razor over the area a few times to achieve a smooth look. Some even cut my skin and leave it feeling dry and itchy. I have suffered a lot in facial hair removal but this Schick product is a game changer. I was shocked when I first used it. One swipe over my skin and all the hair was gone - NO stubble left behind and my skin felt very smooth!!! I’ve been touching my face all day because I can’t believe how smooth it is. No more embarrassing stubbles for me!!! This is my favorite beauty product now!,5,5,B0787GLBMV

"Works as needed, make sure you use it with an aftershave ""Nivea for men aftershave for sensitive skin"" works best for my skin to avoid razor burn.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
Gets dull after two uses. Does scratch a lot of you don’t use the right angle. But the dullness is why it deserves a 1 star. Only use on face and gets dull super quick,2,0,B0787GLBMV
Omg these are amazing... why have I not tried them until now?? My face is so smooth and my make up glides on with ease and I use much less!! I also used it to touch up my brows and it worked like a charm! These will be a regular purchase for sure!!,5,0,B0787GLBMV
Love these!!! I just started shaving my face because of peach fuzz and these have not caused one single breakout even over a couple weeks later and my skin is SO sensitive. My hair has not grown back any darker either. High recommend!,5,0,B0787GLBMV
"Hi the product is good and very sharp.
For me as a first time user i have alot of cuts while trying to remove the facial hair.
If you use this kind / type before then perfect for them.
As per my experience i wont buy this :(.",4,0,B0787GLBMV
"Honestly, I don’t know what the hype is. After using the product it left my skin very very irritated, burning, and red. So I applied a hydrating sheet mask after and my skin was still super red and on fire after. Maybe I didn’t do it right, or maybe I have more sensitive skin that I thought. But I wouldn’t recommend",2,One,B0787GLBMV
Worked surprisingly well for peach fuzz and also upper lip hair!! Didnt think they would work well because of cheap price but they worked pretty well. Definitely buy this if u have peach fuzz...,5,0,B0787GLBMV

I shared one with another woman and we both love it!!!!!! Works beautifully!,5,0,B0787GLBMV
These are awful. They are serrated and not a straight blade. They are jagged and could result in cuts. I would not buy again and definitely save yourself the trouble. I used on my eyebrows carefully and I still ended up with my skin feeling raw and also they did not do a good job at all. DO NOT BUY,1,0,B0787GLBMV
"Easy to use and work fairly well. I can always feel stubble still even with my peach fuzz, granted I have dark hair so maybe that’s why.",4,0,B0787GLBMV

"Like several others have complained, the razor is uneven especially at the edge. It cut my face and was scratching as it moved across my face. It was not smooth. Very disappointed. Idk how it has this many positive reviews.",1,0,B0787GLBMV
I used it to shave my face twice and my bikini line to get all go the dead skin off of Both. I only used them once each though. Not sure if they can take more usage. I think i will be better off with going to the hair store. Only 99 cents there. But great buy.,5,0,B0787GLBMV
I love these!!!! I use this for the hair/flakes on my face!! It takes away it all and leaves my skin smooth and rejuvenated. It also doesn’t cause breakouts like other hair removal creams and razors have caused.,5,0,B0787GLBMV
Loves these and I always stay stocked. Very easy to use just be very careful. Also great to use on legs. Will always purchase these,5,0,B0787GLBMV

To make it even better, the price is very convenient and more than fair.",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"Great tool! Works well for face & for eyebrow trimming & shaping. This removes dead skin, but I didn’t consider it to have moisturizing qualities - otherwise a 5 star affordable tool.",5,0,B0787GLBMV

It’s quick. The blade is gives you a perfect clean shave.
I would highly recommend",5,0,B0787GLBMV
"This product actually works really great to remove fine hairs from the face. With that being said, however, you must take care to use very light pressure when using because as with pretty much any razor, too much pressure, no matter where its being used will cause you to get cuts which with these will look more like claw marks if youre not careful. Use gently and they work like a charm!",4,0,B0787GLBMV
I don’t know if I’m a huge fan of these. You have to pull your skin pretty hard in order to get enough traction I guess is the word I’m looking for to dermaplane. I have tried w water and on dry skin and it’s the same result: which isn’t too much of a difference. I also would NOT use near my eyebrows because it’s impossible to get precision when holding it.,4,0,B0787GLBMV

This razor works great for peach fuzz on the face. Make sure to prep your skin before shaving; just as you would before shaving your legs. I use a lite layer of jojoba oil on my face before using this product. I have sensitive skin and have no problem using this item.,5,0,B0787GLBMV
I ordered these to try microplaning my face. I was originally looking for tinkle brand as those seem to be a favorite but another review mentioned tinkle doesn’t sell on amazon.

One of the best temporary hair removal products. I use it almost every single day. Would have given it 5 stars BUT the hair does come back pretty fast which sucks :( and it does tend to hurt in some cases. Just add soap or some shaving cream so that it hurts less.,5,0,B0787GLBMV

"Look. Let's be honest. If you've got acne, you need Benzoyl peroxide. Serious acne! 10%. And this soap is perfect. Leave it on for 5-10 minutes while you chill in the shower (turn off the water to save some money). And rinse. RInse well so you don't stain your towels or clothes. Remember Benzoyl Peroxide bleaches fabrics. But yeah. I was havin a terrible outbreak on my back and started using this everyday, in addition to an exfoliating sea salt/ mud soap, and my skin has pretty much cleared up. Wear clean clothes, change your sheets (wash them often), and use this soap and you'll solve your problem (mostly). I went from bad back acne to like just one or two blemishes that disappear in a day or two. Good quality. Not cheap, not expensive. Worthwhile!",5,95,B081KL2QYJ
I’ve been using it for a little over 3 weeks now and it has cleared all my active pimples and prevented new ones from popping up. I still have acne scars that will take longer to clear but so far so good! It will dry your face so I recommend using a hydrating night cream or lotion after use. I tried proactive and proactive md and neither have worked as well as this product has in a shorter amount of time.,5,90,B081KL2QYJ
"This product is by far the best solution if you struggle with acne. I have tried millions of cleaners, creams, masks you name it i’ve tried it and nothing works as good as PanOxyl. I currently use the 10% and have since the beginning, I have heard some people experience dryness however, that has never happened with me. I swear by this product and it definitely does not get the hype it should. After one week my face was completely free of breakouts! I typically purchase this product at Target or Rite Aid however with Amazon, I get it delivered straight to my door for an even cheaper price. This product uses benzoyl peroxide instead of other typical acne treatments which is salicylic acid which only removes dead skin cells and unclogs pores. This product works by or penetrating deep with the pores killing the bacteria that causes acne! So while it’s clearing your breakouts it’s preventing new ones from starting. That being said this product does contain peroxide so it will stain any towels or clothing it comes in contact with!",5,58,B081KL2QYJ
"Great for “mask-ne”! I’m a healthcare provider and my skin has been suffering over the last 6 months of constant mask wearing despite using prescription retinoids and other OTC topical products. This was recommended by a dermatologist to me. It’s been a godsend for my face - and I’ve only been using it for a little over one week. Just be careful because the benzoyl peroxide will bleach your clothes if it gets on them. If you don’t rinse well, it’ll also discolor your pillowcases or towels.",5,40,B081KL2QYJ
"I have oily and acne prone skin and this was recommended by my dermatologist few years ago. It definitely dries the skin when I first started using it so I recommend titrating use weekly. I’d start once a day every other day, once daily, then finally twice daily. I don’t recommend for sensitive skin. It also bleaches towels and clothing So use old towels. I liked the creamier formula it used to be.. this formula is creamy but more runny. Not bad though.",5,44,B081KL2QYJ
My daughter used prescription acne medicines and this product works for her just as well. Also way cheaper than the required Dr visits that go along with the prescriptions.,5,37,B081KL2QYJ
It dries out the skin but not too bad if you don’t use too much. I used for acne in my back and worked really well. I recommend it for anyone having acne problems but attention it dries out the skin so use common sense.,5,34,B081KL2QYJ
"I started using this 1/13/21 and I’m writing this review 2/25/21. The first week I only washed with it once to see if I would have a reaction since I have very sensitive skin. I’m including photos from each week. The next week I went to two times. Now I’m at three times a week. I am so happy I bought this. I had no reactions or sensitivities. In just a few weeks I went from covered with pimples to having very few that don’t last long at all. It has even helped with my body acne. I will forever use this wash. I will also note, I’m 35 years old and have dealt with cystic acne since I was 13. This is the clearest my face has ever been and it’s not super drying like other acne washes.",5,20,B081KL2QYJ
Product works well for my son. Only complaint is one bottle arrived with cap smashed to smithereens. I usually am glad when Amazon uses envelopes rather than boxes but this time did not work out well.,4,27,B081KL2QYJ

"I have oily, acne prone skin so I get frequent cystic acne on my chin, esp around my cycle. I tried a plethora of products but then decided to focus on products that would counteract my oils. Washing my face w/ dial soap and using Vit C serum as my only moisturizer helped but my results were more dramatic after the addition of 10% benzoyl peroxide. I wash once daily with both on most days, occasionally skipping the BP. I only moisturize w/ serum unless I see visible flakiness, which happened once. My face cleared by 1 month. I still get an occasional blemish but things are so much better now.",5,11,B081KL2QYJ
"I've always used an expensive acne facial wash from the beauty counter for my occasional hormonal break outs. It was great until the pandemic started and I started getting maskne! It wasn't helping at all and after buying 4 different acne products from the store, none of them worked. So of course, I took to Amazon. I'm sick of trying to cover my acne and sick of having it. So I figured why not, I've already spent quite a bit of money on other products, I'll give this a try. I put a little on my clarisonic brush and Yall, after using it 2 times, my skin was completely clear! Even my occasional breakouts were gone! I have no zits at all! I will mention I don't have sensitive skin but this did tend to dry my skin out. Make sure you use a good moisturizer after using it! I will no longer be wasting tons of money at the beauty counter and will be using this for now on.
Bottom line, if you're struggling with maskne and are frustrated, give it a shot! Worked for me!",5,8,B081KL2QYJ
"Price effective alternative to benzoyl peroxide Proactive face wash. I do alternate with the economy version of Aveeno daily exfoliator. This is drying if you leave it on past the necessary wash time. I have oily skin with flake-prone areas under my eyes and around my mouth. Salicylic acid products clean fine, but do not manage hormonal acne. In my experience, benzoyl peroxide helps dry up the oil cysts faster and seems to reduce the size of them. It doesn't stop the breakout altogether, but I am significantly less embarrassed by my skin as the bumps heal faster and are small enough to mask with makeup. Using these in conjunction with Nexcare acne patches has been the most effective solution I can find for my budget. ($10 Panoxyl, $3 Equate (Aveeno dupe) daily exfoliation wash, and $4 acne patches). You will likely need an effective moisturizer when using this product. This product will take dye out of fabrics so be mindful of that if you're hoping to preserve color in a wash cloth or face towel.",5,6,B081KL2QYJ
"It's not thick, it is very watery. I have been using for to weeks now and it has significantly lightened my butt area and inner thighs and has cleared my butt acne. The 10% one is good if you want faster results but just be sure to moisturize after because it does leave your skin tight and dry. But this product is good and does work so far. I will restock incase of another global shutdown.",5,7,B081KL2QYJ
"This is my holy grail back wash! I suffered from back acne since middle school....I’m 28 now. This is the only thing that stops my back from breaking out. I think the formula may have changed, but I actually like it more because it’s easier to get out of tube, but it’s still effective. Beware, this will dry you out. I use it every time I shower.",5,10,B081KL2QYJ
I suffer with cystic acne. I am in my 30s and African American. I recently incorporated this product in my acne routine. It is pretty drying so be sure to use a good moisturizer. I use it once daily and a salicylic acne wash the other time. This mix works for me so far.,5,7,B081KL2QYJ
"Okay, I was very skeptical in trying this because I’ve seen reviews that mentioned the formula changed or that they broke out after using this consistently. That isn’t the case for me, I really like this product.

So during my first two weeks of using it, my face started to feel leathery and I did break out. But, by the third week, I started peeling. By the fourth week, I basically had a fresh set of skin. This product does wonders for me.

I used this product as my “second wash,” once every night, then followed with an AHA/BHA balanced toner (CosRX), and then a vitamin moisturizer (Wishtrend). It was definitely ugly before it got better, but that’s how it works! I go through this cycle of bad skin to good skin as my cells are turning over, and this face wash assists in this turnover as well as preventing the dead skin cells from clogging up my pores. After the purging period, it’ll only get better from there.

I highly recommend this product for people with tolerant and oily skin. For sensitive skin, I recommend the 4% PanOxyl. If your skin can tolerate benzoyl peroxide, definitely go for the 10% for faster results.",5,4,B081KL2QYJ
"I saw this recommended on tik tok for people that struggle with sweating and bad odor from armpits. With a one time use it has worked for me. It was only this year when I got pregnant that I started having hot flashes and would just sweat way too much and I would also have really bad armpit odor. I thought it would go away and after I had my baby but nope, until I found about this product.",5,7,B081KL2QYJ
"I am a 17 year old who struggles with back acne and have been for a while, Id shower everyday & wash my back but would still get acne, but ever since purchasing this (I gave myself a month to see results) I have little to NO acne on my back (it’s still lightening scars and clearing it up). I use it everyday after my showers, I apply it like lotion on my back (I don’t rinse it off like it says) and let it air dry with nothing on your back & you’ll see results!!!! I’ve tried salicylic acid soaps & other back acne soaps & nothing worked but this is a steal ESPECIALLY for the price! Get it & it will change your life!",5,5,B081KL2QYJ
I’ve been using this consistently Twice a day and I can see a difference in my face I suffer from dark spots and this works very well.,5,7,B081KL2QYJ
"The first time I used it I noticed my face was a little sensitive to it, however, the next day it was fine and I noticed a slight difference it made to my pores and the few pimples I get due to hormonal and fungal acne. I would definitely recommend this for someone who suffers with acne. Also, since it is a deep exfoliator I recommend only using it at night with a heavy moisturizer and sunscreen during the day!",5,6,B081KL2QYJ
"Probably the first skincare product I’ve bought off Amazon that was actually sealed and I didn’t question its authenticity. This is the best brand for my sensitive acne prone combo skin because it doesn’t burn and I get no purging period. It seems to just dry my acne up. It does dry the skin so I wouldn’t suggest this to anyone with dry skin. I have no issues with this bleaching anything, and it DOES foam, I have seen reviews stating it doesn’t but this is not true. You just need to use enough product + enough water to get the right mixture down. What else can I say? It does not burn my skin like other cleansers. I love it.",5,3,B081KL2QYJ
This face cleanser bleached several of my new towels. Extremely Unhappy about that. I don't know how well this works for clearing up acne because I only used it twice before I realized that it was ruining my towels.,1,5,B081KL2QYJ
"I love this cleanser! I have very sensitive combination skin and this makes my skin feel so good! With only two days or twice daily use, I noticed softer, smoother skin and a remarkably quick reduction in redness and prominence of the acne I had developed near my chin as a result of mask wearing. I am very picky about my skincare products and I love this one. This is way better than the expensive cleansers I have tried before:",5,5,B081KL2QYJ
"I wouldn't say I have severe acne but I do get nasty breakouts on my skin, I tried using other acne products but I would always continuously get breakouts, I've been using this product for several weeks and have noticed a positive change on my skin, my skin is a lot more clear and brighter.",5,5,B081KL2QYJ
"I’ve been dealing with acne since I was 15 and I’m 40 now. For years I’ve been changing my facial wash. Last year my acne flared up around my mouth and developed into cystic acne. I went to my dermatologist and gave me topical prescription medication and recommended this face wash. It is very strong and will dry your skin but it helps when you have breakouts. What I do is in the morning wash with water then at night use a small amount of this face wash. If I have a bad breakout which I haven’t had in a while I will use it 2x a day.

It does work however because it’s benzoyl peroxide it will dry your skin so be sure to moisturize after you wash your face with this product.",5,3,B081KL2QYJ
"Most Acne products use Salicylic Acid which never helped, actually it dried my skin out and when I used it as a body wash, it didn't even remove the BO mid-shower.

So I switch to Benzoyl Peroxide. I don't have a brand preference, this is as good as all the other brands I can get my hands on. It doesn't lather, but it's not difficult to wash your face with it either. There's really no scent to it, which is perfectly fine to me. After using it, once my skin it dry, my skin doesn't look or feel oily or greasy, it itself doesn't dry or irritate my skin. What does give me pimples is exercising without bathing afterwards and sugary holidays, yum.",5,One,B081KL2QYJ
I’ve been using this since I played soft all and suffered from really bad back acne and chest acne due to the dirt and nastieness of my catchers gear. It’s one of the few products that has never failed me. I still use to on my chest and my back and face and any place prone to acne. I highly recommend this to anyone suffering from mask-acne or whose an athlete who suffers from acne. It’s a staple in my skin care routine. However make sure that in the summer especially you wear sun screen and if your face is prone to dryness use a facial moisturizer that works for you cause it can dry you out and it can make your skin more sensitive to the sun.,5,One,B081KL2QYJ
Love this. A dermatologist suggested to use this under armpits. It kills bacteria and it works great. I always have this in my shower.,5,6,B081KL2QYJ
"PanOxyl has really helped me clear up my skin, it’s been a miracle worker. A little drying but nothing too crazy. I DID STAIN MY TOWEL AND SHIRT it kinda bleached them so when you rinse your face make sure you do it very thoroughly. Other than that it’s a great product.",4,5,B081KL2QYJ
"I was recommended to use this by my dermatologist and it definitely works! I have oily acne prone skin, and I actually do not use this much for my face because it is a very strong. However, I do use this for all of my body acne and it works so well! Not effective immediately but it definitely works in 5-8 washes depending on how bad the acne is. It does not feel bad on the skin and feels more like a regular soap. Definitely recommend for body acne more so than face acne just because it is maximum strength.",5,3,B081KL2QYJ
"I have tried so many face/ body washes with benzoyl peroxide and they never work. If you consistently wash with this product everyday, your acne will be gone. I wear athletic clothing daily have not had any issues.",5,4,B081KL2QYJ
"I have been using salicylic acid in the past which started working and then stopped, so I was eager to find another acne remedy. I have sensitive, oily skin with blackheads and whiteheads. When I apply it to my face I massage it in for 1-2 minutes as the instruction states with either my hands or facial brush. I'm not sure how effective it is as yet but I notice two pimples decreased in size without me popping it. Also, it has only been a week since I've started using it. My skin has not been showing any signs of drying or peeling. I will give an update after a month's time.

P.S. Once, I used natural Tumeric and honey mask after using Panoxyl and noticed my skin felt irritated. So, I chose not to use it right after but instead hours after using Panoxyl cleanser and my skin felt ok.",3,0,B081KL2QYJ
"I have sensitive skin and struggled with acne on my shoulders and back.
I used it once a day for a week and I was starting to clear up and on the second week I was breaking out even more.
I continued to use it on the 3rd week and now I'm almost cleared! It can be drying but that's why I only use it once a day.
Nothing ever worked until I used this.",5,3,B081KL2QYJ
"This product is saving my self esteem. I had gotten Nexplanon (the worst birth control ever, stay away from it) and I went from never having acne ever to basically cystic acne. My picture is my 1 week difference using this wash twice a day. I had seen it make a difference just from the first use! Make sure to wash it all off or it will leave kind of like a slimy feeling, if you don’t know how to rinse yourself you’re an idiot. Anyways! Highly recommend!! Make sure to moisturize afterwards and use sunscreen!",5,One,B081KL2QYJ
"Okay so I struggle with acne on my chest, back and face. I go and get acne facials once a month. And while the facials do a lot I was always struggling in between treatments. I would NOT recommend this for sensitive skin, it’s can pull a lot of the bacteria out when first using so I noticed a lot of white heads. This is clinical grade so I notice a slight stinging sensation (My skin does get dry with this product)- but that’s the point. After continuing the treatment with this product I have seen a huge change! Clearer skin and less break outs.
I saw some reviews saying it bleached their towels so they stopped using it.. on the back of the bottle it says that is a possibility with this product.
There isn’t really a scent which I find is better for skin when dealing with acne.
I have subscribed to this product!! Thank you!!",5,0,B081KL2QYJ
"I’ve waited to write a review until my bottle is almost empty. I’m 33, have combination skin, with hormonal outbreaks regularly. I started using this and was so hopeful it would help repair my blotchy skin where previous outbreaks happened, and prevent future outbreaks. Truth be told, I don’t see much difference in my skin. I still suffer from breakouts. My skin gets very irritated if I use this too frequently, and feels almost like it’s burning on my sensitive areas under my eyes. My nose is very dry and peeling, but forehead remains pretty oily. I need to switch to something else. Lastly, I should’ve read the bottle more carefully... the hydrogen peroxide in this bleached my darker towels and ruined them! Be careful!",3,0,B081KL2QYJ
"I've been using this for about a week now and (thank goodness) it works for me! I wanted something similar to the wash in my Proactive box, yet didn't come with the extra bottles or the subscription. I found this and thought I'd give it a shot. Happy so far. No adverse reactions. I cancelled my subscription, that's how happy I am with this product. Just remember, all skin is different. My skin was different prior to pregnancy and nothing ever worked. Now, I have better luck. Thank goodness for that too. This was also packaged well, no leaks or breaks. It does smell like a swimsuit but I can get past that. I've used much worse smelling stuff in the past.",5,0,B081KL2QYJ
"I ordered this to help with some pimples scattered mostly across my body and elbows. I’ve been using it almost daily but to no improvement. It makes my skin dry and does not foam at all. The first day or two I did notice a slight improvement in my skin tone but eventually went back to breaking out.

The pictures attached are how my elbows are after almost one month of use. Maybe I need something stronger? Maybe a prescription? But overall personally this product hasn’t been very beneficial to me.
Not only that, the first squeeze was almost completely air, half the bottle shrunk after that! But to be fair, still a very cheap price for the amount...",2,0,B081KL2QYJ
"I've been using it for the last 4 days and wow I already see a huge difference. I don't really have sensitive skin but I did notice some irritation around my eyes and eyesbrows, but other than that nothing else. My skin has been awful because of the masks and I decided to pick this up after I saw it on Tik Tok. I still have acne scars left but all of my active pimples are gone. I use this in the morning because I use Differin at night (they don't work together because they cancel one another out), it feels really good to start my day off with a super clean face. because I have noticed some irritation I will be using this every other day and using just the 4% Benzoyl just to give my skin a break. Cant wait to see what a difference my skin will be in a month or two.",5,One,B081KL2QYJ
"I have PCOS which causes me to get big, painful cystic acne on my face/neck. This is the only wash that actually does something and I've tried just about everything, from Differin, DRMTLGY, and Cerve. The reason this works so well is because unlike the other products I've mentioned, this has 10% benzoyl peroxide, while the others only have 5% or less. But that same ingredient makes this product very drying, so pair it with a good moisturizer with spf and your good to go. I also suggest to follow the instructions and only begin with using it once daily to see how your skin reacts.",5,0,B081KL2QYJ
Can be very drying. Good for spot treatments (always washed off shortly after it dried) or an all over wash. I’ve been told this can be used as a underarms deodorizer due to it cleansing bacteria. After having my son my hormones went crazy and this helped sooo much. If this is irritating try a lower percentage of benzoyl peroxide. I didn’t experience any bleaching as I was in the shower most the time with it and made sure to wash it all off. Spot treatment was at the bowl or before a shower. Always follow up with a good moisturizer. Since it is a drying I will only use this when acne is acting up and go back to salicylic acid and my retinol creams.,5,0,B081KL2QYJ
"I know this is a popular product, seen it in the drugstores too but i didnt really see much results. It made my skin drier and red. Def. not for sensitive skins. Im trying other acne products. this one is a pass for me",3,2,B081KL2QYJ
"Whenever I workout heavily I am more prone to back/chest acne and this stuff is amazing. I use neutrogena body clear body wash first all over my body and then I use this stuff on my ""problem"" areas. It has helped prevent tons of breakouts and gotten rid of some very quickly. I have super sensitive skin and this does not bother my skin. There is not much of a scent in my opinion. I don't use this on my face unless I have a really bad breakout, but I have before with no issues.",5,0,B081KL2QYJ
"Been using this face wash once a day (usually at night if I had make up on during the day or in the morning after my workout). Keeps my acne in check and I've noticed that I rarely break out anymore. It dries out your skin though, so make sure you moisturize well afterwards! If you have dry skin normally, I would either stay away from this or only use it a couple times a week. This has a very high Benzoyl peroxide content so be careful! Definitely does it job!",5,One,B081KL2QYJ
"I've had acne on my body which I'm quite terrified to admit to others, let alone show. I saw some users on a forum recommend this product and that's what I did. I went in expecting nothing really.

2 months later and man, my acne has really improved! It used to be very abundant as I have eczema and sensitive skin, but this product worked really well and my skin improved(although not completely). Would I buy it again? Damn right I would. Should you buy it? I hope so! Although like every other product, your mileage may vary.",5,0,B081KL2QYJ
Great for those with H.S. Ive had it my whole life pretty much but finally correctly diagnosed with it. this definitely helps. Its not the cheapest but it works.,4,4,B081KL2QYJ
this. product. cleared. my. texture!!!!!!! it is great at controlling hormonal acne. ever since i started using it my texture has cleared and my pimples go away faster. i use it in the morning and i use zapzyt salicylic facewash at night. along with my serum and moisturizer. i also use panoxyl on my back and it works great. also its not super foamy which i like since it doesn’t leave the skin super dry after using it.,5,2,B081KL2QYJ
"I wish I would have discovered this awesome product years ago! After struggling with stubborn acne for years and trying all the expensive face washes and creams and exfoliators, nothing has come close to clearing my face up like this product has! I use it twice a day and it has yet to dry my face out, but it has cleared most of my acne! It will take the color out of fabric so beware!",5,One,B081KL2QYJ
"I don't have face acne... I have back acne. I tried charcoal body wash, special charcoal sponges, and other over the counter products and this is the only one that has worked. I use a back scrubber thing to apply the lotion and let it sit there for about 1-2 minutes before rinsing it off. I saw it working nearly immediately and now, about two weeks later or so my back is looking better than it has in years. Just ordered more.",5,0,B081KL2QYJ
"I've had bacne since adolescence and using this on my back and chest during shower combined with Amlactin daily lotion after has gotten rid of all the itchy acne! It smells expectedly medicated of course and will be drying if used every shower, but it worked for me! I'm so happy and feel like a huge weight has lifted off my shoulders. I've always hidden my back...couldn't wear tank tops...family would comment on it constantly...was a bridesmaid for multiple weddings wearing a backless dress...Going to a derm prescribed me antibiotics that were only a temporary fix and gave me severe stomach aches every day. This was the cheapest and easiest fix for me! Will buy for life.",5,0,B081KL2QYJ
"My only complaint about this product is, it does not foam or lather like it says. It goes on like a lotion and that's it. However, it WORKS! I had very stubborn deep red pimples on my forehead that would not go away for weeks. I tried this and they are gone! I use only after working out when my skin more prone to breakouts. It does stain fabrics. Lol. So be careful. It bleached my head pillows.",4,0,B081KL2QYJ
"I never write product reviews but this stuff... Great. I would recommend starting off with washing your face with this every other day to get your skin used to it. I do not wash my face with this twice a day, only once a day and i skip days periodically. I’ve noticed a difference in 3 weeks! Probably less. But i recommend using a good moisturizer & i use vitamin C serums as well because this stuff is strong and i want to keep moisture and vitamins in my skin. Great product. It worked when nothing else would. My skin hasn’t been this clear in a year. Just working on getting rid of the old acne scars now 🥰 get it. Worth the try.",5,0,B081KL2QYJ

I do not have sensitive skin and this product made me breakout even more. I tried it because i had a few pimples on my chin and forehead and after using this about 4 days not consecutively i started to notice that I was breaking out more. After a week of using this i completely stopped using it and my skin cleared up a bit.,2,One,B081KL2QYJ
"I’ve had horrible back acne forever. This product gets rave reviews from derms and skin-influencers for a reason. It does have Benzoyl Peroxide in it and the stuff does stain fabrics and have potential to dry your skin. So far, I haven’t seen any staining at all. It’s cleared up the acne extremely well - but it’s not completely gone. I use it often, but lately I’ve noticed my skin’s a little itchy (not flakey, irritated, or anything), so I’m going to limit it to 3x per week with moisturizer. The stuff smells like any Benzoyl Peroxide product but it’s not exceptionally strong at all. Overall, the product works wonderfully, but, like with any skin product, use it gradually to assess your tolerance and give your skin breaks when using it as well. Also, use it in the shower and rinse VERY well to try to avoid staining towels, shirts, etc.",4,0,B081KL2QYJ
"I used this product for about a month, it was working great. However, closer to the one month mark, I realized that I was having an allergic reaction to it. It was subtle at first but then increased to rashes all over my face, severe dryness and scaling, 3 scabs around my jawline, and it left my eye area dark red, almost purple. I can’t use any other skin care, not even sun screen, until I’m fully recovered from my allergic reaction and it has been 3-4 days. I’ve never been so allergic to any other skincare product. Which is crazy to me because I had been using it for a month. Please be careful if you decide to use this and watch out for things like this.",2,0,B081KL2QYJ

"I like this formulation of Panoxyl. It doesn’t really foam but spreads well so you don’t need to use a lot. I use this for my shaved scalp, armpits, and face. It’s very gentle even in the 10% formulation.",4,One,B081KL2QYJ
Didn’t entirely clear acne but it helped it from getting worse. Dried out pimples and helped balance the moisture of my oily skin.,3,2,B081KL2QYJ
"Nothing super special about it - I use it on my shoulders and back to help minimize acne flares and it works well. I don’t notice any irritation, I use it 2-3 times a week and leave it on for 3-ish minutes before using a loofah to gently scrub and rinse. The key is to make sure you leave it on for more than 60 seconds so the medication actually had time to penetrate and work. It has a medical-chemical kind of smell but nothing overpowering and it doesn’t last after rinsing.",5,0,B081KL2QYJ
This product did not have any effect on my acne actually it made it worse! I had higher expectations from this product. Also this product does not lather so the feel is of applying a cream cleanser than foaming.,2,2,B081KL2QYJ
I have super sensitive acne prone skin .. since 2018 my skin got really bad ! And this has been the only thing that has helped since using products ! I’ve been using it for 2 weeks and this is the fastest improvement I’ve seen since using any skincare product. People have been complaining about it being drying to the skin but I haven’t experienced that because I use rosehip oil for moisture. Do suggest using something that won’t clog pores but high in moisture and limit skin care routine to just panaoxyl and repeat over with moisturized .. no toner !! Once in a while .. that cause major drying,5,0,B081KL2QYJ

This product is amazing. I've been having back acne for a while now and it’s been quite the journey to find a good product to help with my acne. As a female athlete sweat builds up especially in the sports bra area. I’ve only used this product for about a week straight every night and my back acne has gone away. A few tips if you’re struggling with anybody acne... SHOWER after any type of workout or even if you sweat. Using Pan Oxly after every work out in the shower has helped keep my back clean and no acne. The consistency of the solution is thick but liquidity so in the middle. There is no scent and my skin has not acted out or dry skin. Good luck!,5,0,B081KL2QYJ
Works amazing for maskne! All the reviews stand to be true but I do want to note that each time I use this when i’m rinsing it off It’s getting into my eyes and burning them extremely bad for about 10 minutes. I never use the product around my eyes but for some reason during the rinsing process it’s still somehow making its way in. Going to try to proceed with even more caution and see if I can find a way around this.,4,One,B081KL2QYJ

"Didn’t work for me but could just be my skin. Also curious as to why the name has “foaming” in it because my product did not foam at all when washing my back with it.

Did nothing",3,One,B081KL2QYJ

"I’ve had fairly clear skin all my life with the exception of the occasional breakout. I got this product hoping to lessen those breakouts even more and reduce blackheads. This did absolutely nothing for me, I noticed no improvements whatsoever. Some reviews said it takes 6 weeks of use to actually work so I’ve been using it for 6+ weeks and nothing. The only way I can try to justify this is the fact that I only use it once per day instead of the recommended 2. Or maybe it does work better for those who have more serious acne. Either way it did not work for me and I would not recommend it if you’re just trying to clear up minor breakouts.",2,0,B081KL2QYJ

Good at clearing up acne but could dry out your skin with continuing use. I would say use it. Take a break. Use another good face soap like CeraVe then go back to using this or use the this every other day or something like that. The Benzoyl Peroxide i believe is what cause the drying effect and also help clear the acne. This was the only thing that helped cleared my son's acne.,5,0,B081KL2QYJ

I have sensitive oily/combination skin. This does strip your face and is a bit harsh but it works if you pair it with a moisturizer after every use.

"Love this, would recommend to anyone battling acne. I have oily acne prone skin, however sometimes I struggle with combination skin (some dry patches, some oily), but I find that if I continue through it, and use this wash every day 2 times a day, the dryness stops and my skin “overcomes” it and after a few weeks my skin sees fewer breakouts and stays relatively clear.

I have pretty sensitive skin too and it's gentle enough not aggravate my skin but strong enough to clean it thoroughly and get rid of oil and clogged pores.,5,0,B081KL2QYJ
"I got the maximum strength product, I think it is helping me get rid of some of my stubborn acne spots that won't go away. My face is not super sensitive, so I would use this twice a day when I feel necessary. It massages it onto my face, focusing it on my problem area. I make sure to have a good moisturizer afterward to hydrate my skin.",5,0,B081KL2QYJ
"This is fantastic. My achne is so much better after only one week. It hasn't dried my face out yet, but the maximum strength ones usually do. I've only been using this one once a day, and so far so good! I have naturally oily skin and this is great.",5,2,B081KL2QYJ

"This product was suggested for my daughters teen acne and stubborn acne. Wearing her hockey helmet has caused a lot of acne around her forehead and chin where the chin strap lays. We use strides pads on the helmet but still have issues with flare ups.
So she started using this and no issues and cleared up quickly!
Now I use it on my adult prone acne skin and I rarely have a blemish! It’s a bit strong at first use sparingly until you adapt to the formula. Once a day until you notice no redness or irritation!

"Due to Covid I have gotten bad maskne on my chin, so bad it turned into cystic acne!

I started using this product a couple months ago since benzoyl peroxide is antibacterial and needed during these times due to the mask. After my first use I saw a massive difference. The big red painful pimples were less inflamed. Now, my maskne is gone. I am just working on getting rid of dark spots. Moral of review: buy it!! And use a moisturizer after.

I’m giving it 5 stars because I expected a miracle and didn’t get one. I tried to replace nightly Benzoyl peroxide gel 2.5% application with this. Not effective like my usual gel. Dried out face and didn’t keep hormonal jaw and chin acne controlled. Oh well.,5,30,B081KL2QYJ
"Tried this for about a month and a half, and it didn’t clear up much but it also did a good job of preventing new breakouts. BUT apparently I have sensitive skin, and after about a month and a half of use, it caused blotchy red marks on my face and neck! Benzoyl peroxide is very strong (it completely bleaches whatever towel you’re using), and it can really dry up your skin. For me, it didn’t dry my skin very much, and I did use it twice a day, but it’s in my trash now!
Overall, I wouldn’t recommend this if you have sensitive skin, but it didn’t do any permanent damage if you do want to try it (the redness went away after two days of not using the face wash anymore).",5,10,B081KL2QYJ
This works wonders on my daughter's closed comedones on her forehead. Salycic acid never helped her. She does however only use the 10% once a day or it starts to dry her skin out.

My 15 yr. old son just started using this. His doctor's office recommended. He applies it to his face and jumps into the shower.

I was recently on Amazon looking for benzoyl peroxide and found PanOxyl. I decided to give it a try. I've been using it for about a week and some of the painful pimples have begun try dry out. I hoping this product continues to work.
I consider the scalp sensitive, so yes it's good for that.

I used this product for a month on my back acne and keratosis pilaris on my backside. I didn’t see much improvement with continued use this product almost on a daily basis. It prevented more breakouts but I don’t feel it cleared my skin. Not until I used AHA cream on those areas it really cleared the skin. I probably won’t buy this again.

"I'm in my mid 20s and still suffer from moderate acne/oily skin. I used Neutrogena Rapid Clear Cleanser for about 5 years but that product appears to have been discontinued as of July 2020 so I needed a replacement fast.

PanOxyl on paper is better since it doesn't use fragrance and has the same 10% Benzoyl Peroxide. My skin doesn't necessarily look better but it didn't cause breakouts either. It's hard to switch cleansers after so many years, it might get better results as time goes on and skin adjusts to it. I've only been using for 3 weeks but so far so good.",4,9,B081KL2QYJ
"I have tried everything you can think of to help clear my skin. I’m a 27 year old woman who has struggled with acne since age 12. Nowadays it’s mainly cystic and painful. I have gone on Accutane, tried different rounds of meds and creams. If you name it, I’ve probably been on it. I tried switching up my diet (which I’ll admit helps a little bit) to avoid dairy, bread and too much pre packaged food. My best friend told me about this a couple years ago and I decided to finally try it. I don’t know why I waited so long. Within a few days of using, my skin drastically calmed down and I really haven’t had too bad of a breakout since starting three weeks ago. I am amazed. I have gotten so many compliments on my skin lately and this is the only thing that’s changed!! My routine at night: I remove my makeup with a fragrance free makeup wipe (I know some people hate them, but I find it gets my makeup off easier and more thorough), cleanse with this Panoxyl gently for about 15-20 seconds, rinse, use a toner and moisturize using CeraVe night cream. It has dramatically changed my skin! I avoid using it in the morning to avoid drying my skin too much, so I usually use a gentle astringent in the morning, then cleanse with water. I bought mine from Target so I don’t know how the Amazon packaging is, but it is definitely worth a try!!",5,One,B081KL2QYJ
"I’ll start off by saying that I don’t have acne, it’s not something I ever really experienced. So why did I buy this product? I learned from a friend that this product can be used to decrease underarm odor. It makes sense too, because underarm odor is caused by bacteria on the skin, and this destroys bacteria. So I decided to try it. I’ve only been using it a few weeks now, but my armpits have never smelled better than they do now. This works so much better than deodorant. Not sure why this isn’t a more common use for this product. Love it! Will be using forever!",5,0,B081KL2QYJ
this is hands down amazing stuff cancel your dermotologist appointment and use this everyone skin is different and if you have painful bumps that come up this will defenatly work for you just dont leave it on skin too long and rinse been using it for years always put moisturizer after company is amazing and been around ling i been using thier soap wich is stronger for back acne etc for 12 years and had no brakouts ever since only thing that worked tried all other stuff before.,5,0,B081KL2QYJ
"This wash is AMAZING! I can finally leave this house without makeup. My pics are after and before using this product from March 2021 on left and Nov. 2020 on right. I started out with the 10% because my acne was pretty bad... Then for mild breakouts I use the 4% as a spot treatment. USE WITH CAUTION. My skin is extremely sensitive so I accidentally got some just under my eye bag area and the next morning I woke up with swollen rashy eyes. I get a rash if I get it too close under my neck area as well. My suggestion, use a moisturizing wash like Nuetrogena cleanser and then spot treat with this stuff every other day if your acne is bad. Try to use once a week for mild break outs to manage. Remember to moisturize with Vanicream or a very light product throughout the day. My skin is very dry. For one or two blemishes cover with the acne patches product this company also carries. I LOVE this stuff but everyone’s skin is different so just spot treat at first until you know what works for you.",5,0,B081KL2QYJ

But I have been using retinol for a couple years now and acids so my skin didn’t give me any trouble when I started with this at 10%. Sometimes I use it as a spot treatment, others once a day and other times I use it alternating days.

I left it on last night for 15 minutes and noticed some very minor peeling for the first time.

"I purchased this January 14th and wanted to wait a bit to do an update. I’ll preface this by saying I’ve been moisturizing with Amlactin: Ultra smoothing intensely hydrating body cream for my body.
I started this with my face and butt which were my problem areas and ended up using it for my butt, arms, and inner thighs.
For my face there was not significant enough change to continue using as it made my face extremely dry. My face during the winter is naturally dry so using this was not helpful at all and I had some days where my cheeks were very red but most days they were alright.
My real problem area was my butt and thighs- I wear lots of tight clothes and skirts so used to get lots of bumps on my butt and sometimes would get cysts on my inner thighs because of rubbing.
It was very painful and annoying but I started using this product and after a month of use it did help my butt stay smooth with no red bumps in sight. The cysts still come back to my thighs but not as often and I’ve gotten none on my butt. Now my boyfriend rubs me and tells me how soft and smooth I am which I love.
I’d say this body wash smells like nothing but that’s not true it smells almost like chlorine when you’re about to go to a hotel pool (strong)",4,0,B081KL2QYJ

"GAME CHANGER!

I get back/shoulder/lay acne from sweating at the gym and skin not exfoliating constantly. So I was told by my doctor to try a benzoyl peroxide wash daily when I shower. This is pretty popular and available in many stores so I figured I’d try it.

It worked SO WELL for me. My skin got noticeably better after like 2-3 weeks and it keeps new acne from developing like it used to.

I leave it on for like 3 minutes when I shower and then make sure to rinse off REALLY WELL. Otherwise this can slowly bleach your towel if you don’t! It’s nothing too crazy but just rinse off with plenty of water.

Before is darker pic, lighter pic is after a few weeks of use. And it keeps getting better!",5,0,B081KL2QYJ
"I have combination, acne prone skin. I started using this product slowly, once every few days to start, but quickly saw how harsh it was. My skin started pealing from the dryness it caused.
